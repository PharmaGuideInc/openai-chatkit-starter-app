{"name": "OrgaranHIT", "input": "How to store OrgaranHIT?", "reference_doc": "ORGARAN is intended primarily for subcutaneous and intravenous use. When administered as an intravenous bolus or infusion, it should be given separately and not mixed with other drugs. However, ORGARAN is compatible with, and therefore, can be added to, the following infusions: normal saline, dextrose/saline, Ringer’s or Lactated Ringer’s and mannitol. In these solutions it remains stable for up to 48 hours at room temperature.\n\nIn patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine levels ≥220 µmol) the second and subsequent doses of ORGARAN may have to be reduced because the half-life of plasma anti-factor Xa activity may be prolonged. The dosage may require adjustments in order to keep the anti-Xa levels similar to those in normal patients. ORGARAN should be used with caution and the plasma anti-Xa activity monitored in case of accumulation. At steady-state (3-4 days after initiation of therapy), consistent plasma levels of >0.5 anti-Xa units are indicative of accumulation and, therefore, suggest that dosage should be decreased or temporarily withdrawn.\n\nEach ampoule of sterile, isotonic solution contains: 0.6 mL of danaparoid sodium (750 anti-Xa units), sodium sulphite 0.9 mg, sodium chloride to isotonic, hydrochloric acid to pH 7.0 and water for injection to 0.6 mL. The anti-Xa unit is derived from the international heparin standard in an antithrombin-III containing buffer system. It is suitable for subcutaneous and intravenous injection. Glass ampoules of 1 mL.
