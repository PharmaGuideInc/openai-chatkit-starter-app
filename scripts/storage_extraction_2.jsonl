A small amount was excreted in the bile and the balance was apparently stored in the tissues. When administered parenterally, approximately 25% of the dose was found in the urine as a water-soluble metabolite.\n\nFollowing discontinuation of the drug, blood levels fell, but persisted for several weeks due to the long terminal elimination half-life of mitotane (median 53 days; range 18-159 days). In most patients blood levels became undetectable after six to nine weeks. In one patient who had received a total of 1900 g of LYSODREN, high blood levels were found ten weeks after stopping the drug. Autopsy data have provided evidence that LYSODREN is found in most tissues of the body. Fat tissues were the primary site of storage. In one patient a very large number of tissues were examined and the drug was found in essentially every tissue.\n\nEach one-half inch, biconvex, round, compressed, white tablet, bisected on one side and impressed with “BL” over “L1\" on the other side, contains: mitotane 500 mg.

Nonmedicinal ingredients: citric acid monohydrate, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. Single-use vials of 2 mL and 4 mL. Cartons of 10 vials. The rubber stoppers do not contain natural rubber latex. Store between 15 and 30°C. Protect from light and store in the carton until time of use. Intravenous solutions should be prepared at the time of infusion. When diluted with the recommended intravenous solutions, should be used within 24 hours if stored at room temperature (15 to 30°C) or within 72 hours if stored in a refrigerator (2 to 8°C), due to possible microbial contamination during preparation. Compatibility studies have been undertaken in polyvinyl chloride infusion bags, polyvinyl chloride administration sets and polypropylene syringes. Dilutions of ondansetron in sodium chloride 0.9% or in dextrose 5% have been demonstrated to be stable in polypropylene syringes. It is considered that when diluted with other compatible infusion fluids, the product would be stable in polypropylene syringes. As with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discolouration and leakage prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Solutions showing haziness, particulate matter, precipitate, or discolouration or leakage should not be use..."}

When administered as an intravenous bolus, it should be given separately and not mixed with other drugs. However, ORGARAN is compatible with, and therefore, can be added to, the following infusions: normal saline, dextrose/saline, Ringer's or Lactated Ringer's and mannitol. In these solutions it remains stable for up to 48 hours at room temperature.\n\nIn patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine levels ≥220 µmol) the second and subsequent doses of ORGARAN may have to be reduced because the half-life of plasma anti-factor Xa activity may be prolonged. The dosage may require adjustments in order to keep the anti-Xa levels similar to those in normal patients. ORGARAN should be used with caution and the plasma anti-Xa activity monitored in case of accumulation. At steady state (3 to 4 days after initiation of therapy), consistent plasma levels of >0.5 anti-Xa units are indicative of accumulation and, therefore, suggest that dosage should be decreased or temporarily withdrawn.\n\nEach ampoule of sterile, isotonic solution contains: 0.6 mL of danaparoid sodium (750 anti-factor Xa units), sodium sulphite 0.9 mg, sodium chloride to isotonic, hydrochloric acid to pH 7.0 and water for injection to 0.6 mL. The anti-Xa unit is derived from the international heparin standard in an antithrombin-III containing buffer system. It is suitable for subcutaneous and intravenous injection.
