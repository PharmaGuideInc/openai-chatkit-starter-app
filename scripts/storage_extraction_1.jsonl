Benztropine\nexhibits anticholinergic, antihistaminic and local anesthetic properties.\nIts mechanism of action is not well understood, but it appears that\nby reducing cholinergic activity it helps to restore the functional\nbalance between acetylcholine and dopamine in the basal ganglia of\npatients with parkinsonism. The proposed ability of benztropine to\ninhibit reuptake and storage of dopamine, thereby prolonging the action\nof dopamine, may also contribute to an effect on the equilibrium between\nacetylcholine and dopamine.\n\n**Endocrine and Metabolic:** Benztropine, alone or in combination\nwith antipsychotics or other anticholinergics, may cause anhidrosis\nand/or hyperthermia, which may be fatal. Patients should avoid overheating\nfrom prolonged exposure to high environmental temperatures or from\nsustained heavy exercise. Elderly or chronically ill patients, alcoholics\nand those with cognitive impairment may be particularly vulnerable.\nIf there is evidence of anhidrosis, dosage should be decreased so\nthat the ability to maintain body temperature equilibrium through\nperspiration is not impaired. Benztropine should also be used with\ncaution in patients with fever."}

Occlusion may also lead to sweat retention and miliaria, maceration of the skin and subsequent increased risk of infection. Occlusion should not be used with high-potency topical corticosteroids or on the face or intertriginous areas.\n\n**Frequency:** Because of the repository effect of topical corticosteroids (see Action and Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics), application 1–2 times per day is usually effective. A systematic review of once-daily versus more frequent use of potent topical steroids (in atopic dermatitis) found little difference between regimens with respect to clinical outcomes [*Br J Dermatol* 2005;152(1):130-41]. Less-frequent application will reduce risk of side effects. Once control is achieved, reduce frequency of application. Gradual tapering (via lower potency agents and/or less frequent application) may be needed to prevent rebound flares in conditions that require potent or prolonged therapy. Evidence is emerging to support the use of long-term intermittent topical corticosteroid application to help keep atopic dermatitis in remission.

Protect from light and humidity.\n\n#### Special Handling Instructions\n\nSince COSMEGEN is extremely corrosive to soft tissues, it is intended for intravenous use. Animal studies have shown dactinomycin to be corrosive to skin, irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and highly toxic by the oral route. It has also been shown to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, embryotoxic and teratogenic. Due to the drug’s toxic and mutagenic properties, appropriate precautions including the use of appropriate safety equipment are recommended for the preparation of COSMEGEN for parenteral administration. Inhalation of dust or vapors and contact with skin or mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. If an extravasation occurs during intravenous use, damage to soft tissues may occur. Avoid exposure during pregnancy. The National Institutes of Health presently recommends that the preparation of injectable antineoplastic drugs should be performed in a Class II laminar flow biological safety cabinet and that personnel preparing drugs of this class should wear chemical resistant, impervious gloves, safety goggles, outer garment and shoe covers. Additional body garments should be used based upon the task being performed (e.g. sleevelets, apron, gauntlets, disposable suits) to avoid exposed skin surfaces and inhalation of vapors and dust. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.\n\nSeveral other guidelines for proper handling and disposal of antineoplastic drugs have been published and should be considered."}
