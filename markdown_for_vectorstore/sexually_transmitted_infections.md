### Introduction

In this chapter, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are presented according to whether the major initial manifestations are vaginal discharge, urethritis or cervicitis, or genital lesions. Anogenital warts and pelvic inflammatory disease are discussed as well.

While this chapter focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, STIs are often asymptomatic. Screening asymptomatic patients for STIs is an essential part of both patient care and STI control, particularly as the rates of STIs are increasing in Canada​[[1]](#PHACSTI2017) and the consequences of untreated infections may include ongoing transmission, increased risk for acquiring HIV, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of evidence on which to base screening recommendations such as whom, when and how often to screen. A 2021 systematic review suggested a possible benefit to opportunistic annual screening of all sexually active individuals under 30 years of age for chlamydia and gonorrhea.​[[2]](#Moore2021) A demonstration study of individuals taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), thus at risk for ongoing STI acquisition, suggested a benefit of STI screening as frequently as quarterly,​[[3]](#Tang2020) which is consistent with clinical guidelines for STI screening during PrEP.​[[4]](#Tan2017) Taking all factors into consideration, it is reasonable to perform an STI screening at a minimum of annually for all patients who are sexually active and more frequently if patients are at increased risk of STI acquisition.

### Goals of Therapy

- Treat the infection
- Abolish symptoms
- Decrease spread to sexual partners
- Decrease vertical transmission to newborns during birth
- Reduce transmission of HIV
- Decrease probability of complications, such as infertility, chronic pain, sepsis

### Investigations

- History:

  - onset, duration and pattern of symptoms, e.g., continuous, intermittent
  - full review of systems/functional inquiry, as some infections can present with extragenital symptoms or complications, e.g., neurosyphilis
  - sexual behaviours, e.g., sexual contact with person with known STI; recent new partner; multiple sex partners; nonbarrier contraception; exposure category, e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM; includes gay, bisexual and other MSM); sex worker​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038)
  - if sexual partners are living with HIV, whether these individuals are on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and/or have an undetectable HIV viral load
  - syndemic history, e.g., substance use, individuals with mental illness
  - type and site of sexual exposure with or without barrier protection, e.g., oral-, vaginal-, anal-receptive and/or insertive
  - risk for ascending infection, such as recent childbirth or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion
  - past history of STIs, including therapy and response
  - previous use of HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for sexual exposures
  - use of HIV PrEP
  - recent antibiotic use
- Physical:

  - search for signs of STIs, e.g., rash and/or lymphadenopathy in syphilis, or fever and/or skin lesions in disseminated gonococcal infections
  - inspect mucocutaneous regions including pharynx and anus
  - inspect external genitalia for inflammation, discharge, lesions or masses
  - consider a digital anorectal exam (DARE) and/or anoscopy if perianal warts are present or if patient has anal or rectal symptoms; also consider DARE as an initial screen in those at highest risk for anal cancer (e.g., HIV-positive MSM), the majority of which is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)
  - palpate for inguinal lymphadenopathy
  - as appropriate, perform speculum examination to visualize cervix and vaginal walls and to evaluate endocervical and vaginal discharges; perform bimanual pelvic exam to detect uterine or adnexal masses or tenderness
  - as appropriate, palpate testicles/epididymides for tenderness or masses
- Laboratory tests: when appropriate, clinicians should perform testing of extragenital sites (e.g., pharynx and rectum) for chlamydia and gonorrhea

  - for patients with a vagina:
    - patient-collected samples include first-void urine or vaginal self-collection (when collected properly, the patient-obtained samples have similar sensitivity and specificity to the physician-collected specimens)
    - clinician-collected tests include cervical or vaginal swabs
    - nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are available for chlamydia, gonorrhea and, at some centres, trichomoniasis or mycoplasma; NAATs usually will not give information on antibiotic susceptibility, though some newer testing platforms do have the ability to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR), e.g., azithromycin or fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycoplasma
    - gonorrhea cultures should be obtained whenever possible if AMR is a concern, for AMR surveillance, or if there is another indication for culture (e.g., test-of-cure in the context of an alternative agent being used)
    - vaginal swabs can be done to test for yeast or bacterial vaginosis by use of Gram stain and pH; microscopy of wet-mount preparations may be useful for trichomoniasis or yeast (i.e., microscopy is useful only when positive); antigen detection tests or culture may improve sensitivity for trichomoniasis but, overall, are less accurate than NAAT and should never be used as a substitute in settings where NAAT is available
    - ultrasound if pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is suspected
    - beta-hCG to rule out pregnancy
    - pharyngeal and rectal specimens for gonorrhea and chlamydia when appropriate; should include testing for lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) if rectal specimen is positive for chlamydia
  - for patients with a penis:
    - first-void urine for chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT
    - urethral swab for gonorrhea culture if symptomatic and available
    - pharyngeal and rectal specimens for gonorrhea and chlamydia when appropriate, including testing for LGV if rectal chlamydia positive; testing for LGV can be done by requesting serovar typing if a standard chlamydia NAAT is positive (in some jurisdictions, a positive rectal chlamydia NAAT is an automatic trigger for LGV testing)
    - consider testing non-rectal areas for LGV (culture, NAAT; serology is not generally recommended) if suspected, e.g., genital lesions
    - scrotal ultrasound if epididymo-orchitis is suspected; if testicular torsion is suspected, send for urgent evaluation as this is considered a medical emergency
  - for external lesions: swab for herpes (use viral media), bacteria (chlamydia or gonorrhea) or syphilis (swab anogenital or oral lesion for polymerase chain reaction [PCR] if available; send fluid from lesion for darkfield microscopy or direct immunofluorescence antibody test or anogenital lesions only, where available) as indicated
  - consider serology for syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and HIV (see HIV Infection: Treatment) as indicated

### Infections Characterized by Vaginal Discharge

### Etiology

The 3 infections most frequently associated with vaginal discharge are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; commonly caused by Candida albicans), trichomoniasis (caused by Trichomonas vaginalis) and bacterial vaginosis (BV; caused by a replacement of the normal vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic microorganisms, Mycoplasma and Gardnerella vaginalis). There is an element of recurrence in these conditions. [Table 1](#c0099n00009) outlines the differential diagnosis of vaginal discharge.

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Vaginal Discharge​[[5]](#c0099n00037)[[6]](#c0099n00038)

Nonsexually transmitted causes of vaginitis are numerous and include atrophic vaginitis, trauma, malignancy, contact or irritant dermatitis (e.g., detergents, contraceptive chemicals), foreign bodies, or allergy (e.g., latex condoms). Candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis are not usually considered sexually transmitted.

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0099n00010) depicts the management of vaginitis and cervicitis. [Table 3](#c0099n00307), [Table 4](#c0099n00308) and [Table 5](#c0099n00198) detail the drugs used in the treatment of trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, respectively.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Treatment of trichomoniasis with oral metronidazole is recommended for all patients with the possible exception of asymptomatic pregnant patients. Treatment of asymptomatic pregnant patients is controversial; some experts believe the benefits (e.g., reduced perinatal transmission to others) outweigh the potential risks (metronidazole-induced preterm birth or its associated morbidities). The 2005 study upon which the recommendation against treatment was based is now considered to be flawed​[[8]](#refitem-134215-BDA5A1DF) and subsequent studies have not demonstrated any negative treatment outcomes.​[[9]](#refitem-134216-BDA5A3D4)​[[10]](#refitem-134217-BDA5A55C)​[[11]](#refitem-134218-BDA5A75B)

Treat sexual partners irrespective of symptoms or test results (see [Table 3](#c0099n00307)). There are no effective alternative topical or systemic treatments available for those patients who cannot use metronidazole, e.g., patients with metronidazole hypersensitivity. In such situations, particularly if symptoms are persistent and severe, a supervised intravenous metronidazole desensitization protocol over a few hours may be the only effective treatment option.​[[13]](#PearlmanMDYasharCErnstSEtAl.AnIncre-EF261050)​[[14]](#HelmsDJMosureDJSecorWEEtAl.Manageme-EF2632D1)

Antibiotic treatment (oral or topical metronidazole, topical clindamycin) can be offered to all symptomatic patients with bacterial vaginosis. Treatment is unnecessary in asymptomatic patients except if undergoing intrauterine device (IUD) insertion, gynecologic surgery, therapeutic abortion, upper genital tract instrumentation or if pregnant and at high risk of preterm delivery​[[15]](#c0099n00539) (see [Table 4](#c0099n00308)).

Uncomplicated VVC can be treated by intravaginal azoles or oral fluconazole. Topical nystatin is less effective than topical azoles and is no longer a recommended treatment. Individualize therapy based on factors such as patient preference, cost, convenience, adherence, portability, and history of response or side effects to prior treatments. Treatment is unnecessary in asymptomatic cases.

Recurrent VVC may be prevented with a 6-month course of oral fluconazole 150 mg once weekly after induction therapy.​[[15]](#c0099n00539)​[[16]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed26001-9FCF9845) However, up to 50% of patients may experience recurrence after cessation of the extended therapy. Address potential predisposing factors such as use of systemic antibiotics, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or HIV infection (consider testing). Consider prophylactic topical or oral azoles at the start of antibiotic treatment in patients prone to recurrent VVC secondary to antibiotic use. In most cases, recurrent VVC (≥4 episodes/year) requires investigation and possibly referral (see [Table 5](#c0099n00198)).

. . . . .

### Infections Characterized by Urethritis and Cervicitis

### Etiology

The 2 main causes of urethritis and cervicitis are gonorrhea (caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and chlamydia (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis). Nongonococcal, nonchlamydial causes of urethritis and cervicitis include Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, T. vaginalis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), herpes zoster virus (VZV) and adenovirus. Patients with gonorrhea are often infected with chlamydia and should receive presumptive treatment for both, though there is a movement away from this practice due primarily to concerns around AMR.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038)​[[17]](#CDCGonorrhea2020) Test and treat sexual partners (see [Table 2](#table-11332-999F0A7A)). Symptoms may be absent and are not a prerequisite for screening individuals for STIs. While there is only low-quality evidence available to guide STI screening, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care conditionally recommends opportunistic annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active individuals <30 years.​[[2]](#Moore2021) A comprehensive STI screen should also include testing for HIV and syphilis.

Penile symptoms may include purulent discharge and severe dysuria. Complications of urethritis include epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis, prostatitis and, in gonorrhea, though rare, disseminated infection, e.g., fever, skin and/or joint involvement. If epididymo-orchitis is due to sexual transmission, empiric therapy for both gonorrhea and chlamydia is required; continue the antichlamydial regimen for at least 10 days and until resolution occurs. Scrotal elevation, bedrest and analgesics are advisable. Epididymo-orchitis may require referral to rule out other diagnoses such as testicular torsion and abscess.

Vaginal symptoms may include copious vaginal discharge, dysuria, intermenstrual uterine bleeding and menorrhagia. Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic, so screen those who are sexually active. Up to 20% of patients with gonorrhea may develop PID, which could lead to infertility. Screen all pregnant patients at first prenatal visit. Complications of cervicitis include PID, ectopic pregnancy and infertility.

Anorectal or pharyngeal gonococcal or chlamydial infection can be acquired.

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0099n00010) and [Figure 2](#c0099n00016) illustrate the management of cervicitis and urethritis, respectively. [Table 6](#c0099n00200) and [Table 7](#c0099n00199) detail the antibiotics used in the treatment of uncomplicated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections, respectively.

### Pharmacologic Choices

A test of cure for chlamydia is recommended when the preferred treatment (azithromycin or doxycycline) is not used (see [Table 6](#c0099n00200)), when symptoms persist, when reinfection is suspected, when therapeutic adherence is questioned, or when the patient is a prepubertal child or is pregnant.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) Canadian guidelines recommend repeat screening of all individuals with chlamydia infection 6 months post-treatment.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)

A test of cure for gonorrhea is recommended when preferred treatment is not used, when symptoms persist, when reinfection is suspected, when therapeutic adherence is questioned, when previous gonorrhea treatment failed, when drug resistance is suspected, or when the patient is a child or is pregnant. Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to treat; a test of cure is also recommended for all pharyngeal infections. Canadian guidelines recommend repeat screening of all individuals with gonococcal infection 6 months post-treatment.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for treating gonococcal infections in Canada and should be considered as an alternative treatment only if fluoroquinolone susceptibility is demonstrated or if local fluoroquinolone resistance is under 5% and a test of cure can be performed.​[[5]](#c0099n00037) The preferred treatment regimen for anogenital gonococcal infections is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefixime) with azithromycin.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[23]](#refitem-1352115-1E600741)​[[24]](#refitem-1352115-1E5F10F3) In patients with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea or a history of anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or allergy to cephalosporins, the recommended alternative treatment regimen is a combination of gentamicin with azithromycin,​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[23]](#refitem-1352115-1E600741)​[[25]](#refitem-1352116-1E5F4D4A) or gentamicin with doxycycline if there is evidence of macrolide-resistant infection or anaphylactic reaction to macrolides.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)

**Table 2:** Treatment of Sexual Contacts​[[5]](#c0099n00037)[[6]](#c0099n00038)

| Disease | Management of Sexual Partners |
| --- | --- |
| Anogenital warts | Likelihood of transmission and duration of infectivity unknown, but condoms associated with decreased transmission of human papillomavirus |
| Bacterial vaginosis | No treatment |
| Chlamydia and gonorrhea | Refer all recent (<60 days) partners for testing and empiric treatment (see Table 6 , Table 7 ); no sexual contact for patient or other affected individuals until 1 wk after initiation of treatment |
| Genital herpes | Use condoms; be aware of asymptomatic shedding |
| Lymphogranuloma venereum | Refer all recent (<60 days) partners for testing and empiric treatment (see Table 9 ) |
| Pelvic inflammatory disease | Refer all recent partners (<60 days) for examination and treatment (see Table 12 , Table 13 ); treat empirically for Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae ; no sexual contact for patient or other affected individuals until 1 wk after initiation of treatment |
| Syphilis, late latent | Test all long-term partners and any of their children who were possibly exposed during pregnancy |
| Syphilis, primary, secondary and early latent | Trace-back period for primary, secondary and early latent syphilis is 3 months, 6 months and 1 y, respectively; refer all partners for testing; refer all partners within previous 3 months for empiric treatment (see Table 8 ) even if seronegative |
| Trichomoniasis | Treat current partners (see Table 3 ); no sexual contact until patient and affected individuals finished treatment and are asymptomatic |
| Vulvovaginal candidiasis | No treatment; consider treatment of partners in patients with recurrent infections |

### Infections Characterized by Genital Ulcers

### Etiology

Several STIs are associated with genital ulcers including genital herpes, syphilis, LGV and chancroid. The 2 most common in North America are genital herpes (see Herpesvirus Infections) and syphilis. Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a bacterium that penetrates broken skin or mucous membranes, usually through sexual contact. Syphilis ulcers (chancres) are often single, large and painless, while genital herpes ulcers are often multiple, small, painful and vesiculoulcerative. However, there may be considerable overlap in clinical presentation of these conditions.

LGV is caused by the invasive C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2 and L3, which preferentially infect the lymphatic tissue.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) LGV is transmitted through vaginal, anal or oral sexual contact. Suspect LGV if proctitis symptoms appear in MSM, particularly if accompanied by bloody anal discharge.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) Complications include fissures, fistulae and strictures, and secondary bacterial infections. Testing for LGV is typically done at a reference laboratory and occasionally requires a special request. Test and treat sexual partners (see [Table 2](#table-11332-999F0A7A)).​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) Individuals with genital ulcers are at increased risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV.

Chancroid, caused by Haemophilus ducreyi or Klebsiella granulomatis, is rare in North America and requires special media to culture. Contact your laboratory if chancroid is suspected (1 or more painful genital ulcers with a yellow-grey base and a surrounding erythematous ring, tender and sometimes suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy, history of travel to an endemic area such as Africa, Asia or the Caribbean).

Both primary and secondary syphilis can be characterized by ulcerative infectious lesions; additionally, it is not uncommon for secondary syphilis to include end-organ involvement, sometimes with serious complications (e.g., ocular syphilis, neurosyphilis). For suspected syphilis infection of the end-organs, especially in acute presentations, urgent consultation with a specialist is recommended. Refer individuals with suspected or proven tertiary syphilis.

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 3](#c0099n00026) illustrates the management of genital ulcers (herpes, lymphogranuloma venereum and syphilis).

### Pharmacologic Choices

After treatment for syphilis (see [Table 8](#c0099n00394)), follow patients serologically for treatment response and to monitor for possible treatment failure. For LGV (see [Table 9](#c0099n00418)), test of cure is performed 3–4 weeks after completion of treatment.

Azithromycin is no longer a recommended treatment for syphilis due to reported treatment failures and developing resistance patterns.​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[26]](#c0099n00436)

. . . . .

### Management of Anogenital Warts

### Etiology

Approximately 90% of anogenital warts are caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Diagnosis is usually clinical, but a referral to a specialist (with a possible biopsy of lesions) may be useful when the diagnosis is uncertain. A biopsy may be particularly relevant in the cervix or anal canal, as lesions in these areas are more likely to have an unusual appearance. Refer patients with warts on their cervix to a gynecologist. Anal HPV lesions can often be managed with cryotherapy via an anoscope; if this is not possible, referral to a proctologist or surgeon may be indicated.

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 4](#c0099n00002) illustrates the management of anogenital warts.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Since anogenital warts may resolve spontaneously, observation alone may be appropriate; however, there is a frustratingly high recurrence rate (approximately 33%) 1 year after apparent cure. No definitive evidence suggests any of the available treatments is superior to the others, and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. Low-quality evidence suggests that topical imiquimod is effective therapy for external anogenital warts​[[27]](#c0099n00710) and is considered first-line patient-applied treatment (see [Table 10](#c0099n00500)). Imiquimod may achieve complete or partial regression of existing warts, but it is not known whether it affects the rate of wart recurrence.​[[27]](#c0099n00710) Imiquimod may be as effective as some practitioner-administered treatments (e.g., chemical ablation, cryotherapy) in clearing warts.​[[27]](#c0099n00710) The sinecatechins are a botanical extract derived from green tea, which can be applied topically by patients for the treatment of anogenital warts. Sinecatechins may achieve complete clearance of lesions in >50% of individuals and <10% may experience recurrences. Application site reactions similar to those associated with imiquimod (e.g., erythema, pain, ulceration) occur with the application of sinecatechins in the majority of individuals.​[[28]](#TattiSSwinehartJMThielertCTawfikHMe-BCBC95A5)​[[29]](#StockflethEBetiHOrasanRGrigorianFMe-BCBCB028)

A vaccine is available for prevention of anogenital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. The 9-valent HPV vaccine protects against infection and associated diseases caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. In addition to anogenital warts, the vaccine protects against cancer and precancerous or dysplastic lesions of the cervix, vulva, vagina and anus caused by the HPV types included in the vaccine. The 9-valent HPV vaccine has been approved for patients 9–45 years of age (see [Table 11](#c0099n00501)).​[[32]](#refitem-1312119-B4D79D12)​[[33]](#Gardasil9Monograph) A bivalent HPV vaccine is available that protects against infection and associated diseases caused by HPV types 16 and 18; it does not prevent anogenital warts.

. . . . .

### Management of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

### Therapeutic Choices

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) includes infectious endometritis, salpingitis and peritonitis. Patients with PID should be hospitalized if they are pregnant, do not respond to or do not tolerate outpatient antibiotics, are nonadherent, have a tubo-ovarian abscess or are ill (e.g., vomiting, high fever).​[[5]](#c0099n00037)​[[6]](#c0099n00038) Test and treat sexual partners (see [Table 2](#table-11332-999F0A7A)). [Figure 5](#c0099n00021) illustrates the management of PID. [Table 12](#c0099n00035) and [Table 13](#c0099n00347) detail the antibiotics used in the management of PID in outpatients and inpatients, respectively.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for PID should include coverage of the likely pathogens: N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, gram-negative facultative bacteria and streptococci. Consider anaerobic coverage since anaerobes are detected in the majority of PID cases. However, it is not known if elimination of anaerobes is necessary.

. . . . .

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

STIs pose potential risk of complications for the expectant parent and the newborn. Therefore, screen pregnant patients for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and hepatitis B virus, and offer HIV testing in their first prenatal visit and again in the third trimester if their risk of acquiring an STI is ongoing. Due to increased risks of complications and the potential for decreased efficacy of treatments during pregnancy, follow-up is important to ensure therapeutic success. Consult experts when appropriate. Erythromycin estolate salt, fluoroquinolones, podophyllin, imiquimod and tetracyclines are relatively or absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Several STIs may cause poor pregnancy outcomes, be vertically transmitted and cause congenital infections. Always seek up-to-date information.

Untreated trichomoniasis may lead to premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery and low birth weight. Symptomatic patients should be treated. Testing and treating asymptomatic pregnant patients is controversial, with experts divided over risks versus benefits. The 2005 study upon which the recommendation against treating these patients was based is now considered to be flawed​[[8]](#refitem-134215-BDA5A1DF) and subsequent studies have not demonstrated any negative treatment outcomes.​[[9]](#refitem-134216-BDA5A3D4)​[[10]](#refitem-134217-BDA5A55C)​[[11]](#refitem-134218-BDA5A75B) The preferred treatment is oral metronidazole (see [Table 3](#c0099n00307)). Sexual partners should be treated.

Untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, preterm birth and postpartum endometritis. Screen if pregnancy is high risk (previous preterm labour/delivery or premature rupture of membranes) or if patient is symptomatic. Otherwise, treatment has not been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes.​[[7]](#c0099n00538) Systemic metronidazole or clindamycin are preferred over topical formulations (see [Table 4](#c0099n00308)). It’s unnecessary to withhold breastfeeding during treatment with metronidazole, but some clinicians advise against breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after a 2 g dose.​[[12]](#CanPedSoc2006) Consider re-screening high-risk patients.

Routine screening for vulvovaginal candidiasis is not necessary. Risks to pregnant patients are limited to bothersome symptoms and irritation. Recurrences are common in pregnancy. If symptomatic, treat with topical **azole** antifungals (see [Table 5](#c0099n00198)). Although some evidence suggests an association between oral fluconazole use during pregnancy (including 150 mg single dose) and miscarriage,​[[36]](#Berard2019) the data are insufficient to establish a causal relationship; single-dose oral fluconazole may be used as a second-line option in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.​[[37]](#MolgaardNielsen2013) Higher doses (>150 mg) of oral fluconazole during the first trimester are potentially teratogenic.​[[38]](#LopezRangel2005)​[[39]](#Alsaad2015) Oral fluconazole should therefore be avoided during pregnancy where possible​[[40]](#SOGCFluconazole) (see Drugs Use during Pregnancy). Boric acid vaginal suppositories are not recommended in pregnancy.

Untreated chlamydial infections may lead to preterm birth, and premature rupture of membranes and may cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia in the newborn. Screen all pregnant patients at first prenatal visit. Azithromycin is the preferred antibiotic; amoxicillin can also be used (see [Table 6](#c0099n00200)). Patients should abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after initiation of adequate treatment and until all sexual partners have been treated. Patients and ongoing sexual partners should have a follow-up test of cure 3–4 weeks after completing therapy.

Untreated gonococcal infections may lead to endometritis and pelvic sepsis in the patient and ophthalmia neonatorum and systemic infection in the newborn. Screen all pregnant patients at first prenatal visit. Ceftriaxone is the preferred antibiotic (see [Table 7](#c0099n00199)). Patients should abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after initiation of adequate treatment and until all sexual partners have been treated. Patients and ongoing sexual partners should have a follow-up test of cure 3–4 weeks after completing therapy. Always treat for chlamydia in confirmed gonococcal infections.

Untreated syphilis infection may lead to complications of systemic syphilis in the patient and congenital syphilis in the newborn. Fetal loss may also occur. Transmission during breastfeeding is theoretically possible during secondary syphilis. A **penicillin** regime is the only consistently effective treatment (see [Table 8](#c0099n00394)). Refer to a specialist for penicillin desensitization if patient is allergic to penicillin. Risk of vertical transmission is significantly reduced with maternal therapy, but empiric therapy may be required for the newborn with appropriate follow-up to rule out congenital syphilis, e.g., if patient was treated <4 weeks prior to delivery.

Anogenital warts and HPV infections may proliferate during pregnancy and may be refractory to therapy. Respiratory papillomatosis may occur rarely in the newborn. Goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms only. Disease severity may increase in pregnancy and may spontaneously regress postpartum. Trichloroacetic acid (see [Table 10](#c0099n00500)), cryotherapy, and laser or surgical excision are the preferred treatment options. Cytotoxic agents (podophyllin and imiquimod) are contraindicated. There is no available evidence on the use of sinecatechins in pregnancy and thus their use cannot be recommended. Cesarean section is rarely indicated.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is uncommon in pregnancy but poses an increased risk of adverse outcomes for both the patient and the fetus. Suspected PID cases should be hospitalized for evaluation and treatment with parenteral therapy (see [Table 13](#c0099n00347)). Outpatient regimens recommended for the treatment of PID are outlined in [Table 12](#c0099n00035). Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Treat sexual contacts (see [Table 2](#table-11332-999F0A7A)).
- Discuss and counsel on risk of acquisition and transmission of STIs.​[[46]](#c0099n00443)
- Discuss and counsel on risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV,​[[46]](#c0099n00443) including the role of PrEP and nPEP (see HIV Infection: Prevention).
- Discuss consistent and correct use of latex or polyurethane condoms for optimal risk reduction of STIs.​[[41]](#c0099n00438)​[[42]](#c0099n00440)​[[43]](#c0099n00442)​[[44]](#c0099n00441)​[[45]](#c0099n00439)
- Recommend HPV vaccine to all patients <26 years of age; consider benefits for patients >26 years of age.​[[32]](#refitem-1312119-B4D79D12)
- Recommend Hepatitis A vaccine to patients who may benefit.
- Recommend Hepatitis B vaccine, if not previously immunized.

Although Canadian STI guidelines list cefixime (in combination with azithromycin) as an alternative treatment for pharyngeal infections, studies show cefixime may be comparable to ceftriaxone for this indication when combined with azithromycin.​ [18] ​ [19] However, local AMR patterns should be considered when considering cefixime as a preferred treatment. Repeat screening recommended. |
| ceftriaxone generics <$5 | Adults and children ≥9 y: 250 mg IM × single dose + azithromycin 1 g PO × single dose Children <9 y: 50 mg/kg IM × single dose; maximum 250 mg + azithromycin 20 mg/kg PO × single dose; maximum 1 g | GI upset, hypersensitivity reactions. | Preferred regimen . Canadian STI guidelines list ceftriaxone (in combination with azithromycin) as a preferred treatment for pharyngeal infections. In 2020 the CDC revised its guidelines for gonococcal infection as a result of changing AMR patterns; the recommendation is now a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg IM without azithromycin.​ [17] May be mixed with 1–2 mL of 1% lidocaine to reduce pain from injection. Do not reconstitute or mix with calcium-containing solutions. Do not administer simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions via a Y-site. Administration may be done sequentially provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions. |

**Drug Class: Macrolides**

| azithromycin Zithromax , generics $5–10 | Combination therapy with cephalosporins; adults and children ≥9 y: 1 g PO × single dose children <9 y: 20 mg/kg PO × single dose; maximum 1 g Combination therapy with gentamicin; adults and children ≥9 y: 2 g PO × single dose | GI upset, QT-prolongation (rare). | Component of preferred regimen (with cefixime or ceftriaxone) . In 2020 the CDC revised its guidelines for gonococcal infection as a result of changing AMR patterns; the recommendation is now a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg IM without azithromycin.​ [17] Component of alternative regimen (with gentamicin) for treatment of anogenital infections in patients with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea or a history of anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or allergy to cephalosporins. Bacterial resistance to azithromycin has emerged sporadically in Canada and appears to be increasing in certain jurisdictions; azithromycin should not be used as monotherapy.​ [5] Prophylactic antiemetics may be needed. 2 g dose will also treat chlamydia infection. |

**Drug Class: Tetracyclines**

| doxycycline generics $5–10 | Combination therapy with gentamicin; adults and children ≥9 y: 100 mg BID PO × 7 days | GI upset, rash, candidal vaginitis, photosensitivity. | Component of alternative regimen (with gentamicin) for treatment of anogenital infections in patients with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea or a history of anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or allergy to cephalosporins, AND macrolide-resistant infection or a history of anaphylactic reaction to macrolides.

**Drug Class: Aminoglycosides**

| gentamicin generics ~$55 | Adults and children ≥9 y with contraindications to cephalosporins: 240 mg IM in 2 separate 3 mL injections of 40 mg/mL solution + azithromycin 2 g PO × single dose Adults and children ≥9 y with contraindications to cephalosporins and macrolides: 240 mg IM in 2 separate 3 mL injections of 40 mg/mL solution + doxycycline 100 mg BID PO × 7 days | Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity (monitor kidney function and gentamicin levels during treatment). | Component of alternative regimen (with azithromycin or doxycycline) . Contraindications to cephalosporins include cephalosporin-resistant infection, or a history of anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or allergy to cephalosporins. Contraindications to macrolides include macrolide-resistant infection or a history of anaphylactic reaction to macrolides. 240 mg IV infused over 30 min may be considered as an alternative if IM route is not feasible. |

[[a]](#fnsrc_drufnad1028249e3100) Initiate empiric chlamydia therapy in all patients regardless of chlamydia test result, as co-infection rates are high and chlamydia has a longer test window period. See [Table 6](#c0099n00200) for cotreatment of chlamydia infection. Treat sexual partners.
