| Fungal Infections, nails See also . | See Comments |  | See Comments |  | No nonprescription therapy of choice.​ [a] Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Fungal Infections, skin See also Fungal Skin Infections . | clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin (topical) See Comments |  | clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin (topical) |  | Though these topical antifungal agents are considered safe, further assessment is recommended to identify potential pregnancy-specific dermatologic conditions. |
| Fungal Infections, vaginal See also Vaginal Symptoms, Hygiene and Infections . | clotrimazole (topical, vaginal) miconazole (topical, vaginal)​ [56] ​ [57] ​ [58] |  | clotrimazole (topical, vaginal) miconazole (topical, vaginal)​ [59] | fluconazole 150 mg single dose | Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment if symptoms persevere after nonprescription treatment. |

| Hemorrhoids See also Hemorrhoids , Prenatal and Postpartum Care . | Bulk-forming agents: psyllium, bran Stool softeners: docusate Topical: zinc oxide | See Comments | Bulk-forming agents: psyllium, bran Stool softeners: docusate Topical: zinc oxide | See Comments | No safety data available for nonprescription topical hemorrhoid products; however, because of the small doses and limited systemic absorption, they can be safely used for symptom relief if bulk-forming agents and stool softeners are inadequate. |
| Influenza See also Influenza . | See Comments |  | See Comments |  | Treat symptoms and hydration as necessary; see individual symptoms. |
| Insect Bites and Stings See also Insect Bites and Stings . | Treatment with ice may be sufficient | diphenhydramine (oral or topical), Nonprescription topical corticosteroids | Treatment with ice may be sufficient | diphenhydramine (oral or topical), Nonprescription topical corticosteroids | Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment if symptoms are severe or do not resolve within 7 days. Topical diphenhydramine can cause allergic contact dermatitis. |
| Insect Repellents See also Insect Bites and Stings . | DEET, icaridin See Comments |  | DEET, icaridin See Comments |  | Pregnant patients should avoid travel to Zika-affected areas and use insect repellent to protect themselves from mosquito bites, as Zika infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects in the fetus.​ [60] ​ [61] P-menthane 3,8-diol (PMD/oil of lemon eucalyptus) and soybean oil are also considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding​ [61] but duration of effect is shorter than for some strengths of DEET and icaridin.​ [62] |
| Lice See also Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies . | permethrins,​ [63] ​ [64] pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide |  | permethrins, pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide See Comments |  | These products have not been studied in lactation; however, systemic absorption is expected to be negligible. |

There may be a risk of decreased milk production with pseudoephedrine in patients whose lactation is not well established or who have low milk supply. |
| Nausea and Vomiting See also Nausea and Vomiting and Prenatal and Postpartum Care . | doxylamine/pyridoxine​ [72] | dimenhydrinate​ [19] ​ [73] ​ [74] ​ [75] | dimenhydrinate |  | Doxylamine 10 mg/pyridoxine 10 mg (delayed-release combination product) is available on prescription. |

Avoid NSAIDs and full doses of ASA in third trimester. Limit codeine to short-term use in pregnancy. Codeine should be avoided in breastfeeding as safer effective treatments are available. If codeine is used, limit to <4 days’ duration and discontinue if either patient or infant displays signs of toxicity.​ [49] ​ [50] Patient requires further assessment as bacterial infection may require prescription treatment. |
| Pigmentary Changes (chloasma, melasma) See also Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage . |  | hydroquinone See Comments |  | hydroquinone See Comments | Minimal human data do not suggest teratogenic risk;​ [65] however, as treatment is cosmetic only, use should be avoided. Systemic absorption does occur.​ [66] Sunscreen use can help to prevent or minimize pigmentary changes. |
| Pinworms See also Pinworms . | See Comments |  | See Comments |  | Published safety data exist only for prescription agents and therefore they are preferred for this indication. However, there are no published reports of adverse outcomes in pregnancy or breastfeeding associated with pyrantel pamoate. |
| Reflux Esophagitis See also Dyspepsia and GERD and Prenatal and Postpartum Care . | alginic acid compounds, aluminum, calcium and magnesium antacids, famotidine, esomeprazole, omeprazole​ [76] ​ [77] ​ [78] ranitidine |  | alginic acid compounds, aluminum, calcium and magnesium antacids, famotidine, esomeprazole, omeprazole,​ [79] ranitidine |  |  |
| Rhinorrhea See also Allergic Rhinitis , and Prenatal and Postpartum Care . | First-generation antihistamines: brompheniramine,​ [15] chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, diphenhydramine, pheniramine​ [16] ​ [17] ​ [18] ​ [19] Intranasal corticosteroids: fluticasone,​ [13] ​ [20] ​ [21] ​ [22] ​ [24] triamcinolone​ [24] ​ [25] ​ [26] | Intranasal corticosteroids: mometasone | First-generation antihistamines​ [30] ​ [31] ​ [32] ​ [33] Intranasal corticosteroids: fluticasone, mometasone, triamcinolone See Comments |  | Intranasal corticosteroids have not been studied in lactation; however, systemic absorption is expected to be negligible and unlikely to affect a breastfed infant. |
| Scabies See also Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies . | permethrins​ [63] ​ [64] |  | permethrins |  | Not studied in lactation; however, systemic absorption is expected to be negligible. |
| Smoking Cessation See also Smoking Cessation . | nicotine replacement (patch, gum, inhaler) |  | nicotine replacement (patch, gum, inhaler) |  | Nicotine replacement has not been well studied in pregnancy or lactation but would provide less toxin exposure for the patient than cigarette smoke. The addition of counselling may improve cessation success rate. |
| Viral Rhinitis See also Viral Rhinitis . | See Nasal Congestion See Rhinorrhea |  |  |  |  |
| Warts, common or plantar See also Plantar Warts and Viral Skin Infections: Common and Flat Warts . | salicylic acid preparations​ [18] ​ [37] ​ [38] ​ [39] ​ [40] ​ [41] ​ [42] ​ [43] ​ [44] ​ [45] |  | salicylic acid preparations |  | Avoid salicylates in the third trimester. |

[a] For many conditions, only prescription treatments have been studied. This does not mean that nonprescription therapy is unsafe, but there is no evidence available on which to base a recommendation at this time.
