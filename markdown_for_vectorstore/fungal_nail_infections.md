### Introduction

Onychomycosis (OM) is a fungal nail infection that most often affects the feet, particularly the great toenail. In some patients, it can cause discomfort, pain and disfigurement, which may result in functional and occupational limitations that impact quality of life. It rarely remits spontaneously, requires prolonged treatment, and can progress to affect other nails or skin areas. Recurrence and reinfection are common; it has been reported that recurrence occurs in 10–53% of cases while reinfection (relapse after an initially successful treatment) occurs in 20–25% of cases. OM may also spread to close family members.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)

The nail is a specialized outgrowth of skin that protects fingers and toes from injury. The visible hard nail (nail plate) grows from a small area located in the half-moon white region (nail matrix) near the cuticle (see [Figure 1](#AnatomyToenail)). The nail plate grows toward the tip of the toe or finger and is attached longitudinally to the nail bed. Fungal invasion of the nail matrix can drastically change the appearance of the nail (see [Photo 1](#OMPhoto)).​[[2]](#Chakraborty-36EF5548)

In patients with diabetes or immunosuppression, if the infection progresses to affect other nails or skin areas, these infected areas can serve as a reservoir of fungi that may cause reinfection or serve as a portal of entry for bacteria, leading to secondary bacterial infections such as cellulitis.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)

### Pathophysiology

OM of the toenail affects about 6.7% of the Canadian population, with increasing prevalence (up to 25%) in older individuals.​[[4]](#refitem-114214-758436F5) It is more common in persons with other nail problems (e.g., psoriasis or trauma), peripheral vascular insufficiency, hyperhidrosis, immunosuppressed states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection or immunosuppressive medications) and those who frequently use public swimming pools or who are in occupations requiring occlusive footwear.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[6]](#c0125n1007)​[[7]](#refitem-1142121-77FE5E30) In one-third of cases, there is an association with the presence of tinea pedis (athlete’s foot; see Athlete's Foot) where the infection can serve as a reservoir of fungi and as a portal of entry for bacteria.​[[8]](#c0125n1003)​[[9]](#c0125n1005) Secondary bacterial infections and cellulitis may occur in patients with diabetes.​[[10]](#c0125n1004)

Onychomycosis is caused primarily by dermatophytes (>60–70%;​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847) e.g., Epidermophyton, Microsporum and Trichophyton species) and occasionally by yeasts (10–20%, e.g., Candida albicans) or nondermatophyte moulds (10–20%; e.g., Scopulariopsis, Aspergillus and Fusarium species).​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[11]](#Lipne-36F6B568) Tinea unguium occurs when dermatophytes are the specific cause of the nail infection; the usual causative dermatophyte is T. rubrum. Occasionally, other dermatophytes such as T. mentagrophytes var. *interdigitale* and E. floccosum are involved.​[[12]](#refitem-114219-7B9B0B2F)​[[13]](#c0125n1025)

There are 5 major subtypes of OM:​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[11]](#Lipne-36F6B568)

- Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) is the most common form of OM; it is characterized by nail thickening and separation (onycholysis) of the nail plate from the nail bed. The nail may present with a white-yellowish or brownish discoloration and the nail may crumble on the outward corners.
- Superficial white onychomycosis (SWO) is less common than DLSO; it is characterized by chalky, white patches on the top surface of the nail plate that can be scraped away. The dermatophyte invades the nail plate directly from above and does not generally involve the nail bed; however, the entire nail plate can be involved, where the nail becomes roughened and crumbly.
- Proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO) is rare and is characterized by white discoloration at the proximal nail fold (i.e., the cuticle) beneath the nail bed. The infecting dermatophyte enters through the proximal nail fold and penetrates the newly formed nail plate, then migrates distally. It is most common in immunosuppressed patients and can be a marker for AIDS.
- Endonyx onychomycosis (EO) is rare and is characterized as a milky patch of the nail with indentations and some splitting of the nail. EO is an infection of the nail plate but not the nail bed; thus, the nail plate does not separate from the nail bed.
- Total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) is rare and is characterized by the crumbling of the nail plate that is yellow in colour and thick. TDO is the total destruction of the nail and may follow other subtypes.

### Risk Factors

Risk factors for OM include:​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[14]](#Bodman2024)

- ≥18 years of age (especially those ≥65 years of age)
- Occlusive or tight-fitting footwear
- Use of public showers or pool decks, or repeated exposure to water
- Concurrent foot condition (e.g., tinea pedis, nail trauma, poor nail care, bunions) or a history of onychomycosis
- Concurrent dermatologic condition, e.g., hyperhidrosis, psoriasis
- Concurrent medical condition, e.g., diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hyperthyroidism, immunodeficiency (e.g., immune deficiency syndrome, transplant patients); OM is up to 3 times more prevalent in patients with diabetes, especially in those ≥65 years of age​[[6]](#c0125n1007)
- Lifestyle factors: smoking, obesity
- Household contact of individual with a fungal infection

### Goals of Therapy

- Eradicate causative organism and achieve mycological cure
- Improve appearance of nail
- Prevent spread and recurrences of fungal infection
- Prevent complications such as secondary bacterial infections, e.g., cellulitis

### Assessment

The diagnosis of OM should include a physical exam to determine which nails are affected, if there are other foot conditions that may contribute to the infection, and the presence or absence of any nail trauma. Toenail involvement is more common than fingernails, but both can occur. The great or second toe are most often affected, and examination for discoloration, white streaks, patches and thickening or crumbling of the nail plate should be investigated. Diseases mimicking OM are listed in [Table 1](#c0125n00005).​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[15]](#Lim-3B9352F9)

OM severity is important as it informs which therapeutic approach to take (i.e., topical or systemic); it can be determined by multiplying the area of nail involvement (range: 0–5) by the proximity of the infection to the nail matrix (range: 1–5) plus 10 points if there are nail streaks or >2 mm of hyperkeratosis. Mild nail involvement is diagnosed if total equals 0–5 points, moderate if total equals 6–15 points and severe if total equals 16–35 points.​[[16]](#Queller-3B93FC48)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5)

It is essential to confirm the diagnosis with further testing in order to determine the optimal treatment for the infection. Fungal nail infections are most commonly diagnosed as follows:​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[15]](#Lim-3B9352F9)​[[18]](#Falotico-3B93404D)

- Direct microscopy: scrapings from the nail bed are dissolved in potassium hydroxide [KOH] then examined under a microscope. This technique is inexpensive with quick, in-office results (15–60 min) but has low sensitivity (i.e., high rate of false-negative results).
- Histopathology: nail tissue/clippings are treated with staining medium (e.g., haematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff) then examined by a dermatopathologist. This method can differentiate between other nail infections and is the most sensitive technique completed in a laboratory; however, it is expensive and it cannot determine OM subtypes.
- Fungal culture: nail tissue/clippings are grown in a laboratory in agar. This method can identify the OM subtype and has a high accuracy rate; however, results take 3–4 weeks and it has low sensitivity (many false-negative results).
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): can identify the OM subtype, takes <48 hours and has a high sensitivity; however, it has low specificity (i.e., high rate of false-positive results) and is very expensive.
- Nail dermoscopy (also known as onychoscopy): can be done in the office and is helpful in ruling out nonfungal causes. It is noninvasive, inexpensive, has rapid results and helps to differentiate OM from other nail conditions (e.g., traumatic onycholysis, melanonychia, nail psoriasis).

The current standard for diagnosis is a combination of fungal culture and KOH microscopy; fungal filaments or hyphae may be seen by examining scrapings from the infected nail plate. If KOH microscopy is positive but culture is negative, it is recommended that the nail culture be repeated, as culture has a high rate of false-negatives.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[19]](#Gupta2017-3B936E43)

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnoses of Fungal Nail Infections​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)[[15]](#Lim-3B9352F9)

| Differential Diagnoses to Consider | Clinical Features |
| --- | --- |
| Lichen planus of the nail | Vertical groove and ridges, progressive nail thinning and atrophy. Can also affect the cuticles, skin (itchy papules), oral mucosa and genitals.​ [17] ​ [20] |
| Malignant melanoma affecting the nail matrix or nail bed | Vertical pigmented bands form in the nail matrix (nail matrix melanoma) or red, brown or black nodule forms under the nail plate with ulceration and bleeding (subungual melanoma). |
| Onychocryptosis (ingrown nail) | Nail plate curls into the cuticle, leading to inflammation, discomfort and infection. Can occur secondary to nail trauma, improperly fitting shoes or incorrect nail trimming. |
| Onychogryphosis | Thickened, yellow/brown, curved nail (claw-like) often seen in older adults with vascular insufficiency.​ [21] |
| Onycholoysis | Separation of the nail plate from the nail bed. Can occur secondary to nail trauma, underlying tumor, phototoxicity, contact dermatitis, nail psoriasis or nail lichen planus. |
| Onychomadesis | Complete separation and shedding of the nail plate from the nail bed. Can occur secondary to infections (e.g., hand-foot-and-mouth disease, varicella), nail trauma, chemotherapy, lichen planus, Kawasaki disease. Risk factor for developing onychomycosis. |
| Psoriasis of the nail | Symmetrical nail involvement; nail pitting, onycholysis, white debris overlying the nail bed (subungual hyperkeratosis), brown/red or pink patches or spots on the nail, nail crumbling, white lines on the nail plate. Associated with psoriatic arthritis.​ [17] ​ [22] |
| Squamous cell carcinoma of the nail | Most common malignant nail disorder; appears as nail bed erosion, ulcerations, discharge, bleeding and nail loss. Risk factors include immunosuppression, chronic sun exposure, human papillomavirus and nail trauma. |
| Trachyonychia | Inflammatory nail disease. Nail plate appears rough and brittle with red/dark coloration and vertical ridging; nail plate may split. Can occur secondary to alopecia areata or nail psoriasis. |
| Yellow nail syndrome | Nails grow slowly, are yellow-green and thick and curved. Associated with defective lymphatic drainage in lungs causing pulmonary infections.​ [23] |

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 2](#c0125n00017) illustrates an approach to the treatment of OM. Consider treatment in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, prior cellulitis, venous insufficiency, nail pain or in those who wish to improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected nails.​[[24]](#MedLetter2021) Management options for OM include topical antifungal agents, systemic antifungal agents and/or 1 (or more) of the following:​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)

- Keratolytic agents (e.g., urea, salicylic acid, lactic acid): used in combination with topical agents to soften the nail, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the topical antifungal.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[19]](#Gupta2017-3B936E43)
- Devices: iontophoresis, nail drilling (i.e., mechanical débridement) and ultrasound have been investigated to aid in drug delivery (by increasing nail permeability) while photodynamic, laser, microwave and nonthermal plasma therapy have been investigated as potential antifungal treatments. There is no advantage to using these devices over oral or topical agents, as they have limited evidence and require further study.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[19]](#Gupta2017-3B936E43)​[[25]](#Gupta2023)
- Surgical nail removal (partial or total nail avulsion): generally discouraged, as it is painful and the new nail may become ingrown or reinfected. It is especially dangerous in patients with diabetes, as it increases their risk of infection and gangrene.​[[19]](#Gupta2017-3B936E43)

For patients with superficial white onychomycosis (SWO), mechanical débridement or scraping of the nail helps topical agents reach infected areas more effectively.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)

Inform patients that nail improvement will continue for months after the course of oral drug therapy is completed; fingernails take about 6 months to grow out, while toenails take about 12 months. Relapse and reinfection are common, and are likely to occur within 30 months of treatment with oral agents.​[[26]](#Gupta2021)

Persons with OM and their family members should be treated for any associated tinea pedis (see Athlete's Foot).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nondrug strategies to prevent or minimize relapse of OM and/or tinea pedis (see Athlete's Foot) include educating the patient on monitoring for reinfection and advising them to do the following:​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[24]](#MedLetter2021)​[[26]](#Gupta2021)​[[27]](#refitem-1142133-78063F90)

- Wear footwear and socks that minimize humidity, e.g., moisture-absorbent socks
- Dry feet and interdigital spaces thoroughly after washing
- Use footwear to avoid fungal transmission from shared public spaces (i.e., avoid being barefoot) such as swimming pools, nail salons, etc.
- Keep nails clean and cut short to avoid nail trauma
- Avoid sharing nail clippers, towels, sheets, blankets or footwear
- Wash affected clothing separately and at high temperatures
- Prevent further trauma to toenails; wearing nonrestrictive footwear or fitted orthotics may be helpful
- Discard old, infected footwear (prevents fungus from reinfecting) or disinfect footwear and socks before wearing again
- Wear rubber gloves to protect fingernails if hands are immersed in water for long periods of time
- Apply emollients on cracked skin to reduce further entry points for fungus
- Control chronic health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease

### Pharmacologic Choices

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Skin Care Products: Antifungals.

Topical and systemic agents used in the management of OM are described in [Table 3](#c0125n00024). Treatment methods take into consideration the severity of the infection, patient preference (cost, length of treatment required), comorbidities, potential for drug-drug interactions and adverse reactions.​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5) Systemic antifungal agents have been traditionally the first choice in treating moderate to severe infections, as they have a higher success rate than topical antifungals. However, topical antifungals are considered when treating mild to moderate infections, as they have fewer side effects compared with systemic agents. The combination of oral and topical products can be used in patients ≥65 years of age, those with comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immunocompromised patients) or in those who have failed monotherapy.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[11]](#Lipne-36F6B568)

Treatment efficacy is demonstrated by either clinical cure or mycological cure rates. A mycological cure is indicated by results of potassium hydroxide/culture. Periodic acid–Schiff staining of a histological nail biopsy may be inaccurate because the viability of fungal organisms cannot be determined.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB) In terms of patient expectations, the clinical cure rate is the measure of interest as it corresponds with the appearance of the nail.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)

### Topical Therapy

Topical therapies are considered for initial treatment of mild to moderate OM (<50% of the nail plate affected, nail plate thickness <2 mm and no nail bed involvement).​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[24]](#MedLetter2021) Topical agents are beneficial for mild to moderate onychomycosis and are characterized by weak systemic absorption, no drug interactions, few adverse effects and good tolerability. However, they are less effective than systemic agents, and evidence suggests that cure rates are poor when compared with placebo.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[28]](#Aggarwal2020) Although evidence is lacking, filing the upper surface of the thickened nail (vigorous débridement) may increase the extent of penetration for a topical preparation and thereby increase the likelihood for successful topical therapy.​[[29]](#c0125n1012) Recurrence of infection is common upon discontinuation of topical treatment;​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[30]](#Axler2024) for information on treatment of recurrence, see [Relapse and Reinfection](#Recurrence) and [Figure 2](#c0125n00017).

Ciclopirox **olamine 8%** lacquer monotherapy, a synthetic hydroxypyridone antifungal, when applied to nails once daily for 24 weeks for fingernails or 48 weeks for toenails, demonstrates only a 5.5% and 6–9% clinical cure rate for finger- and toenails, respectively.​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5) Efficacy has been demonstrated with daily application as well as weekly removal of lacquer residue with acetone and débridement/trimming damaged or diseased parts of the affected nails.​[[28]](#Aggarwal2020)​[[30]](#Axler2024) However, this regimen may be difficult to adhere to, particularly if the patient is older or has poor vision.​[[31]](#Crawford2007) Combining ciclopirox 8% lacquer with oral terbinafine has not been shown to be more effective than terbinafine monotherapy. Side effects include local skin irritation and temporary nail changes.​[[30]](#Axler2024)

Efinaconazole **10%** topical nail solution is a triazole antifungal indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate toenail OM; there are few studies evaluating its effectiveness for fingernail OM. It is applied to the affected nail(s) once daily for 48 weeks.​[[28]](#Aggarwal2020)​[[30]](#Axler2024) No débridement is necessary due to enhanced penetration of the formulation. Removal of previously applied solution is not required as there is no buildup from daily application. Clinical cure rates of 15–17% and mycological cure rates of 54% have been demonstrated; generally more patients with mild OM achieve a complete cure than patients with moderate OM.​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5)​[[32]](#Issa2023)

A nonprescription, topical solution containing propylene glycol-urea-lactic acid is available for once-daily application in the treatment of mild DLSO. The solution has an antifungal action through the disruption of the integrity of the cell wall of *T. rubrum*.​[[33]](#refitem-1172128-8AA6BD4C) In one study, it markedly improved the visible appearance of the affected nail when used for 24 weeks and had a mycological cure rate of 27.2%.​[[34]](#refitem-1142155-7C1BCE14) Adverse effects include occasional pain and irritation at the site of application, onycholysis and a frequent occurrence (>10%) of nail whitening and opacity.

Tavaborole is an oxaborole antifungal approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate OM; however, it is not currently available in Canada.​[[24]](#MedLetter2021)

### Systemic Therapy

Oral agents for OM treatment include the allylamine antifungal terbinafine and the azole antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole). Oral terbinafine and itraconazole are commonly used in the treatment of OM with varying results on which is more effective.​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5)​[[30]](#Axler2024) Itraconazole may be preferred over terbinafine in treating OM caused by yeasts or nondermatophyte moulds as it is broad spectrum.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[30]](#Axler2024) Pulsed versus continuous therapy of terbinafine and itraconazole have been studied; some studies have shown continuous therapy to be more effective while others have not shown statistically significant differences.​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[35]](#Bermudez2023) Terbinafine is about twice as effective as pulsed itraconazole in achieving complete cure (i.e., negative mycological analysis and visually normal nail; 35–78% vs. 14–43%) after 6 weeks of treatment for fingernails and 12 weeks for toenails.​[[35]](#Bermudez2023) There is minimal difference in recurrence rates between terbinafine and azole antifungals.​[[36]](#refitem-1142125-78018BE1)

Fluconazole has relatively reduced efficacy and subsequently is not officially indicated for treatment of OM; it may be considered off-label as an alternative therapy if there is intolerance to the other agents.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5)​[[30]](#Axler2024)

Ketoconazole is not recommended to treat OM due to lack of supportive data and risk of hepatotoxicity.​[[28]](#Aggarwal2020)​[[36]](#refitem-1142125-78018BE1)

Oral fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine are associated with a low incidence of adverse events when used to treat OM.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5) Most common adverse effects include mild and transient headache, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain), viral infections or skin rashes.​[[1]](#Gupta-36ED6DE9)​[[5]](#Yousefian-36F014BB)​[[17]](#Frazier2021-3B9421D5)​[[36]](#refitem-1142125-78018BE1) Hepatoxicity is a concern in some patients and baseline lab monitoring should be done prior to prescribing oral antifungals in those patients with high risk of impairment. Patients >65 years of age and those with pre-existing liver conditions may benefit from liver function monitoring throughout treatment.​[[37]](#Wang-8AE6EDD1)​[[38]](#Gupta2023Safety)​[[39]](#Nenoff2023)

For information related to treatment failure, relapse, recurrence or reinfection, see [Relapse and Reinfection](#Recurrence).

### Chemical or Surgical Avulsion

Keratolytics (urea, salicylic acid, lactic acid and papain) have been used to soften the nail and improve efficacy of topical agents. Nail abrasion, trimming, nail avulsion (partial or full removal of the nail) or débridement (partial removal) can be used to improve the absorption of topical antifungal agents.​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847) Risks associated with nail avulsion include pain, possible wound infection and scarring.

### Device-Based Therapy

Device-based therapeutic options (e.g., photodynamic therapy, iontophoresis and laser therapy) have been investigated for the treatment of OM as an alternative to current pharmacological options. Although there is some preliminary evidence of clinical improvement, further evaluation and larger well-designed studies are needed to determine their long-term efficacy and place in therapy:​[[3]](#Leung-36F01847)​[[25]](#Gupta2023)​[[35]](#Bermudez2023)

- Nail drilling: also known as mechanical débridement; studies have indicated that it could improve absorption of topical agents into the nail plate.
- Photodynamic therapy (PDT): studies have shown that PDT can be used in combination with oral agents to shorten treatment duration and improve cure rate; however, larger studies are required to confirm efficacy.
- Iontophoresis: studies have indicated that it could improve absorption of topical agents into the nail plate.
- Laser therapy: some studies have indicated that laser treatments may be beneficial in patients not able to use oral agents or in combination treatments.

### Relapse and Reinfection

Treatment failure may be due to misdiagnosis, poor adherence or drug resistance. In order to avoid relapse/reinfection and possible antifungal resistance, ensure there is a definite diagnosis of OM prior to treatment, encourage adherence to treatment regimen and ensure nonpharmacological measures are followed.​[[40]](#Gupta2024Resistance)​[[41]](#Gupta2024Resistance2) There is minimal difference in recurrence rates between systemic agents (i.e. terbinafine vs. azole antifungals).​[[36]](#refitem-1142125-78018BE1) Topical antifungals may be less susceptible to resistance since they are not systemically absorbed.

Overall antifungal resistance may be reduced with combination treatment (i.e., topical and oral treatment) due to improved efficacy and treatment adherence.​[[35]](#Bermudez2023)​[[40]](#Gupta2024Resistance)

### OM in Children

OM is up to 50 times less common in children compared with adults, mainly due to reduced nail trauma, faster nail growth and improved peripheral blood flow. If possible, clinical diagnosis in children through mycological examination should be completed prior to treatment to ensure that the condition is OM.​[[42]](#Gupta2022Kids)

Topical treatment is preferred as dose adjustment and monitoring is not required, and adverse effects are minimal when compared to systemic treatment. In Canada, no therapy has been approved for treatment of OM in children; however, in the United States, ciclopirox and tavaborole have been approved for use in children ≥12 years of age and efinaconazole in children ≥6 years of age.​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[42]](#Gupta2022Kids)

Systemic therapies such as terbinafine and itraconazole can be used off-label in children, but caution is required because of adverse effects (including hepatotoxicity) and drug interactions. Adverse effects of systemic agents are similar to those experienced in adults (see [Table 3](#c0125n00024)).​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[42]](#Gupta2022Kids) Fluconazole has not been well studied in this patient population, and should be avoided if possible.​[[42]](#Gupta2022Kids)

Device-based therapies have not been studied in this patient population.​[[42]](#Gupta2022Kids)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Choices during Pregnancy

Since fungal nail infections are generally nonurgent problems and require many months of treatment, it is prudent to delay treatment until after pregnancy as there are limited controlled studies evaluating the safety of these treatments.​[[38]](#Gupta2023Safety) If drug treatment must be implemented, topical local therapy is preferred over oral systemic therapies.

Topical antifungals all display limited, if any, systemic absorption and are theoretically considered safe in pregnancy; however, studies evaluating toxicity in humans during pregnancy are lacking, so consider their use only when benefits outweigh potential risks.​[[30]](#Axler2024) Animal studies involving ciclopirox in pregnancy did not demonstrate teratogenicity; however, no human studies have been published. Use only if benefits exceed the potential risks of treatment.​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[43]](#Briggs)​[[44]](#Ricardo2020) Efinaconazole at high doses in animal models demonstrated maternal and fetal toxicity; it should be avoided in pregnancy until safety data in pregnant humans have been published.​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[43]](#Briggs)​[[44]](#Ricardo2020)

If possible, delay treatment with systemic agents until the postpartum period. Fluconazole is not recommended during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortion and major malformations in human pregnancies.​[[38]](#Gupta2023Safety)​[[43]](#Briggs) Itraconazole is not recommended for onychomycosis treatment as their fetal teratogenic effects were identified in animal models.​[[38]](#Gupta2023Safety)​[[43]](#Briggs) Oral terbinafine is currently not recommended in pregnancy;​[[43]](#Briggs) however, one recent systemic review indicated that there was no significant risks identified and that it could be used in pregnancy if it is deemed necessary to treat.​[[45]](#Foessleitner) Further studies are required to confirm this recommendation.

### Choices during Breastfeeding

There have been limited studies indicating the safety of the topical antifungals ciclopirox or efinaconazole in breastfeeding;​[[46]](#Lactmed) they are not recommended unless the benefits exceed the potential risks of treatment.​[[30]](#Axler2024)

Systemic treatment with fluconazole, itraconazole or terbinafine should be avoided during breastfeeding since there are limited studies to determine safety and these drugs can accumulate in breast milk.​[[30]](#Axler2024)​[[38]](#Gupta2023Safety) Although studies have shown no adverse effects in the infants of breastfeeding patients taking short-term (2–3 wk) courses of fluconazole for other indications,​[[46]](#Lactmed) it is not known if it is compatible with breastfeeding when used for many weeks in the treatment of OM.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Monitoring of Therapy

A monitoring plan for patients with onychomycosis is provided in [Table 2](#MonitoringTable). Resolution of the fungal infection takes months, while it can take up to 18 months for the appearance of the nail to return to normal, particularly in persons with poor circulation. The nail may never appear normal in some cases. Continued monitoring for recurrence of a nail infection or a concurrent skin infection is important. In patients with high risk of liver impairment (e.g., preexisting hepatotoxicity, concomitant medications that affect liver function, older persons), it is recommended that liver function tests (i.e., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase) be completed prior to systemic treatment and at 4–6 weeks after treatment.​[[39]](#Nenoff2023) Monitoring liver function in healthy patients is usually unnecessary when using terbinafine or pulsed itraconazole regimens for the treatment of onychomycosis; a discussion for the patient and prescriber to determine risk is recommended.​[[35]](#Bermudez2023)​[[39]](#Nenoff2023)

**Table 2:** Monitoring Parameters for Onychomycosis

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Treatment | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Abnormal nail appearance (e.g., nail separation, striations, discoloration) or nail growth | Patient: monthly Health-care practitioner: monitor based on treatment-specific recommendations | Cessation of growth of diseased nail. Normal appearance of nail based on recommended treatment duration | Further assessment is required if no improvement in nail appearance at expected endpoints. |
| Fatigue, jaundice, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine or pale stools due to oral antifungals | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: monthly | Absence of symptoms | Discontinue oral antifungal and perform liver function tests. |
| Paronychia ( Candida albicans) | Patient: weekly Health-care practitioner: monthly | No new lesions | Treat with topical nonprescription anti-yeast agents (clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin; see Fungal Skin Infections for more information). |
| Irritation caused by topical agents | Patient: daily while on therapy Health-care practitioner: monthly | Little or no irritation that subsides with continued use | Stop therapy if no improvement after several doses or if irritation is severe or affecting the patient’s quality of life. |
| Secondary bacterial infections: cellulitis | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: monthly | No new lesions | Further assessment required if signs of pain, swelling, skin discoloration/redness or drainage around nails. |

### Therapeutic Tips

- It is essential to confirm the diagnosis of OM prior to initiating treatment (i.e., microscopy and culture).
- Oral antifungals should be used with caution in persons with liver impairment.
- Systemic treatment duration with a daily antifungal dosing regimen is usually 6 weeks for fingernails and 12 weeks for toenails.
- Drug interactions can be significant with systemic agents and should be considered prior to treatment.

### Algorithms

**Figure 2:** Management of Onychomycosis

![](images/fungalnailinfections_appmanony.gif)

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad616638e1504) Oral terbinafine is first-line treatment when OM is caused by dermatophytes; itraconazole is first-line treatment when OM is caused by yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds. Note that supportive evidence is based on toenail OM; fingernail OM occurs less frequently and often involves yeasts.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd616638e1507) Consider systemic treatment of OM when a greater proportion of nail plate involved +/or >3 nails.

### Drug Table

**Table 3:** Antifungals for the Treatment of Onychomycosis

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions[b] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Allylamine Antifungals**

| terbinafine Lamisil , generics <$50 | Continuous dosing: Adults: 250 mg daily PO Children: 10 to <20 kg: 62.5 mg daily PO 20–40 kg: 125 mg daily PO >40 kg: 250 mg daily PO Duration: Fingernails: 6 wk​ [5] Toenails: 12 wk​ [35] Pulse dosing: Adults: 250 mg daily PO × 4 wk , then 4 wk off then repeat Alternative: 500 mg daily PO × 1 wk , then 3 wk off then repeat × 3 cycles ​ [35] ​ [39] | GI upset, headache, minor rashes,​ [1] alopecia areata, hair loss, psoriasis, pruritus, urticaria, Steven Johnson syndrome,​ [38] sensory loss of smell or taste, hearing disturbances. Rare: serious or fatal hepatotoxicity. | Cimetidine decreases and rifampicin increases systemic clearance of terbinafine. Terbinafine inhibits CYP2D6 enzymes and may decrease serum concentration of cyclosporine and formation of tamoxifen’s active metabolites. May increase serum concentration of atomoxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, tramadol and tricyclic antidepressants (monitor for toxicity). May decrease therapeutic effect of codeine. | Mycological cure rate​ [c] = 70%.​ [1] Clinical cure rate​ [d] = 38%.​ [1] Obtain baseline and mid-treatment (at 4–6 wk ) serum aminotransferase levels.​ [39] More effective for dermatophyte OM (tinea unguium) with fewer serious side effects and drug interactions than itraconazole or fluconazole. Continuous terbinafine regimen is more effective than pulse itraconazole.​ [5] |

**Drug Class: Azole Antifungals**

| efinaconazole 10% solution Jublia $100–150 ​ [e] | Apply 1 drop once daily (preferably at bedtime) to the affected nail, nail bed, undersurface of the nail plate and surrounding skin. Use 2 drops if the affected nail is the great toenail Duration: Toenails: up to 48 wk ​ [17] | Nail discoloration, application site erythema, vesicles, allergic contact dermatitis. | Minimal systemic absorption; potential interactions have not been evaluated. | Mycological cure rate:​ [c] Fingernail = 61%​ [1] ​ [30] Toenail = 54%​ [1] ​ [30] Clinical cure rate:​ [d] Fingernail = 14%​ [1] ​ [30] Toenail = 47%​ [1] ​ [30] Use in mild to moderate infection caused by dermotaphytes, non-dermotophytes or yeasts.​ [3] ​ [28] |
| fluconazole Diflucan , generics <$50 | Pulse dosing: Adults: 150 mg once weekly PO until nail grows out​ [17] ​ [39] Children: 3–6 mg/kg once weekly PO Duration: Fingernails: 3–6 months ​ [39] Toenails: 6–12 months ​ [39] | Nausea, headache, pruritus, facial edema, hepatotoxic reactions. | Inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Decreases serum concentration of clopidogrel’s active metabolites and enhances the QT c -prolonging effect of dronedarone, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, methadone, pimozide, quinine, tricyclic antidepressants and ziprasidone. Decreases metabolism (monitor for toxic effects) of alfuzosin, atorvastatin, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, clarithromycin, colchicine, cyclosporine, erythromycin, fentanyl, lovastatin, midazolam, phenytoin, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, simvastatin, solifenacin, sulfonylureas, tacrolimus and warfarin. | Alternative agent and off-label use;​ [1] ​ [28] less cost-effective than terbinafine or itraconazole. Mycological cure rate​ [c] = 55–59% .​ [47] Clinical cure rate​ [d] = 20%.​ [47] Some evidence that treatment period for cure of toenail (and possibly fingernail) OM should be >6 months .​ [47] |
| itraconazole Sporanox Capsules , Sporanox Oral Solution , Odan Itraconazole , other generics Pulsed: Adults: $100–150 Children: <$50 Continuous: Adults: $200–250 | Continuous dosing: Adults: 200 mg once daily PO​ [1] ​ [39] Duration:​ [5] Fingernails: 6 wk Toenails: 12 wk Pulsed dosing: Adults: 200 mg BID PO × 1 wk , off for 3 wk Duration:​ [1] ​ [5] ​ [17] Fingernails: 8 wk Toenails: 12 wk Children: <20 kg: 5 mg/kg daily PO × 1 wk , off for 3 wk 20 to <40 kg: 100 mg daily PO × 1 wk , off for 3 wk 40–50 kg: 200 mg daily PO × 1 wk , off for 3 wk >50 kg: 200 mg BID PO × 1 wk , off for 3 wk Duration: Fingernails: 8 wk Toenails: 12 wk | GI upset, headache,​ [1] hearing loss, tinnitus, minor rashes, pruritus, urticaria. Rare: serious or fatal hepatotoxicity, heart failure, Stevens Johnson syndrome.​ [38] | Potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Avoid use with or make appropriate dosage reductions (and monitor for toxic effects) with alfuzosin, atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, digoxin, dronedarone, eplerenone, ergot derivatives, erythromycin, lovastatin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, pimozide, quinidine, rivaroxaban, salmeterol, simvastatin, solifenacin, tacrolimus, tamsulosin and warfarin. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors increase gastric pH and decrease itraconazole’s absorption. | Preferred initial agent for treatment of nondermatophyte OM . Pulse regimen preferred over continuous regimen as drug interactions and side effects are less pronounced compared with continuous therapy. Pulsed regimen: Mycological cure rate​ [c] = 54%.​ [1] Continuous regimen: Mycological cure rate​ [c] = 54%.​ [48] Clinical cure rate​ [d] = 14%.​ [48] Obtain baseline and mid-treatment (4–6 wk) serum aminotransferase levels.​ [39] |
