### Introduction

Interacting with patients effectively is a key role for pharmacists. Throughout an interaction, the participants (e.g., the pharmacist and the patient) alternate between the roles of “sender” and “receiver” of the message. Information should not be provided in a unidirectional manner. Rather, information is exchanged. As a receiver, the pharmacist has the responsibility of listening to what the patient is saying, understanding the issue and providing feedback on whether the message was understood. As the sender, the pharmacist has the responsibility of transmitting the message clearly, in language understood by the patient and in an environment conducive to clear transmission.

For effective patient interaction, pharmacists should display empathy and compassion for the patient’s situation. When sending information, consider how the interaction is organized and how well verbal and nonverbal communication skills are used.

When receiving information, pharmacists should take note of what the patient is saying and observe their use of verbal and nonverbal communication throughout the interaction to ensure that a full description of the presenting complaint and associated symptoms, as well as other relevant information, are gathered.

There are 3 major stages or types of patient interactions: assessment and triage, education, and follow-up. This chapter provides guidance on how these interactions can be organized and gives examples of the topics and questions that could be included. Examples of application in a community pharmacy setting are provided; however, these skills can be applied in all areas of practice. Further detailed discussion of the process of assessment and triage can be found in Pharmacist Process for Care of the Self-Treating Patient.

### Assessment and Triage

The primary purposes of this stage of the interaction with a patient are to determine the nature of the patient’s concerns or symptoms and to determine whether it is within the pharmacist’s scope of practice to address these concerns or if referral to another provider is necessary. Use these initial steps in greeting the patient, finding out about the problem, and ensuring comfort and privacy. The interaction then may progress to the pharmacist conducting the patient interview and assessment process. The emphasis is on skillfully eliciting relevant information from the patient so that the pharmacist gains a complete picture of the patient’s issue and does not jump to conclusions about what the patient needs. This is also the point at which the pharmacist begins to build rapport with the patient and earns that person’s trust.

### How

- Introduce yourself or greet the patient by name if known
- Confirm how the patient would like to be addressed
- Find out briefly what the patient needs
- Explain, in a general way, how you can help
- Ensure comfort and privacy to demonstrate that you are concerned about how the patient is feeling and value the importance of confidentiality
- Proceed with questioning, listening and basic physical assessment (if required) for assessment and triage. Suggestions for the assessment process can be found in Pharmacist Process for Care of the Self-Treating Patient

Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in [Figure 1](#psc1002n00004).

Use good communication skills. This will both help you send messages in a manner that can be understood by the patient and help you understand the messages that you receive. Both verbal and nonverbal communication skills are important and should complement one another. Good verbal communication skills and poor or distracting nonverbal skills send conflicting messages, and the patient may become confused or lose confidence in the pharmacist. The reverse is also true.

**Figure 1:** What to Say When Assessing Patients

Verbal communication skills include the ability to question appropriately (see [Table 1](#psc1002n00005)), using language the patient can understand (see [Table 2](#psc1002n00006)), listening effectively (see [Table 3](#psc1002n00016)) and responding using empathy (see [Table 4](#psc1002n00020)).

Nonverbal communication transmits more than half of the messages that people send and receive. These skills must be practised when the pharmacist is both speaking and listening to the patient. Techniques to optimize nonverbal communication are outlined in [Table 5](#psc1002n00023).

The importance of listening and being empathetic, through effective verbal and nonverbal communication, cannot be underestimated. Spending time without being distracted, as well as understanding patient feelings and perspectives without judging, criticizing or blaming, builds acceptance and respect that creates a strong patient-pharmacist relationship.

**Table 1:** Appropriate Questions

| Use open-ended questions: | Use closed-ended questions: | Avoid: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When you need to gather symptom information that is most prominent in the patient’s mind When you need to begin a line of questioning When you want to determine the patient’s understanding, level of sophistication of the assessment of the problem and level of vocabulary that would be appropriate for you to use To convey a willingness to listen To promote rapport and trust Examples: Describe... (the feeling to me) Explain... (how the pain feels) Tell me about... (the heartburn) How... (does the headache feel?) What... (brings you in today?) | When you want a yes, no or number response When you want to gather specific, focused information about the nature of the symptoms and treatment When you need to gather information quickly When you need to keep a talkative patient focused Examples: Do you... (have any discharge?) Have you... (ever had this before?) Will you... (be able to take this every 4 hours?) How many times... (do you wake up during the night?) | Using only open-ended questions (will make the discussion much longer and unfocused) Using only closed-ended questions (will prevent discussion from moving to details of which you are unaware; may create passivity) Asking several questions in succession without patient input. For example, asking “Is the pain mostly in your stomach or is it more like heartburn?” “What does it feel like?” “Do you usually get it after you eat?” one after another without giving the patient a chance to answer Asking leading or biased questions. For example, “There isn’t any blood in your stool, is there?” Asking questions that start with “why” (can seem judgmental and cause defensiveness) Using slang or medical terminology |

**Table 2:** Appropriate Language

| Use: | Not: | Use: | Not: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A lot of phlegm | Productive | Digestive system | Gastrointestinal |
| High blood pressure | Hypertension | Lower | Decrease |
| Painkiller | Analgesic | Raise | Increase or elevate |
| Cough suppressant | Antitussive | Condition | Diagnosis |
| Shooting pain | Radiating pain | How bad | Severity |
| Heart attack | Myocardial infarction | On the skin | Topically |

**Table 3:** Effective Listening

| You are listening when you: | You are not listening when you: |
| --- | --- |
| Encourage talking, e.g., “hmm,” “yes,” “go on” Wait during silence (allows the patient a chance to think and react) Repeat (“So, you’re having difficulty sleeping”) Reflect (“How do you feel about that?”) Explore (“Could you say a bit more about that?”) Summarize accurately Ask questions Paraphrase | Are in a hurry (e.g., looking at watch) Interrupt Change subject for no apparent reason Ask a question twice Don’t ask any questions at all Are talking Don’t allow the patient a chance to finish speaking Lecture Cut off expressions of feeling Give advice prematurely |

**Table 4:** Effective Responses​​[[a]](#afn1431)

| Use empathy: | Avoid automatically giving the following responses until you understand what the patient is feeling: |
| --- | --- |
| Make an effort to understand how the patient is feeling;​ [b] respond to that feeling (e.g., “That must be incredibly difficult; I can imagine how painful that is”) Some of what the patient tells you involves his or her feelings about it; be sensitive to those feelings | Judgmental or critical responses (“You shouldn’t be doing that”) Advising/recommending responses Reassuring responses (“You’ll be fine”) Generalizing responses (“Everybody feels that way”) Distracting responses, e.g., changing the subject |

[a] *Some responses will be factual but always consider why the patient raised the point or asked the question.*

[b] *You can learn a lot about a patient’s feelings by observing nonverbal behaviour: does the person look sad? frustrated? angry? weak or sick? worried? in pain?*

**Table 5:** Nonverbal Communication

| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Smile (when appropriate) Demonstrate genuine interest and concern Maintain eye contact as culturally and socially appropriate Use appropriate body language (show interest and concern in your facial expression, maintain appropriate distance from the patient, keep your body posture open, lean forward) Sit or squat if the patient is sitting, stand if the patient is standing Have a neat and clean personal appearance and a neat and clean physical environment | Look down or away repeatedly Look at or touch other objects repeatedly Cross your arms or your legs Use distracting gestures Tilt to one side Slouch Stare Get so close that you are in the patient’s “personal space” Have barriers between you and the patient (high counter) |

### Education

The main purposes of this stage of interaction are to review available treatment options and provide education that will enable the patient to gain the most benefit. Again, the pharmacist acts as both the “sender” and “receiver” of messages, but with more emphasis on sending messages to the patient. To ensure education is effective, pay attention to transmitting the message clearly and explicitly without adhering to a strict monologue type of interaction. Continually check for understanding throughout and pay attention to new information that the patient may offer.

### How

- Establish goals
- Help with selection of treatment options
- Provide information (while continuing to listen to the patient for new information)
- Check for understanding
- Close

Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in [Figure 2](#psc1002n00025).

Use strong verbal and nonverbal communication skills. The same skills highlighted in the [Follow-Up](#psc1002n00002) section apply. Additional verbal skills that are useful in the educational component of the interaction include the rate, volume, tone and pitch of speech. These are outlined in [Table 6](#psc1002n00024).

The nonverbal skills used in educating are the same as those used in assessment and triage. You may need to use additional nonverbal skills to indicate the closure of the interaction. Examples are standing up (if sitting), changing stance, shaking hands, and sometimes packing up papers or putting pen and paper away.

### Follow-Up

Use follow-up to determine whether the patient’s goals were achieved with the plan selected and that no red flag has arisen that would require referral for medical treatment. Follow-up is similar in format to a combination of both the assessment/triage phase and the education phase. Ideally, it’s best if the same person provides the follow-up, as this is the person with whom the patient has developed a relationship. Let the patient know you would like to call within a few days to ensure that the plan is working and that no problems have developed with the medication. Patients appreciate this and are often happy to arrange a time for you to call. In the scenario where a patient does not want follow-up, provide them with information on how to best contact you if any questions or concerns arise regarding the plan.

### How

- Introduce yourself
- Explain purpose of follow-up
- Assess response
- Advise if necessary
- Close

Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in [Figure 3](#psc1002n00030).

**Table 6:** Verbal Skills

| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Slow down; resist the temptation to “download” information quickly, e.g., learn to pause when there are natural breaks in your sentences. This helps the patient digest the information and provides an opportunity for the person to speak if there is a question or another piece of information to provide Speak loud enough so the patient can hear you Speak in a friendly tone Raise and lower the pitch of your voice appropriately (lower at the end of sentences; lower if patient is hard of hearing) Use precise language, e.g., “with an 8-oz glass of water,” not “with plenty of water” or “1 hour before a meal,” not “on an empty stomach” Write information down when verbal explanation is not sufficient | Increase the rate of speech (tempting when you have a lot of information to provide) Speak so loudly that others in the pharmacy can also hear you (have another staff member tell you if your conversation was heard) Speak in a condescending or patronizing manner Speak in a monotonous voice pitch (boring) Raise your pitch at the end of a sentence (sounds like you are questioning yourself) Hand out printed written information without also providing a verbal review |

Use good communication skills. A major difference between follow-up interactions and assessment/triage and educational interactions is that this discussion often takes place over the telephone. Since neither you nor the patient will be able to read each other’s nonverbal cues, particular attention must be paid to clear verbal communication. Verbal skills are outlined in [Table 7](#psc1002n00028).

The nonverbal messages you send will confirm your real interest in and concern for the patient. They will also make it easier for both of you to hear each other. Techniques for optimizing nonverbal communication during telephone conversations are outlined in [Table 8](#psc1002n00029).

**Table 7:** Verbal Skills to Use during Telephone Conversations

| Do: |
| --- |
| Start with a friendly greeting Confirm the patient’s identity (e.g., “I’m looking to speak with Mr. Smith” or “May I speak with Mr. Smith?”) Confirm that now is a good time for them to talk Speak more slowly than you would face to face Enunciate clearly Let the patient know if you need to stop talking to write something down or pause to think Confirm that the patient can hear you if you use a speaker phone Hold the receiver an appropriate distance from your mouth so that your voice is not muffled or too soft |

**Table 8:** Nonverbal Skills to Use during Telephone Conversations

| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare for the call Give your full attention to the phone call Smile to help ensure your voice carries a friendly tone Listen carefully to the tone of the patient’s voice and speech in order to determine concerns or misunderstandings | Put the patient on hold (unless necessary to find information for the patient) Allow interruptions Have background noise, e.g., voices, music, ringing telephones Let conversation be overheard by other people |

### Tips for Special Situations

Tips for interacting with the talkative patient who gets off topic:

- Minimize your contribution to the “off topic”
- Acknowledge but continue returning to the questioning or education; if possible, try to link the therapy discussion to the “off topic,” e.g., patient starts talking about husband’s death 2 years ago; ask “Is that when your stomach problems started?” then focus discussion back onto today’s presenting complaint
- Try referring back to the discussion about the presenting complaint and introducing a closed-ended question (e.g., “A few minutes ago, you said that you were having trouble sleeping; have you had this problem before?”), then continue with the line of questioning

Tips for interacting with the angry patient:

- Remember that feelings of hostility are rarely personal; the patient may be under a great deal of stress
- Acknowledge anger
- Let patients express their anger
- Stay calm
- Lower your voice, speak slowly and maintain eye contact
- If you are at fault, agree; agreeing often diffuses anger
- Avoid defensiveness (which can aggravate the situation)

Tips for interacting with the depressed/upset/crying patient:

- Offer privacy, tissues, time alone
- Offer to call someone
- Ask “Is it something you want to talk about?”

Tips for interacting with the patient who does not want to see another health-care provider:

- Explain your reasons for concern; be assertive, e.g., “When diarrhea goes on longer than 2 weeks, I worry that there could be something serious going on; it’s important to see a doctor because then you can determine if there are any serious problems”

Tips for interacting with patients who do not want to take your advice:

- Determine preferences before providing a recommendation
- Explain advantages and disadvantages in terms of patient’s medications and medical conditions
- Consider “rolling with it”; sometimes resistance is normal (think of products to help with smoking cessation); consider using techniques of motivational interviewing described in Facilitating Behaviour Change if behaviour change is challenging

Tips for interacting with the patient with hearing impairment:

- Ask if the patient can hear you
- Ask if it is better to speak to one side
- Face the patient so the person can read your lips
- Speak more slowly, enunciate clearly and lower your tone of voice to make it easier for the patient to differentiate words
- Increase your volume of speech but don’t shout
- Use short, simple sentences
- Pause often when giving instructions and confirm understanding
- Keep in mind that your facial expression, body posture and gesture are as important as lip movements for the patient to understand what you are saying
- Use technology, e.g., Pocketalker to amplify the sound of your voice (with a microphone) in the patient’s ear (with a wearable headset)

Tips for interacting with the patient with vision impairment:

- Tell the patient what you are doing and if there is anyone else present, e.g., a student
- If writing information, use large print and pastel-coloured paper rather than white

Tips for interacting with the patient with cognitive impairment:

- Speak slowly
- Allow time for patient to answer questions
- Write information down
- Decrease the amount of information given at one time

Tips for interacting with the noncommunicative patient:

- Wait during silence so the patient can respond
- Ask open-ended questions

Tips for interacting with the patient with a potentially embarrassing complaint:

- Offer privacy
- Use closed-ended questions for assessment, e.g., “Do you have any discharge?” “Is it clear or white?” *not* “Tell me about the discharge”

Tips for interacting with the patient with speech impairment:

- Speak slowly
- Face the patient
- Let the patient finish speaking
- Provide writing pads
- Learn simple sign language if used by the patient
- Use an LCD e-writer, e.g., Boogie Board that the patient can use to write messages, then erase them when they’re ready to write the next message

Tips for interacting with the aphasic patient (patients who have perhaps suffered a stroke and have a decreased ability to understand what others are saying and to express themselves):

- Do not shout
- Avoid complex conversations
- Be patient
- Minimize background noise
- Talk to the caregiver

Tips for interacting with a person seeking help/advice on behalf of another person (when the patient is not present):

- Confirm the individual seeking help/advice has consent to discuss and receive information about the patient
- Determine whether the person has sufficient knowledge to answer questions about the patient’s health or condition
- Provide written information for the patient
- Follow-up directly with the patient (if possible)

Tips for interacting with the patient who does not speak your language:

- Speak slowly and simply (if there is some comprehension of your language)
- Demonstrate, rather than explain
- Use an interpreter, ideally a medical translator, but if needed, a caregiver
- Provide written material for the patient, in the appropriate language if available

Tips for interacting with recent immigrants:

- Ask “How would a pharmacist help you in your home country?”
- Ask more closed-ended questions and use shorter sentences (if they have a different first language than yours)

### Evaluate Yourself

We can all improve our communication skills. There are some easy ways to evaluate your effectiveness. Try audio or video recording some patient interactions (with permission of course). You may find that you sound different and say things that are different from what you thought you said. Look for nonverbal cues in others: What do you like? What do you dislike? Think about the nonverbal cues that you send. Have a student or colleague watch you interact with a patient and then give you some feedback. Think about the patient: Were they relaxed and open during your discussion? Did you check for patient understanding? How did you do?
