### Breastfeeding

### Introduction

Exclusive breastfeeding, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is considered the gold standard for infant feeding during the first 6 months of life.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)​[[2]](#psc1042n1002)​[[3]](#psc1042n1003)​[[4]](#psc1042n01121) This means providing only breast milk—no solids or other liquids, including water—with the exception of vitamin/mineral supplements and medicines in drop or syrup form. Beyond the first 6 months, breastfeeding continues to benefit the nutritional, emotional and immunologic health of the child until up to 2 years of age.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)​[[2]](#psc1042n1002)

Statistics Canada reported that a majority (90.9%) of people in Canada attempt to breastfeed their babies;​[[5]](#psc1042n01122)​[[6]](#psc1042n01123) however, only 38% of those breastfeed exclusively for at least 6 months.​[[5]](#psc1042n01122) Because breastfeeding rates remain low in some provinces and duration rates are below ideal levels across Canada, health-care professionals have an important role in promoting this crucial preventive health measure.

Peer support groups provide information, practical assistance and emotional support for breastfeeding using a person-to-person approach. These include local La Leche League Canada groups and breastfeeding classes. Many hospitals offer breastfeeding support and/or a breastfeeding clinic. Health-care professionals can augment this support by ensuring that therapeutic or other interventions, if possible, allow an individual to maintain the breastfeeding relationship with the baby.​[[7]](#psc1042n1006) Problems encountered that may compromise continuation of breastfeeding should be addressed by health-care professionals with expertise in breastfeeding (e.g., public health nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, physicians) as well as La Leche League Canada leaders or International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs).

### Benefits of Breastfeeding

Human milk feeding has short- and long-term benefits including improvement in health (specifically GI function, host defense and neurodevelopment) as well as social, psychological and economic advantages.​[[3]](#psc1042n1003)​[[7]](#psc1042n1006)​[[8]](#psc1042n1005) All alternative feeding products are measured against the known benefits of human milk with regard to growth and development. Research shows that human milk feeding reduces the incidence and in many cases the severity of a number of illnesses, such as asthma, childhood leukemia, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, necrotizing enterocolitis, nonspecific gastroenteritis, otitis media, severe lower respiratory tract infections and sudden infant death syndrome.​[[9]](#psc1042n01125)​[[10]](#Gungor2019ACL)​[[11]](#Horta2019)​[[12]](#Gungor2019DM)​[[13]](#Obbagy2019) Recent data suggests that delaying the introduction of formula feeding decreases the risk of early childhood excessive weight and obesity.​[[14]](#Ortega2018)​[[15]](#Wallby2017) Among infants exposed to gestational diabetes, breastfeeding also significantly reduced the likelihood of developing obesity.​[[16]](#Vandyousefi2021) Preterm infants fed human milk show improved developmental outcomes when compared with formula-fed infants.​[[17]](#psc1042n1022)​[[18]](#psc1042n1023)​[[19]](#psc1042n1024) Although the evidence is not as compelling as for preterm infant data, studies have shown improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in full-term breastfed infants.​[[20]](#psc1042n1025) Further research is needed to clarify any potential effect on atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and infant mortality.​[[9]](#psc1042n01125)​[[13]](#Obbagy2019)​[[21]](#Gungor2019IBD)​[[22]](#Gungor2019CVD)

In addition to health benefits for the infant, breastfeeding also contributes to a number of health benefits for the person breastfeeding.​[[9]](#psc1042n01125) These include decreased postpartum bleeding and more rapid return to prepregnancy uterine size,​[[23]](#psc1042n1034) reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, reduced risk of postpartum depression and a decreased risk of some cancers (breast and ovarian).​[[9]](#psc1042n01125)​[[24]](#psc1042n1036) The relationship between breastfeeding and improved bone health​[[25]](#psc1042n1037) and more rapid return to prepregnancy weight​[[26]](#psc1042n1035)​[[27]](#Tahir2019) requires further study.​[[9]](#psc1042n01125)

### Contraindications to Breastfeeding

Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. In Canada, breastfeeding might be contraindicated in the following scenarios:​[[3]](#psc1042n1003)​[[28]](#psc1042n1039)​[[29]](#TomlinsonCHaiekLN.BreastfeedingAndH)

- In infants:

  - *Metabolic disorders*: Conditions such as classic galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism where the infant cannot tolerate breast milk, necessitate exclusive feeding with specialized formulas.

- In breastfeeding individuals:

  - *Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)*: HIV antibody positive individuals are advised to avoid breastfeeding and feed their infants with commercial milk formula.
  - *Active, untreated tuberculosis*: Individuals with untreated active tuberculosis should refrain from breastfeeding until they have been treated for at least 2 weeks and are no longer infectious.​[[30]](#TBguidelines)
  - *Untreated brucellosis*​[[31]](#psc1042n01126)
  - *Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I or II infection*
  - *Active herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection with lesions present on the breast*: If lesions are present on the breast, expressed breast milk (hand expressed or pumped) should be discarded. Patients can breastfeed if the lesions are located elsewhere on the body, if the lesions are fully covered and if hand hygiene measures to avoid transmission are in place. This means a patient can breastfeed directly from an unaffected breast if these measures are taken.
  - *Certain medications or medical procedures incompatible with breastfeeding*: This includes drugs like some chemotherapy agents, radioisotopes or nuclear medicine agents. Health-care providers should consult reputable resources to assess medication compatibility with breastfeeding.

Respiratory infections such as COVID-19, influenza and viral rhinitis are not contraindications to breastfeeding. Patients should practice respiratory etiquette, wear a mask and perform hand hygiene to reduce the risk of transmission.​[[32]](#WHOCOVID)​[[33]](#CDCFluguidelines) Breastfeeding may continue immediately after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.​[[34]](#SOGCCOVID-19Vaccines)

### Temporary Interruptions

Most illnesses in breastfeeding patients are compatible with breastfeeding. However, temporary interruptions may be required under specific circumstances:

- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection:

  - CMV is present in approximately 55% of breastfeeding individuals in Canada; routine testing for CMV status is not recommended. While unpasteurized breast milk from CMV-positive breastfeeding individuals carries a small but measurable risk of transmission to preterm infants, it is not considered a contraindication for breastfeeding in term infants. For preterm infant cases, pasteurization or alternative feeding may be necessary.
- Severe illness or injury of breastfeeding patient:

  - If a breastfeeding individual’s condition prevents them from caring for the infant, families should be supported in expressing and safely storing breast milk, if possible.

### Establishing Breastfeeding

Breastfed babies nurse for both food and comfort. Direct skin-to-skin contact between the person breastfeeding and the baby soon after birth can help to establish breastfeeding.​[[35]](#MooreERAndersonGCBergmanNEtAl.Early-00ACD1FB) Breastfeeding should be encouraged every 2–3 hours (8–12 feedings in a 24-hour period) during the first weeks postpartum. Educate patients about the signs of hunger, satiety and a good latch and letdown. Breastfed babies may seem to be more wakeful and to feed more frequently because the components in human milk are easily and readily digested. Colostrum, the yellowish milk produced in the first day or 2 is high in nutrients and immunoglobulins. Because this substance is present in small amounts, the baby is stimulated to nurse frequently, which establishes an appropriate milk supply. On day 3 or 4 postpartum, colostrum changes to mature milk. Milk supply then increases to the individualized quantity required by the baby or babies in the case of multiple births. Removal of milk, through breastfeeding or expressing, acts to increase production of milk.

Infants who do not readily arouse for feeding should be wakened to feed if more than 4 hours have elapsed since the start of the last feeding. After breastfeeding is established, the number of feedings usually declines to 6–8 every 24 hours.​[[3]](#psc1042n1003)

Around 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months of age, it is normal for babies to nurse more frequently for a few days to increase milk supply to meet their growing needs. By reviewing the signs of adequate milk supply, health-care professionals can help a patient differentiate a growth spurt from a change in milk supply.

Once the milk supply comes in, a well-hydrated, healthy baby will have 3–5 wet diapers by day 3–5 and 4–6 wet diapers daily by day 5–7. The urine should be odourless and pale. Brick-coloured crystals in the baby’s diaper indicate the infant is not receiving appropriate amounts of fluid and necessitates referral, especially if the child is under 6 weeks of age. Once the baby’s first stool, called meconium, has passed in the first several days, the breastfed baby will have 2–5 loose, unformed yellow/green/tan bowel movements per day. After 6 weeks of age, the number of bowel movements and wet diapers may become less frequent. Healthy breastfed infants require no extra water, even in hot weather, as long as breastfeeding is readily available to the infant.

Perceived insufficient milk supply (PIMS) is common among people who are breastfeeding, especially in the first week after birth, among primiparous individuals and those who have lower breastfeeding efficiency.​[[36]](#Huang2022) PIMS may lead to early cessation of breastfeeding or switching to infant formula. Certain infant behaviours are often misattributed to an insufficient milk supply (e.g., crying or fussing, sucking).​[[36]](#Huang2022) If an insufficient milk supply is suspected, a breastfeeding expert should assess the problem and initiate counselling, relaxation techniques or mechanical expression. If nonpharmacologic therapy is unsuccessful, the use of galactagogues (i.e., substances that induce lactation) may be considered. See [Table 3](#galactogogues) for a summary of commonly used galactagogues.

### Products that Support Breastfeeding

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Breastfeeding Products: Collection Accessories, Nipple Accessories, Pumps.

Milk expression is essential for any infant who is not nursing successfully because it provides an important signal to the breastfeeding person’s body to produce more milk. Thus, all people who are breastfeeding should be taught how to express their milk using hand expression and/or a breast pump (see [Figure 1](#psc1042n01081)), as this affords them the ability to stimulate milk supply in case of physical separation from the infant or an alternative if the infant is not feeding effectively at the breast. Hand expression may also be necessary to relieve breast engorgement after milk production increases, especially in the absence of a breast pump. Education on hand expression often begins soon after the birth, but may require reinforcement by a health-care provider with expertise in breastfeeding as the person’s milk supply and the infant’s needs change.

Hand expression is accomplished by placing the thumb and forefingers well behind the areola toward the chest wall and then compressing them together and toward the nipple in a rhythmic fashion. See [La Leche League International](https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/hand-expressing/) and the [Stanford Medicine video](https://med.stanford.edu/newborns/professional-education/breastfeeding/hand-expressing-milk.html) for the steps involved in hand expression of breast milk.

### Breast Pumps

**Figure 1:** Breast Pump

![](images/infantnutritionpsc_brepum.gif)

Several companies offer a range of electric breast pumps for purchase or rent. Advise patients to speak with their local hospital’s breastfeeding support clinic for information. Electric breast pumps are most effective and are recommended when a breastfeeding individual is separated from a hospitalized baby, when milk must be removed quickly and efficiently, or when the baby is unable to nurse (when breasts are engorged). Most electric pumps have adapter kits that allow both breasts to be pumped at the same time. This facilitates removal of milk and increases stimulation, which in turn increases milk supply. The kits can often be turned into manual cylinder or handle-squeeze pumps with the purchase of adapter parts.

Usually a good quality, manual (hand-operated) pump will suffice for the occasional feed when breastfeeding is not possible, and recent evidence suggests that hand expression and low-cost pumps may be as effective as larger, more costly electric pumps.​[[37]](#Becker2016) Additionally, relaxation techniques (e.g., massage, warmth, music) may increase the volume of milk yielded when pumped.​[[37]](#Becker2016) Bicycle horn–type pumps are not recommended, as lack of control on suction may bruise the breast, and milk can collect in and contaminate the bulb.

When recommending the most appropriate method of milk expression, consider time since birth, purpose of expression, cost and availability, as well as the individual person and infant.​[[37]](#Becker2016)

Report any instances of breast pumps causing damage or injury during use to [Health Canada’s Medical Device Problem Reporting program](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/adverse-reaction-reporting/mandatory-medical-device-problem-reporting-form-industry-adverse-reaction-reporting.html).

### Breast Pads

Breast pads should be avoided when possible.​[[38]](#TorontoPublicHealth2013) If needed because of leaking, reusable, washable 100% cotton breast pads are recommended, as disposable pads with plastic or occlusive liners promote dampness and increase the risk of a yeast (*Candida albicans*) infection on the breast.​[[38]](#TorontoPublicHealth2013) Breast pads should be changed after each feeding or more often if they become wet. Cut-up disposable baby diapers should not be used, as the water-retaining beads in the diapers can be harmful to the baby if accidentally ingested. Once breastfeeding is established, after 6–8 weeks, leaking is not usually a problem.

### Nipple Shields

A silicone nipple shield is a breastfeeding aid worn over the nipple and areola while the baby nurses to overcome latch problems (e.g., flat nipples) or to help infants with physical challenges or impaired suck mechanisms (see [Photo 1](#NippleShieldImage)).​[[39]](#Chow2015) However, its use remains controversial, as literature suggests that over time, nipple shields may lower the milk supply, resulting in early unplanned weaning.​[[39]](#Chow2015) On the other hand, some limited data suggest that its use increases comfort without significantly affecting sucking dynamics, breast emptying or milk transfer.​[[40]](#Viviane2021) In the absence of strong evidence of benefit or harm, the decision to use a nipple shield should therefore be individualized and followed by a timely assessment of the effectiveness and appropriateness of this tool.​[[39]](#Chow2015)

### Breast Shells

Breast shells are firm, plastic, cup-shaped devices that can be worn inside a bra between feeds to provide air flow during healing of an abraded nipple or to shape the nipple between feeds for easier latch of the baby (see [Photo 2](#BreastShell)). Wearing the shells inside a bra for several hours per day for 6–12 weeks before delivery may draw out flat or inverted nipples. An estimated 10% of individuals have nipples that retract rather than protrude when the areola is compressed. However, proper latch of the baby after birth may overcome this problem.​[[41]](#psc1042n01117) Breast shells are not to be used to collect milk or in place of breast pads. Constant pressure on the ducts interferes with natural control mechanisms for leaking.

### Care for Breastfeeding Patients

Breastfeeding individuals should drink to satisfy their thirst and eat according to *Canada’s Food Guide*.​[[42]](#psc1042n1042) It is also recommended to continue taking a multivitamin that includes folic acid for at least 4–6 weeks postpartum and as long as breastfeeding continues.​[[43]](#Wilson2015) For information regarding galactagogues, see [Establishing Breastfeeding](#psc1042n01078).

### Nipple Trauma

Nipple trauma is a cutaneous lesion in the area of the nipple and areola manifesting as fissures, ulceration, inflammation, edema, blisters, pain or bruising. Nipple trauma is common among newly breastfeeding individuals with an incidence ranging from 29–76%.​[[44]](#psc1042n01130) The most common cause of nipple trauma is improper latch of the baby to the breast. A proper latch is an attachment that causes no overt pain and maximizes transfer of milk to baby, see [Photo 3](#psc1042n01119). Advise those with nipple pain to contact a breastfeeding expert to check the baby’s position on the breast. Lanolin, alone or with breast shells, and breast milk expressed and applied before and after each feeding have demonstrated efficacy in reducing nipple trauma.​[[44]](#psc1042n01130) Applying **olive oil** before suckling was effective for sore nipples in a preliminary study.​[[45]](#psc1042n01129) Irrespective of which treatment is used (including no treatment), most nipple pain subsides to low levels 7–10 days postpartum; pain lasting beyond 2 weeks often requires further evaluation.​[[46]](#DennisCLJacksonKWatsonJ.Interventio-00AD5F9D)​[[47]](#Berens2016)

1. Look for the following signs of a good latch:
   - Infant’s head is straight, not turned to the side
   - Infant’s nose and chin are touching or almost touching the breast
   - Infant’s upper and lower lips are curled outward
   - Infant’s lips cover the nipple as well as the areola (mouth opens wide around breast, not just the nipple)
   - Infant makes audible swallows​[[48]](#CoteArsenault2012)
   - The latch is comfortable and pain-free for the breastfeeding person​[[49]](#Odom2013)​[[50]](#McClellan2015)

Thrush (due to the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans) is another common cause of nipple and breast pain, usually occurring later in the course of breastfeeding. Burning or stabbing pain as well as red, shiny skin on the nipple and areola are characteristic signs. Prior treatment with antibiotics predisposes patients to yeast infections on the breast. If there is a diagnosis of thrush on the breast, it is important that both the adult and baby are treated. The person breastfeeding may use a topical antifungal cream, e.g., nystatin or clotrimazole (see Fungal Skin Infections). The baby may be prescribed an oral antifungal medication such as nystatin. Those who are breastfeeding should practise good hygiene to prevent infecting or reinfecting the baby or developing a vaginal yeast infection.

Any product applied to the breast or nipple area should be wiped off before nursing.

### Sore Breasts

A common cause of pain and swelling of the breasts during the establishment of breastfeeding is engorgement, typically caused by the arrival of new milk.​[[51]](#TheAcademyOfBreastfeedingMedicinePr-011996B0) Mild engorgement is normal and is a sign that an adequate milk supply exists. However, if the engorgement is severely symptomatic and painful, it should be treated. Nonpharmacologic options include breast massage, the application of warm packs before a breastfeed and cold packs following a feed, and applying gentle pressure to the areola to move the swelling upward into the breast; the latter helps with the infant’s latch. If these measures do not enable the infant to latch, manual expression should be tried. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are also safe treatment options for the management of breast engorgement.

Mastitis is a painful inflammatory condition of the breast usually resulting from a plugged duct or breast infection. A plugged duct occurs when a milk duct does not drain properly and becomes inflamed, causing soreness, redness and sometimes a lump. Fever and flulike symptoms may be present as a result of the inflammation, but may also indicate the presence of an infection. Methods to relieve a plugged duct include increased breastfeeding on the affected side, locally applied heat, massage and rest. An antibiotic must be prescribed when an infection ensues because of a plugged duct that is not resolved within 24 hours by increased breastfeeding on the affected side.​[[52]](#psc1042n01131) Most antibiotics are safe to use during breastfeeding. Patients with recurrent mastitis should be referred to a breastfeeding expert.

Although there is some evidence that acupoint massage, breast massage and probiotics may prevent the development of mastitis, the overall quality of evidence is low.​[[53]](#Crepinsek2020)

### Principles of Drug and Natural Health Product Use during Breastfeeding

A patient may continue to breastfeed while on medication depending on whether the benefit of the medication outweighs the risk of the baby’s exposure to it. Most drugs are transferred to breast milk to some extent; however, drugs considered compatible with breastfeeding far outnumber those that are not.​[[54]](#psc1042n1043)​[[55]](#psc1042n1044)​[[56]](#psc1042n1046)

The texts *Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation* (Briggs and Freeman)​[[57]](#psc1042n1047) and *Medications and Mothers’ Milk* (Hale and Rowe)​[[58]](#psc1042n1048) are comprehensive sources of information on drugs and breastfeeding. Knowledge about safety of medications transferred from breast milk to baby is evolving. For a selection of reliable and authoritative web-based resources, see [Table 1](#psc1042n01086).

### Common Galactagogues

**Table 3:** Common Galactagogues

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Dopamine Receptor Antagonists**

| domperidone generics <$5 | 10 mg PO TID Do not exceed 30 mg daily Maximum effect on lactation typically reached within 7–14 days of therapy Some trials have studied duration of therapy up to 4 wk Gradual tapering off the dose is usually recommended | Breastfeeding Patient: Dry mouth, headache (resolved with decreased dosage), dizziness, abdominal cramping, GI upset. Some of these were more frequently reported in trials studying dosages greater than 30 mg daily. May increase the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death in patients who have a previous history of cardiac arrhythmias, high BMI , or risk factors for QTc prolongation including those taking QTc-prolonging drugs or CYP3A4 inhibitors, or exceeding 30 mg/day. Breastfed Infant: Transferred through breast milk in very low levels. No serious effects have been reported in breastfed infants; nonserious side effects were rare. | Increased blood levels of domperidone with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit juice, cannabinoids, antipsychotics, others) resulting in QTc prolongation; combination is contraindicated. Concomitant use of QTc-prolonging drugs has an additive effect on QTc prolongation; combination is contraindicated. Possible hypertensive crisis with MAOIs . | Requires a prescription. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of therapy necessary. Those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should not receive domperidone. The absolute risk increase of ventricular arrhythmias in this patient population is very low.​ [59] However, patients should be advised on this rare adverse effect and should be instructed to stop taking domperidone and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of abnormal heart rate or rhythm (i.e., palpitations, syncope). Psychiatric withdrawal events, such as depression, anxiety and insomnia, have been reported following sudden discontinuation or tapering of domperidone used for lactation stimulation. |
| metoclopromide generics <$5 | 10 mg PO TID–QID Some studies have used 5–15 mg PO TID with a total daily dose of 45 mg/day Duration of therapy in most studies is between 7 and 14 days Gradual tapering off the dose has been suggested by some studies | Breastfeeding Patient: May cause reversible CNS effects with short-term use including drowsiness (dose-related), fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression/agitation, motor restlessness, dystonic reactions and extrapyramidal symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be permanent if duration of therapy exceeds 5 days and >30 mg/day. Rare reports of usually irreversible tardive dyskinesia; the FDA has issued a black box warning for this on metoclopramide. Breastfed Infant: No serious effects have been reported when patients have used 45 mg daily or less, but many studies did not adequately observe for side effects. | Additive effects on sedation may result with concomitant use of CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, anxiolytics, opiates, sedatives). Concomitant use of antipsychotics may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Avoid combination use with nitrofurantoin, levodopa, dantrolene and anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine). | Requires a prescription. Transferred into breast milk in variable amounts. CNS side effects are more commonly seen with metoclopramide versus domperidone, as metoclopramide crosses the blood-brain barrier. Use caution when administering to patients with hypertension. |

**Drug Class: Natural Health Products**

| fenugreek various $5–10 | 570–600 mg TID Fenugreek seeds (one-quarter teaspoonful) may also be steeped in 200 mL of water for 10 min to produce a tea, of which the standard dose is 1 cup TID Usual duration of therapy is 1–3 wk, although reports exist of use up to 244 days starting 1–2 days after delivery | Generally well-tolerated; diarrhea (most common), flatulence, unusual body odour (maple syrup odour in urine). Some studies have reported nausea and vomiting in the breastfeeding patients and infant diarrhea in the breastfed baby. Risk of anaphylaxis due to cross-allergy with Asteraceae / Compositae family (e.g., ragweed and related plants), peanuts and Fabaceae family (e.g., chickpeas, soybeans, green peas). | Hawthorne, feverfew, primrose oil and other herbals with hypoglycemic potential (e.g., devil’s claw, ginseng) or those with platelet aggregation potential (e.g., ginger, ginkgo, turmeric, red clover) have been known to interact. Hypoglycemics (e.g., insulin), anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs and warfarin may have clinically significant interactions. | Active constituent: trigonelline, 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, sotolon. |
| silymarin various $5–10 | Micronized silymarin: 420 mg PO daily Silymarin-phosphatidylserine and galega: 5 g per day Anecdotal, strained tea: crushed seeds (one teaspoonful) may be steeped in 8 oz of water to produce a tea, of which the standard dose is 2–3 cups per day | Generally well-tolerated; occasional mild GI effect. Risk of anaphylaxis due to cross-allergy with Asteraceae / Compositae family (e.g., ragweed & related plants). | Concurrent use with CYP2C9 substrates may result in increased serum levels of the drugs. May increase serum levels of statins. May decrease serum estrogen levels. | Includes silymarin (micronized silymarin) or silybum marianum (milk thistle).

### Infant Formula

### Introduction

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Nutrition Products: Infant Formulas.

In both Canada and the United States, regulatory bodies are responsible for ensuring the safety and nutritional adequacy of infant formulas. In Canada, this responsibility lies with Health Canada under provision of the Canadian *Food and Drug Regulations*.

If the infant is not being breastfeed exclusively, commercial iron-fortified infant formulas are an acceptable alternative until 9–12 months of age. Indications for supplemental use of infant formula may include infant factors such hypoglycemia, weight loss that exceeds acceptable standards (typically 10%), stool patterns that suggest inadequacy of breastfeeding, or hyperbilirubinemia, and adult factors such as breast pathology or separation from the infant.​[[60]](#Kellams2017) In each of these cases, careful assessment is required, since supplementation may contribute to reduced overall duration of breastfeeding. Some individuals may choose not to breastfeed due to personal reasons or due to contraindications.

Most infant formulas are available as powder concentrate, liquid concentrate and/or ready-to-use varieties. Not all products are available in all forms. Powdered formulas tend to be more appealing, as they are less expensive than both liquid concentrate and ready-to-use forms. They are more portable than the liquid options, and the unreconstituted powder does not require refrigeration. Powder formulas are a convenient option for those who wish to supplement breastfeeding.

Once the can is opened, powdered formula can be used for up to 1 month as long as it is stored in a cool, dry place. It is usually reconstituted with 1 scoop (provided with each product) of powder to 60 mL of cooled boiled water or commercially prepared, sterilized water. Cold tap water should be boiled for at least 2–5 minutes.​[[61]](#psc1042n1049) If the formula will be fed immediately after preparation, it is safe to mix with cooled water that was previously boiled. However, if the formula is prepared in advance, it should be prepared with boiled water that is still very hot.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) Once formula made from powder has been reconstituted, it should be covered, refrigerated and used within 24 hours. Once a feeding has been started, the formula should be used within 2 hours or discarded.

Concerns have been raised regarding powdered infant formula and its relationship to a number of diseases including necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis.​[[62]](#psc1042n1050)​[[64]](#psc1042n1052) *Enterobacter sakazakii* outbreaks in infants have been linked to powdered infant formula and the equipment used to prepare it. As a result, regulatory bodies have issued warnings about the use of powdered infant formula, especially in immunocompromised infants and those born prematurely; liquid formulations are preferred for those infants.​[[63]](#HCPIF2018) It is important to emphasize that proper hygiene, preparation, use and storage of powdered infant formula minimizes the risks of acquiring *E. sakazakii*. Bottles, nipples, caps and any other mixing equipment should be boiled for at least 2 minutes and allowed to air dry and cool. See [How to Clean Equipment, Nipples and Soothers](#psc1042n01108) for more information on cleaning and sanitizing bottles.

Liquid concentrate formulas are sterile and require reconstitution with boiled or commercially prepared, sterilized water in a 1:1 ratio. Once a can of liquid concentrate is opened, it must be refrigerated and used within 48 hours. Once mixed with water, the reconstituted formula must be used within 24 hours.

Ready-to-use infant formula is sterile and does not require mixing or the availability of a clean water supply. Although convenient for the occasional bottle, it is expensive for daily routine feeding.

Infant formulas can be used as a sole source of nutrition or as a supplement to human milk feeding. In general, commercial infant formulas contain 0.67 kcal/mL with 40–45% of calories from carbohydrate, 8–12% of calories from protein and approximately 45–50% of calories from fat. Both micro- and macronutrient content differ slightly between products but all are designed to mimic human milk as closely as possible.

### Cow’s Milk–Based Formulas

Cow’s milk–based formulas are the most commonly used substitution or supplement to breast milk.

The protein content of these formulas is higher than that of breast milk and can vary in the proportion of the common protein components, whey and casein. Most formula manufacturers try to have the ratio of whey to casein resemble that of human milk as much as possible. When acidified, whey proteins remain in solution whereas casein proteins precipitate into curds. Whey-based formulas may accelerate gastric emptying faster than casein-predominant formulas and may be associated with fewer episodes of emesis or gastroesophageal reflux.​[[65]](#psc1042n1053) The carbohydrate source of standard cow’s milk–based formula is either lactose, the carbohydrate found in human milk, or a combination of lactose and maltodextrin. Maltodextrins are easily digestible polysaccharides produced from the hydrolysis of starch.

Standard-term formulas (for healthy-term infants) usually contain a combination of vegetable oils, including palm, coconut, soy, sunflower and safflower. Approximately 50% of the energy contained in a standard-term formula is derived from fat. Although these formulas do contain the essential fatty acids linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, the fat blends used in commercially available formulas are different from those found in human milk. Arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been added to some infant formulas, as a few studies suggest that they may improve short-term visual and cognitive function, although the body of evidence is inconclusive.​[[7]](#psc1042n1006)​[[66]](#psc1042n1054)​[[67]](#Jasani2017) Similarly, some cow’s milk–based formulas contain probiotics, which are thought to play a potential role in reducing the risk of eczema, but the evidence is inconclusive.​[[68]](#Osborn2017) There is controversy over the optimal iron concentration in infant formula;​[[69]](#Domellof2014) most standard formulas contain 12 mg/L, but some contain lower iron concentrations.

### Lactose-Free Cow’s Milk–Based Formulas

As the name suggests, in these formulas the milk sugar lactose is replaced with either corn syrup solids or maltodextrin and sucrose. The protein source remains as cow’s milk–based protein. Caregivers may purchase a lactose-free formula if they suspect that symptoms of gassiness or fussiness in infancy are related to the lactose content of the formula. Some caregivers may select this formula after a bout of infant diarrhea where there may be a temporary, secondary disaccharidase deficiency.​[[70]](#MacGillivray2013) Lactose-free formulas may contain residual amounts of lactose and galactose, which makes them an inappropriate formula choice for infants with galactosemia.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) For infants with this condition, see [Soy Protein Isolate–Based Formulas](#psc1042n01091).

Lactose has an important role in mineral absorption and nonpathogenic bacterial colonization of the GI tract. Therefore, a decision to switch to a lactose-free formula should be made with careful consideration of the risks and benefits.

### Soy Protein Isolate–Based Formulas

Soy-based formulas are free of cow’s milk protein and lactose. They are iron-fortified and are designed to meet the nutritional needs of term-born infants. The protein fraction of these formulas is composed of soy protein isolate. Starch, corn syrup solids, corn maltodextrin and sucrose form the carbohydrate fraction. The fat blend is the same as the cow’s milk–based product of that particular brand. Minerals are added in greater concentration than in cow’s milk–based formula, as mineral bioavailability is reduced by the presence of phytates in the soy protein isolate.

Soy protein formulas are recommended for term infants with galactosemia or congenital lactase deficiency. They can be used as a supplement to breastfeeding for infants of breastfeeding individuals who follow a vegetarian diet or those who wish to feed the infant a nonanimal protein-based formula. They are not recommended for infants with cow’s milk protein–induced enteropathy or enterocolitis, as 30–60% will also be sensitive to soy. However, infants who have an immunoglobulin E–associated reaction to cow’s milk protein may tolerate soy formulas.​[[71]](#psc1042n1055)

Soy formulas contain soy isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens that have been linked to reduced reproductive function. However, soy formulas appear to lead to comparable growth in the infant compared to cow’s milk formula, and an expert panel concluded that there is minimal risk of adverse effects on development.​[[72]](#McCarver2011)

The cost of soy protein formulas is comparable to that of milk-based formulas.

### Hydrolyzed Protein Formulas

Hydrolyzed formulas available in Canada can be either partially or extensively hydrolyzed. The 2 types cannot be used interchangeably.

Partially hydrolyzed whey formulas contain lactose and are less expensive and more palatable than extensively hydrolyzed protein–containing formulas. Partially hydrolyzed formulas are used commonly as a substitute for or supplement to breast milk. The perceived benefits of partially hydrolyzed whey formulas, such as fewer spitting-up episodes and softer stools, are likely related to the beta-lactoglobulin (which remains soluble in the stomach) moving faster to the upper jejunum.​[[73]](#MeyerRFoongRXThaparNEtAl.Systematic-07DF30B0) These benefits may be more pronounced in children with underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Extensively hydrolyzed protein–containing formulas contain casein proteins that have been heat-treated and enzymatically hydrolyzed into peptide chains and free amino acids. They are recommended for infants with intolerance to intact cow’s milk protein and soy protein.​[[74]](#psc1042n1056) They contain either long-chain triglycerides or a mixture of both long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides. The advantages of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) in these formulas are their ability to bypass the lymphatic system and their requirement for less pancreatic enzymes and bile salts for digestion and absorption. Extensively hydrolyzed formulations benefit infants with malabsorptive diseases such as short bowel syndrome, liver disease, cystic fibrosis and intractable diarrhea.​[[7]](#psc1042n1006) Infants with cholestasis and lymphangiectasia also benefit from extensively hydrolyzed formulations, especially those containing a higher percentage of MCT. Extensively hydrolyzed protein–containing formulas are lactose-free, and the carbohydrate is usually corn syrup solids, cornstarch and occasionally sucrose. These formulas are more expensive and less palatable than milk-based formulas.

While it was once thought that extensively hydrolyzed protein formula may delay or prevent the occurrence of allergic or atopic disease in infants who cannot exclusively breastfeed and who are at high risk of these disease, this practice does not appear to result in any differences in childhood allergic or atopic diseases.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)​[[74]](#psc1042n1056)​[[75]](#OsbornDASinnJ.FormulasContainingHyd-01134DF8)

### Amino Acid–Based Formulas

Amino acid–based formulas, also known as “elemental” formulas, contain 100% free amino acids. They are designed for infants with severe milk protein hypersensitivity and are also used for infants with malabsorption-associated diseases who have persistent symptoms when receiving a partially hydrolyzed formula. These formulas are lactose-free and usually contain a combination of long- and medium-chain triglycerides. Amino acid–based formulas are more expensive than hydrolyzed formulas and are equally unpalatable.

### Pre-thickened Formulas

Commercially available pre-thickened formulas for the treatment of regurgitation and vomiting offer advantages over standard formulas thickened with cornstarch or rice cereal. When standard formulas are thickened with infant cereal or cornstarch, nutrients and fluids are displaced; this practice is not recommended. The nutrient composition of pre-thickened formulas more closely resembles that of standard formula. The use of feed thickeners or pre-thickened formula may reduce regurgitation by around 2 episodes per day.​[[76]](#kwok2017)

### Follow-up Formulas

Follow-up formulas are designed for infants between 6 and 24 months of age who are consuming some complementary foods. They are usually less expensive than starter formulas and contain higher amounts of protein, vitamins and minerals. There does not appear to be superior health benefits to using follow-up formulas compared with starter formulas. Additionally, they may deter caregivers from the early introduction of unmodified cow’s milk.

The Canadian Paediatric Society suggests that there is no indication for using infant formula beyond 1 year of age for most healthy children. Pasteurized cow’s milk can be used instead. However, if additional caloric density is required to support growth (e.g., if the child is not growing as expected), formula can be used in place of cow’s milk, but should be offered after meals rather than as a replacement.​[[77]](#CPS6to24)​[[78]](#CPSgrowthchart)

### Formulas for Premature Infants

These formulas are designed to meet the accelerated growth needs of infants born prematurely. They are available in sterile, ready-to-use form and are available only in a hospital setting. These formulations are available as standard and higher energy (0.67 kcal/mL and 0.8 kcal/mL); nutrient-enriched formulas may increase the rate of weight gain in premature infants.​[[79]](#Walsh2019) The protein, vitamins and minerals are also present in higher amounts than term formula in order to support third-trimester growth. Premature formulas contain fat blends of 40–50% MCT to improve digestion and absorption in immature GI tracts. The fatty acids DHA and ARA have been added to all premature formulas in North America based on limited research suggesting that there are visual, cognitive and other developmental advantages to supplementing premature formulas, although the evidence is inconclusive.​[[80]](#psc1042n1057)​[[81]](#psc1042n1058)​[[82]](#Moon2016) Because of the immaturity of the GI tract and lower amount of lactase enzyme, glucose polymers replace some of the lactose in the carbohydrate portion of these formulas.

### Postdischarge Formulas for Preterm Infants

The unique nutritional needs of preterm infants do not end when they reach term age. Many preterm infants remain undergrown compared with their term-born counterparts. Postdischarge formulas for preterm infants are designed to provide the additional energy, protein and other nutrients necessary for catch-up growth. Preterm infants fed a postdischarge formula up to 9 months post-term have higher weights and lengths compared with preterm infants fed standard-term formula.​[[83]](#psc1042n1059) However, little evidence supports using these formulas beyond 9 months post-term. At standard dilution, these formulas provide 0.74 kcal/mL.

. . . . .

### Other Considerations

### Alternative Milks and Beverages

Unmodified cow’s milk (3.25%, 2%, 1% or skim) and evaporated cow’s milk are not recommended during the first 9–12 months of life. Once introduced, only whole cow’s milk (3.25%) should be used until the age of 2 years.​[[84]](#NutritionForHealthyTermInfantsRecom-00A3ACE0) Cow’s milk contains much higher protein content than human milk and limited amounts of the essential fatty acids linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. In addition, the renal solute load is higher than that of human milk due to significantly higher mineral and protein concentrations. This puts a greater stress on the kidneys, especially if the infant has any illness that will increase insensible water loss. Unmodified cow’s milk is also associated with increased blood loss through the GI tract. This blood loss, in addition to the low concentration and bioavailability of iron in unmodified cow’s milk, may predispose the infant to iron-deficiency anemia.​[[7]](#psc1042n1006) For more information regarding iron supplementation, see [Vitamins and Minerals](#psc1042n01103).

Pasteurized and unpasteurized goat’s milk, soy beverages, rice beverages or other vegetarian beverages are not considered complete nutritional alternatives to breast milk or commercial infant formula.

Water and juice are not necessary for breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life and may displace nutrient-rich human milk and introduce contaminants and potential allergens. Infants older than 6 months of age should be offered water if they are thirsty. Sweetened beverages are not encouraged; if consumed, they should be limited to 125–175 mL per day.​[[84]](#NutritionForHealthyTermInfantsRecom-00A3ACE0) Carbonated beverages are not recommended for infants because they contain few nutrients and may contain caffeine and excess sugar, exposing infants to an unnecessary stimulant and predisposing them to dental caries. As well, carbonated beverages may interfere with the intake of more nutrient-rich foods. Sports drinks are not recommended for infants because of their high sugar content and lack of other nutrients. There is a lack of evidence to support the safe use of herbal teas and drinks in infants and therefore they are not recommended.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)

### Complementary Foods for Babies Older than 6 Months of Age

Exclusive breastfeeding or an iron-enriched commercial term formula is sufficient to support growth and development during the first 6 months of life.​[[3]](#psc1042n1003) The introduction of complementary foods before 6 months of age provides no advantage to energy intake or rate of growth and may displace the intake of human milk or result in less milk production in the breastfeeding adult.​[[85]](#Verga2022) Furthermore, any increase in the duration of sleep during the night is uncertain and likely to be minimal.​[[86]](#Fu2021)​[[87]](#Perkin2018) Usually around 6 months of age, when an infant has good head and neck control and shows signs of readiness such as an interest in food when others are eating, iron-rich foods can be introduced gradually.

In Canada, the most common “first food” is iron-fortified infant cereal. However, other iron-containing foods (e.g., meats, eggs, tofu and legumes) can be introduced first at this stage and will vary depending on family and culture.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) Once iron-rich foods are introduced, there is no specific order in which to introduce the infant to fruits, vegetables and dairy products.​[[84]](#NutritionForHealthyTermInfantsRecom-00A3ACE0) Initially, foods are introduced in a puréed consistency, but as the child becomes more mature and confident with new foods, different safe textures should be progressively introduced until the child is eating a varied diet by the age of 1 year (see [Table 3](#psc1042n01116)).

Baby-led weaning has emerged as an alternate approach for the introduction of complementary foods. Using this approach, infants feed themselves from the beginning, starting with soft finger foods (e.g., banana slices, avocado, soft-cooked vegetables, egg yolk). While baby-led weaning is proposed to promote self-regulation, appropriate weight gain and greater food acceptance, evidence is limited to support the widespread use of baby-led weaning at this time.​[[88]](#Taylor2017)​[[89]](#Brown2017)

Common food allergens (e.g., egg, fish, peanut, wheat, soy) should be introduced when other complementary foods are introduced; waiting beyond 6 months of age is not recommended and may even increase the risk of developing such allergies.​[[90]](#ChanESCummingsCAtkinsonAEtAl.Dietar-00A57CCC) Once a potential allergen has been introduced, it should be regularly fed to the infant several times per week.​[[90]](#ChanESCummingsCAtkinsonAEtAl.Dietar-00A57CCC) Caregivers should avoid introducing more than 1 common allergen per day, and should separate the introduction of different allergens by at least 2 days.​[[84]](#NutritionForHealthyTermInfantsRecom-00A3ACE0) For more information regarding food allergy in infants, see [Food Allergy](#psc1042n01105).

Consider the safety of infants when offering complementary foods. While finger foods are encouraged to promote self-feeding, they should have a low choking risk (e.g., soft fruits and vegetables, grated cheese, ground meat and toast).​[[84]](#NutritionForHealthyTermInfantsRecom-00A3ACE0) Avoid hard, small, round and sticky solid foods; raw and undercooked meats and eggs; and unpasteurized dairy products and juices. Also avoid honey in children under 1 year of age due to the risk of botulism. Infant consumption of rice products, including infant cereals and toddler snacks, has been associated with arsenic exposure that exceeds standard recommendations.​[[91]](#KaragasMRPunshonTSayarathVEtAl.Asso-0B6B3F28) Although the health implications of increased arsenic exposure are unknown, strategies to limit infants’ exposure may be appropriate; these include feeding with other iron-rich foods and supplementing the infant’s diet with a variety of grains.

**Table 2:** Infant Feeding Guide

### Vitamins and Minerals

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Human milk contains small amounts of vitamin D, but not enough to prevent rickets. With decreased sun exposure, either through the use of sunscreen or coverage of the skin with hats and clothing, the usual mechanism of vitamin D production is hindered. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends assessing every breastfeeding individual-infant dyad for risk of vitamin D deficiency.​[[92]](#CPSvitaminDD) Patients with darker skin pigmentation, lower socioeconomic conditions or living in northern communities with less sunlight exposure may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.​[[93]](#psc1042n1064) Particular attention should be given to breastfed Indigenous infants living in northern communities, as they are disproportionately impacted by severe vitamin D deficiency, often due to limited access to social determinants of health. All fully and partially breastfed babies require a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day, not to exceed 1000 IU/day.​[[94]](#psc1042n1065)​[[95]](#psc1042n1066) Vitamin D supplementation should continue until 1 year of age. Exclusively formula-fed babies may not require additional vitamin D.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)

Children younger than 3 years of age should be assessed by a health-care professional to determine if they are at risk of developing dental caries; if this is found to be the case, use of a fluoridated dentifrice may be appropriate.​[[96]](#psc1042n1067) For more information see Oral Hygiene, Dental Plaque and Caries.

Healthy, full-term, breastfed infants do not need extra iron until 6 months of age, at which time the iron in complementary foods provides appropriate intake.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)​[[97]](#psc1042n1020)​[[98]](#psc1042n1021) Healthy, full-term infants who are not breastfed will receive adequate iron through iron-fortified infant formula. Infants at risk of iron deficiency include those with a low birth weight, premature infants, those born to iron-deficient patients, and infants older than 6 months who drink breast milk or an excessive amount of cow’s milk without an adequate supply of iron-rich foods.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) Symptoms of iron deficiency include pallor, irritability, poor appetite, and delayed growth and development. If iron deficiency is suspected, the infant should be screened and given supplementation accordingly.

For more information about Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) of vitamins and minerals for infants and young children, see Nutritional Supplements.

### Infant Colic

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Baby Care Products:Gastrointestinal.

Infant colic is defined as recurrent and prolonged periods of fussiness or crying without apparent cause or failure to thrive.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001)​[[99]](#Benninga2016) Possible causes include immaturity of gut function, altered visceral perception or, rarely, cow’s milk allergy. Although foods consumed by those who are breastfeeding may appear in the breast milk, colic in the baby is seldom the result of the adult’s diet. Therefore, feeding changes (e.g., interrupting breastfeeding, supplementing with formula, restricting the diet of the person breastfeeding) are not an effective means to manage infant colic. More specifically, restricting the intake of cow’s milk in those who are breastfeeding, although recommended by guidelines, is not supported by evidence.​[[100]](#Munblit2020) Similarly there is also limited evidence to support changing formula to alleviate infant colic.​[[101]](#Gordon2018)

Breastfed babies may be fussy for a number of other reasons, such as hunger, the need to be near their caregiver, an oversupply of breast milk or an overactive milk ejection reflex. Oversupply or overactive ejection reflex occur when there is a generous milk supply and the baby gets an overabundance of foremilk (higher in lactose) that overwhelms the intestinal lactase. Consider this condition if a thriving infant presents with excessive crying; gas; and explosive, loose, watery stools. A breastfeeding expert can provide management techniques. This is not an indication for use of lactose-free infant formula.

For more information regarding infant colic, see Infant Colic.

### Gastroesophageal Reflux in Healthy Infants

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in healthy infants is a normal physiologic occurrence. Most GER episodes cause few symptoms, and infants gain weight and grow out of their symptoms without the need for treatment. However, a subset of infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) require more aggressive treatment, often as a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Rarely are the symptoms of reflux so severe that breastfeeding should be discontinued.​[[102]](#psc1042n1062) However, if regurgitation and vomiting persist for more than 1 month in formula-fed infants, the use of thickened feeds, or the switch to an extensively hydrolyzed formula or an amino acid–based formula may be warranted.​[[102]](#psc1042n1062)

### Constipation

Stool patterns in childhood vary, ranging from several times per day to once every 3–4 days.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) True constipation during infancy is rare. When introducing complementary foods such as rice cereal, stool patterns may change temporarily. Careful attention should be paid to fluid intake to reduce the incidence of hard, painful bowel movements. For infants older than 6 months of age, the use of prune juice and the addition of whole grain cereal, cooked legumes, and fruits and vegetables into the diet may be helpful. There are no dietary fibre recommendations for children under 1 year of age. Recommendations do exist for children over 1 year of age​[[103]](#psc1042n1068)​[[104]](#HCDRI) but are not based on evidence of disease prevention.​[[1]](#psc1042n1001) For more information, see Constipation.

### Food Allergy

Food allergy is an adverse reaction that develops after an offending food or ingredient is eaten. A true food allergy is an immunologically mediated adverse reaction, which is different from a “food intolerance” (a reaction not mediated by the immune system).​[[105]](#psc1042n1069) Milk, egg and peanut are the most common food allergies in infancy followed by soy, nuts and wheat. Many food allergies resolve spontaneously with age but peanut, tree nut and seafood allergies are less likely to do so. In the majority of children, allergies to milk, egg, soy and wheat resolve by school age.

Early introduction of peanut-containing foods (4–11 months) may lower the risk of developing peanut allergy.​[[106]](#IerodiakonouJAMA2016) In infants at high risk of developing peanut allergy (i.e., infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy), introduction of peanut-containing foods (6–7 g peanut protein per week, equivalent to 2 teaspoons of peanut butter 3 times a week) significantly reduced the risk of developing peanut allergy.​[[108]](#DuTOITNEJMA2015) Consider measuring serum peanut-specific IgE in high-risk infants and, based on test results, introducing peanut-containing foods at 4–6 months of age.​[[108]](#DuTOITNEJMA2015) In infants at moderate risk of peanut allergy (i.e., infants with mild to moderate eczema), consider introducing peanut-containing foods around 6 months of age.​[[109]](#Togias2017) Peanut-containing foods can be introduced in accordance with family and cultural preferences in infants at low risk of developing peanut allergy.​[[109]](#Togias2017) Once peanut-containing foods have been introduced to the infant’s diet, they should be regularly fed to the infant several times per week. Whole peanuts and peanut butter directly from a spoon present a choking hazard. Peanut butter can be thinned with warm water or mixed with puréed tolerated fruits or vegetables.

Early introduction of egg-containing food (4–6 months of age) is also associated with a lower risk of developing egg allergy in high-risk infants.​[[106]](#IerodiakonouJAMA2016)​[[107]](#Perkin2019) It is yet unclear whether a similar association exists between timing of introduction and subsequent risk of allergy development to milk, fish or wheat.​[[110]](#PerkinNEJM2016) Interestingly, a study conducted in Japan suggests that very early introduction of cow’s milk–based formula (within the first 3 days of life) increases risk of sensitization to cow’s milk and food allergy.​[[111]](#Urashima2019) More research is needed, however, to confirm such findings.

If food allergy develops, the most effective way to manage it is through avoidance of the offending food.​[[105]](#psc1042n1069) In exclusively breastfed infants, elimination of the offending protein from the diet of the person breastfeeding is no longer considered a first-line measure to reduce the likelihood of sensitization, except if the allergen is peanut.​[[74]](#psc1042n1056) If allergy is suspected, the person may continue to breastfeed unless the symptoms are bothersome or affect the baby, e.g., skin rash, runny nose, diarrhea. If allergies persist, the recommended treatment is to use a formula containing hydrolyzed proteins. In infants who continue to be symptomatic, an elemental amino acid–based formula is the only alternative.​[[112]](#psc1042n1070) For more information on these types of formulas, see [Hydrolyzed Protein Formulas](#psc1042n01092) and [Amino Acid–Based Formulas](#psc1042n01093). For more information regarding the introduction of solid foods and food allergy prevention, see [Complementary Foods for Babies Older than 6 Months of Age](#psc1042n01102).
