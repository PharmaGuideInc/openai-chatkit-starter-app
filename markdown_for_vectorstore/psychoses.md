### Introduction

Psychoses are brain disorders that cause a distortion of, or loss of contact with, reality and affect a patient’s ability to think, feel, perceive and act. Psychotic symptoms include the following:

- Positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, speech and behaviour
- Negative symptoms such as social withdrawal, apathy, anhedonia and emotional blunting
- Cognitive symptoms such as impaired attention, concentration and memory
- Mood symptoms such as dysphoria, anxiety and emotional lability

Approximately 3% of people worldwide will experience at least 1 psychotic episode during their lifetime. See [Table 1](#c0122n00010) for a list of differential diagnoses. As symptoms can evolve during the early phase of illness, consider the initial diagnosis provisional, and re-evaluate as the disease progresses.

The age of onset of schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders is usually late adolescence/early adulthood. There is increased emphasis on earlier detection and intervention​[[1]](#CorrellCUGallingBPawarAEtAl.Compari-0CD45F62) because the duration of untreated psychosis can be associated with poorer outcomes in both the short and long term.​[[2]](#c0122n00381)​[[3]](#c0122n00204)

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Episodes​[[4]](#c0122n00202)

| Disorder | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Schizophrenia | Signs of illness for ≥6 months ; psychotic symptoms (delusions and/or hallucinations and/or disorganized speech) for ≥1 month ; social/occupational dysfunction |
| Schizophreniform disorder | Similar to schizophrenia except duration of illness <6 months and ≥1 month |
| Schizoaffective disorder | Uninterrupted period of illness in which symptoms of schizophrenia and major mood episode occur concurrently; during lifetime duration of illness, ≥2 wk of delusions or hallucinations in absence of major mood episode; major mood episode is present >50% of total duration of illness |
| Delusional disorder | Nonbizarre delusions for ≥1 month and patient does not meet criteria for schizophrenia |
| Brief psychotic disorder | Psychotic symptoms for ≥1 day but <1 month ; may or may not be related to marked stressor; eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning |
| Substance-induced psychotic disorder | Delusions or hallucinations develop during or within 1 month of substance intoxication or withdrawal or are etiologically related to medication use and are not better accounted for by another psychotic disorder |
| Psychotic disorder associated with another medical condition | Delusions or hallucinations are a direct physiological consequence of a medical condition and occur in absence of delirium |
| Major depression or bipolar disorder with psychotic features | Delusions or hallucinations occur during a major depressive or manic episode |
| Psychotic disorder not elsewhere classified | Psychotic symptoms present but criteria for specific disorder not met or there is insufficient or contradictory information |

### Prevention

Increasingly, research has focused on the identification and treatment of individuals who are at “clinical high risk” of developing a psychotic disorder or may be in the prodromal phase.​[[5]](#c0122n00382)​[[6]](#c0122n00383)​[[7]](#c0122n00384)

Primary care providers can play an important role in early detection.​[[8]](#c0122n00386)​[[9]](#c0122n00387) A number of tools, including structured interviews and rating scales, have been developed to identify individuals who may meet the criteria for being at clinical high risk of progressing to a psychotic disorder.​[[10]](#MillerTJMcGlashanTHRosenJLEtAl.Prod-AF36814F) Examples include the [Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education (PRIME) screening test](http://www.schizophrenia.com/sztest/primetest.pdf); the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS); and the Scale of Prodromal Syndromes (SOPS).

Common prodromal psychosis symptoms (in order of decreasing frequency) include:​[[11]](#c0122n00018)

- Reduced concentration and attention
- Reduced drive and motivation; lack of energy
- Depressed mood
- Sleep disturbance
- Anxiety
- Social withdrawal
- Deterioration in functioning
- Irritability

The primary goal of treatment for individuals who meet the criteria for a prodromal psychosis syndrome is to prevent the progression to psychosis and to alleviate current and distressing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Canadian schizophrenia guidelines recommend a staged approach, beginning with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and progressing to low-dose second-generation antipsychotics for those who do not respond to psychological interventions.​[[12]](#AddingtonJAddingtonDAbidiSEtAl.Cana-0CD55E6F) For more information on treatment options, see [Therapeutic Choices](#c0122n00014).

If an individual is deemed to be at clinical high risk of developing a psychotic disorder or may be in the prodromal phase, referral to a specialized [early psychosis program](http://www.schizophrenia.com/earlypsychosis.htm) (if available), psychiatrist or community mental health team is recommended. The [Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis](http://epicanada.org/), a national and bilingual organization of clinicians who are involved with early psychosis programs across Canada, also provides access to various tools and resources.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent progression to psychosis in patients at clinical high risk
- Reduce psychotic agitation in acute episodes
- Achieve remission of positive, negative, mood and cognitive symptoms
- Reduce risk of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly suicide and depression
- Reduce risk of physical comorbidity including metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease
- Reduce risk of substance abuse
- Reduce risk of harm to self and others
- Reduce risk of social isolation due to alienation from family, friends and social supports
- Facilitate recovery of functioning and healthy development
- Prevent or minimize recurrence of psychotic episodes

### Investigations

- Family physicians are often the initial contact for patients experiencing a first psychotic episode. They should have a high index of suspicion in any young individual who is experiencing persistent changes in behaviour, mood and functioning, especially in the presence of other risk factors, such as:
  - substance abuse
  - family history of mental illness, particularly a history of psychotic disorders
  - childhood trauma
  - obstetrical complications at birth (e.g., extreme prematurity, hypoxia/ischemia)
- Individuals with suspected first-episode psychosis require urgent services. If available, refer to a psychiatrist, community mental-health clinic or specialized early psychosis program.​[[13]](#AddingtonDAbidiSGarcia-OrtegaEtAl.C-0CDB005D)
- In addition to the common prodromal symptoms previously discussed, signs and symptoms of possible first-episode psychosis include:​[[11]](#c0122n00018)

  - rapid fluctuations in mood (emotional lability) or showing very little emotion or facial expression
  - unreasonable suspiciousness
  - insomnia, restlessness and pacing at night
  - unusual or bizarre behaviour
  - unusual perceptual experiences including hypersensitivity, illusions and/or brief intermittent hallucinations
  - difficulties in thinking, such as organizing and/or expressing thoughts
- Substance use (particularly cannabis) is common in first-episode psychosis. Individuals may therefore be misdiagnosed with a substance-induced psychosis and not receive appropriate ongoing treatment. Cannabis use can trigger the onset of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in genetically vulnerable individuals​[[14]](#c0122n00208) and in individuals with schizotypal disorder.​[[15]](#HjorthojCAlbertNNordentoftM.Associa-0CD71919) See [Substance Abuse](#c0122n00024) for more information.
- A high index of suspicion for a functional psychosis (not substance-induced) is warranted, even in the presence of substance use, if:

  - symptoms precede the onset of substance use
  - symptoms are bizarre or there is marked thought disorder
  - symptoms persist beyond the period of intoxication or withdrawal
- In an acute psychotic episode, assess the nature and extent of psychopathology:

  - thorough history of presenting problems with special attention to onset and course of prodromal symptoms
  - onset, characteristics and severity of psychotic symptoms
  - changes in behaviour and functioning
  - history of any suicidal ideation or behaviour and/or aggressive/violent ideation or behaviour
  - history of substance use/abuse in relation to onset and course of psychotic symptoms
- A thorough mental status examination is essential. Competency to consent to treatment needs to be assessed in all acutely psychotic individuals.
- Obtain information from as many sources as possible, since individuals with psychotic disorders are often poor historians. Interview family members whenever possible with the consent of the individual. If a patient is unwilling to give consent to interview family members, a clinician may still accept collateral information provided by a family member (e.g., in a phone call) but cannot divulge any information that would constitute a breach of patient confidentiality. If a patient is judged unable to give informed consent, then legally a substitute decision-maker (usually a family member) has to be contacted in order to provide informed consent on behalf of the patient.
- A variety of clinical rating scales can be used at baseline and repeated periodically to monitor for symptomatic and functional recovery following an acute psychotic episode:

  - The Clinical Global Impression Scales for Severity (CGI-S)​[[16]](#c0122n00243) and for Change (CGI-C)​[[16]](#c0122n00243) and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)​[[17]](#SmithGNEhmannTSFlynnSWEtAl.Thexa0as-CA709855) for documenting changes over time are easy to use.
  - Training is required in order to reliably use the [Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale](http://www.priory.com/psych/bprs.htm) (BPRS, available at www.priory.com/psych/bprs.htm) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Alternatively, the semistructured interview guide SCI-PANSS​[[18]](#c0122n00200) takes approximately 30–40 minutes to complete and can be helpful in eliciting signs and symptoms of psychopathology.
- Patients with only partial symptomatic and/or functional recovery following an acute psychotic episode require diagnostic reassessment by a psychiatrist.
- Appropriate investigations, based on both the phase of the psychotic disorder and individual patient characteristics, are listed in [Table 2](#c0122n00013).

### Therapeutic Choices

- Patients capable of providing informed consent should be involved in treatment decision-making.​[[13]](#AddingtonDAbidiSGarcia-OrtegaEtAl.C-0CDB005D)
- Antipsychotic medications are considered the most effective treatment option for patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders,​[[21]](#c0122n00199)​[[22]](#c0122n00198) but antipsychotic agents need to be integrated with psychosocial interventions to optimize outcomes.​[[23]](#NormanRLecomteTAddingtonDEtAl.Canad-0CDF2EFE)
- Both pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions should be tailored to the individual, based on phase of illness, severity of symptoms, past history of treatment response (if applicable), degree of insight and acceptance of treatment, presence of comorbid psychiatric/physical disorders, and family medical/psychiatric history.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### First Episode/Recurrent Acute Episode

- Determine appropriate treatment setting (least restrictive setting possible), ensure safety, and reduce environmental stressors and stimuli.
- Acutely agitated patients and those at imminent risk of harm to self or others will require hospitalization, if necessary, on an involuntary basis. Criteria for involuntary psychiatric assessment and/or admission are determined by each province’s mental-health legislation.
- See patient frequently (for outpatients at least weekly for first 4–6 weeks) in order to:

  - build rapport
  - provide support, practical advice and psychoeducation
  - promote medication adherence
  - monitor treatment response (both adverse effects and improvement in symptoms)
- Foster a collaborative, therapeutic relationship between the patient, family/caregivers and treatment team.

### Stabilization/Stable Phases​[[24]](#APAPracticeGuidelines)

- In schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, recovery (stabilization phase) from an acute psychotic episode usually occurs over 6 months but may take longer and may be incomplete. Focus should be on medication adherence, stress management, assessment of signs and symptoms of postpsychotic depression and suicidality, assessment of substance use, and education about early warning signs of relapse.
- Psychosocial interventions are an essential component of treatment in all phases of illness. Individual and family psychoeducation, CBT, motivational interviewing, social and vocational skills training, supported employment programs, and peer support groups have been shown to improve functional outcome and community reintegration, promote treatment adherence, and help prevent relapse.​[[23]](#NormanRLecomteTAddingtonDEtAl.Canad-0CDF2EFE)​[[25]](#BighelliIRodolicoAGarcia-MieresHEtA-85842E13) Furthermore, CBT may be effective in treating residual psychotic symptoms as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety.​[[26]](#PsychosisAndSchizophreniaInAdultsTr-CA78DE77)
- Counselling regarding healthy diet and exercise may be helpful in preventing and/or managing antipsychotic side effects.​[[20]](#PringsheimTKellyMUrnessDEtAl.Physic-0CDE6DE3)
- Exercise and tai chi may reduce symptoms and improve motor coordination and memory.​[[27]](#HoRTFongTCWanAHEtAl.ARandomizedCont-AF399090)
- Individuals with serious, ongoing illness and functional disability or comorbid problems such as substance abuse may benefit from referral to an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team, if available.​[[28]](#CrockfordDAddingtonD.CanadianSchizo-0D209168)
- Maintain continuity of care with an individual clinician or multidisciplinary treatment team.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Choice of Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are effective in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.​[[29]](#CerasoALinJJSchneider-ThomaJEtAl.Ma-85859BB6) Two major classes of antipsychotics are currently available in Canada: first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs).

- All FGAs and SGAs, with the exception of clozapine, have similar efficacy in treating the positive (psychotic) symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders, and may be considered as initial treatment options;​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7) choice should be guided by tolerability and adverse reaction profile. SGAs are typically considered first due to more favourable tolerability. While some studies have found that SGAs may have advantages in first-episode psychosis​[[31]](#c0122n00196)​[[32]](#c0122n00195) (improving negative symptoms, mood and cognitive deficits​[[33]](#c0122n00194)​[[34]](#c0122n00193) and in preventing relapse​[[35]](#c0122n00192) and rehospitalization), overall the results have been mixed and greater efficacy for SGAs has not been consistently demonstrated.​[[36]](#Schneider-ThomaJChalkouKDorriesCEtA-8589541F)​[[37]](#c0122n00191) No differences in effect on quality of life have been found between FGAs and SGAs.​[[38]](#JonesPBBarnesTRDaviesLEtAl.Randomiz-AF419FD7)
- FGAs, also known as “typical” or “conventional” antipsychotics, can be classified according to their chemical structure (e.g., phenothiazines such as fluphenazine or butyrophenones such as haloperidol) or potency (low, intermediate, high) as determined by dopamine D2-receptor binding affinity. When comparing low, intermediate and high-potency agents, differences in side effect profiles are observed (see [Table 3](#29C213DD) and [Table 6](#c0122n00117)):

  - low-potency agents (e.g., chlorpromazine, methotrimeprazine) have greater rates of sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects and weight gain
  - intermediate-potency agents (e.g., loxapine, perphenazine and zuclopenthixol)
  - high-potency agents (e.g., fluphenazine, haloperidol) have greater rates of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) (e.g., parkinsonism, tardive movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and elevated prolactin levels
- SGAs or “atypical” antipsychotics (aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone) have greater 5HT2A affinity relative to D2 affinity. The duration of binding to D2 receptors and differences in binding affinity to other neurotransmitters (serotonergic, muscarinic, histaminic, alpha-adrenergic) may account for clinical differences in dosing requirements and side effect profiles among SGAs (see [Table 3](#29C213DD), [Table 4](#29A3DF80) and [Table 7](#c0122n00037)).​[[39]](#c0122n00197) Some experts have further classified aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine as third-generation antipsychotics due to their unique property of partial dopamine agonism and potential for treating negative symptoms; by having an affinity to dopamine receptors that is lower than endogenous dopamine, they have overall antagonist effects. Asenapine, lurasidone, paliperidone and ziprasidone also have slightly different binding affinities compared with other SGAs; see [Table 7](#c0122n00037) for more information.

**Table 3:** Basic Pharmacology of Antipsychotics​[[40]](#c0122n00168)[[41]](#MiyamotoSMiyakeNJarskogLFEtAl.Pharm-A6EB7A5E)

| Receptor Antagonized | Clinical Effects/Adverse Effects | Antipsychotics Most Relevant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Note: individual drug actions cannot be predicted by receptor affinities alone, due to complexity of mechanism of action, drug metabolism and brain circuitry. Several adverse effects of APs are not clearly explained by receptor affinities (e.g., metabolic effects, CVD, mortality in dementia, seizures). |
| Dopamine (D 2 ) | Antagonism of D 2 receptors is the basic mechanism of action of all APs, since increased D 2 activity in the mesolimbic tract of the brain may be related to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Excessive dopamine blockade in other dopaminergic tracts of the brain may be associated with EPS, TD and hyperprolactinemia. | All APs have D 2 antagonist activity (with the exception of third-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine). FGAs have a higher affinity for D 2 receptors than SGAs and result in more dopamine-related ADRs. High-potency FGAs have a higher risk of dopamine-related ADRs. SGAs paliperidone and risperidone can also cause hyperprolactinemia. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine are a partial dopamine agonists, but are less potent than endogenous dopamine and result in an overall antagonistic effect. |
| Histaminic (H 1 ) | Sedation, appetite stimulation, weight gain. | More potential: low-potency FGAs, clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine. Less potential: aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, ziprasidone. |
| Muscarinic (M 1 ) | Anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation). | Low-potency phenothiazines, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine. Avoid in those with significant cognitive impairment, dementia or delirium and in the elderly. |
| Noradrenergic (alpha-1) | Orthostatic hypotension. | More potential: low-potency FGAs, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone. Less potential: aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, lurasidone, paliperidone. |
| Serotonin (5-HT 2A ) | Antagonism of 5-HT 2A receptors may increase dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical pathway (improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia) and the nigrostriatal pathway (decreasing risk of EPS). | SGAs have significant 5-HT 2A antagonist activity. SGAs have a higher 5-HT 2A /D 2 ratio, which maximizes antipsychotic action while minimizing risk of EPS. |

### Treatment Considerations

Tailor treatment to the specific phase of the disorder and to the patient’s signs and symptoms.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)

### Acute Phase (First Episode/Recurrent Acute Episode)

The [Figure 1](#c0122n00035) algorithm illustrates the management of patients in the acute phase of a psychotic episode.

- Haloperidol IM has been the most widely used treatment for psychotic agitation. The combination of haloperidol and promethazine is safe and effective in the management of psychosis-induced aggression.​[[42]](#HufGAlexanderJGandhiPEtAl.Haloperid-B1BF53AE)​[[43]](#OstinelliEGBrooke-PowneyMJLiXEtAl.H-0CE6E660) Although haloperidol combined with lorazepam has been shown to be more effective than haloperidol alone,​[[44]](#c0122n00186) this finding was not consistent across multiple studies.​[[43]](#OstinelliEGBrooke-PowneyMJLiXEtAl.H-0CE6E660)
- While only studied in mildly to moderately agitated patients, olanzapine IM appears to have efficacy similar to haloperidol and causes less EPS.​[[45]](#c0122n00185)​[[46]](#c0122n00184) Do not use the parenteral formulations of benzodiazepines and olanzapine in combination as there have been reports of cardiac and respiratory problems, including death, due to excessive depressive effects.
- Rapid-dissolving oral formulations of olanzapine are as effective as haloperidol IM​[[47]](#c0122n00183) if the patient is able and willing to take oral medications.
- Zuclopenthixol **acetate** is an injectable FGA with a pharmacokinetic profile (peak serum level in 24–48 hours, declining to one-third of peak concentration in 72 hours) that may reduce the number of injections required in severe acute agitation and/or aggression. It should not be used in antipsychotic-naïve patients.
- Patients with first-episode psychosis are more responsive to lower doses of antipsychotics,​[[48]](#c0122n00182)​[[49]](#c0122n00181) have a greater rate of recovery​[[48]](#c0122n00182) and are more prone to side effects.

  - When initiating SGAs (with the exception of ziprasidone and extended-release quetiapine), begin with a low dose and titrate gradually over 1–2 weeks up to the usual therapeutic range (see [Table 7](#c0122n00037)).
  - If a FGA is used, consider an intermediate-potency agent, such as loxapine or perphenazine, to minimize risk of adverse effects.
  - Benzodiazepines can be used to treat anxiety and agitation while titrating the dose of antipsychotic.
- With the exception of ziprasidone and extended-release quetiapine (both are quickly titrated to avoid adverse reactions), rapid titration and high doses of antipsychotics do not accelerate or enhance response and are rarely indicated. Even in patients with a chronic course, 4 mg of haloperidol is as effective as 10–40 mg and associated with fewer side effects and greater tolerability;​[[50]](#c0122n00020) in the author’s experience, a range of 2–5 mg of haloperidol is usually sufficient. Only a very small subgroup of patients appears to benefit from high-dose therapy.​[[51]](#c0122n00021)​[[52]](#SakuraiHSuzukiTBiesRREtAl.Increasin-B1C0ED9D) Doses exceeding the recommended daily maximum are sometimes required but should be used under the care of a psychiatrist.
- Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), such as aripiprazole, paliperidone **palmitate** or risperidone, should be offered as an option in all phases of illness, including the first episode, after first establishing tolerability with oral formulations.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7) See [Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics](#topic-112445-0D177C62) for more information.
- In the first episode, antipsychotic medication should be continued for at least 2 weeks unless there are significant tolerability issues. Assessment of treatment adherence and substance use is necessary in order to determine if there is an actual lack of response. An adequate trial of antipsychotic therapy is 4–6 weeks at a dose within the usual therapeutic range.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)​[[34]](#c0122n00193)​[[53]](#c0122n00187) If there is a partial response at 4 weeks, reassess at 8 weeks in order to determine if a switch to a different antipsychotic medication is indicated. Patients who fail to demonstrate even minimal response by that time are unlikely to benefit from a longer trial; consider switching to a different antipsychotic and consulting a psychiatrist.

### Stabilization/Stable Phases

- During the stabilization (recovery) phase, patients are vulnerable to relapse. Avoid changes in antipsychotic medication unless there are intolerable side effects or persistent residual symptoms that are distressing and/or disabling to the patient.
- Maintenance therapy is essential to prevent relapse. First-episode psychosis is associated with a 70–90% risk of relapse within 5 years. A significant percentage of patients relapse as early as the second year following discontinuation of antipsychotic therapy for first-episode psychosis.​[[54]](#c0122n00346)

  - Continue maintenance pharmacotherapy for at least 1–2 years for first-episode patients who achieve symptom remission and functional recovery.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)​[[53]](#c0122n00187)​[[55]](#Mayoral-vanSonJDeLaFozVOMartinez-Ga-B1C30025) Longer treatment (2–5 years) may be required for individuals with a long duration of untreated psychosis, more severe illness, slower response, substance abuse, and history of suicidal or aggressive behaviour.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)​[[53]](#c0122n00187) For patients with a history of 2 or more episodes, continue maintenance pharmacotherapy until the patient has been stable and relapse-free for at least 5 years.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)
  - Many patients will require antipsychotic treatment indefinitely.
  - In general, the lowest effective antipsychotic dose used during the acute phase should also be used in maintenance treatment.​[[21]](#c0122n00199)​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7) Reducing the antipsychotic dose in the treatment of multi-episode schizophrenia is not recommended, as this is associated with increased rates of relapse.​[[56]](#HojlundMKempADHaddadPMEtAl.Standard-858A7405) There is little evidence to support the use of more than 1 antipsychotic in acute or maintenance treatment for the majority of patients.​[[57]](#BorlidoCRemingtonGGraff-GuerreroAEt-CA74E37E)
- Poor medication adherence is common in patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Adherence rates of <70–80% are associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse and hospitalization.​[[58]](#c0122n00271)​[[59]](#c0122n00272) Patients who discontinue medications are 5 times more likely to relapse.​[[22]](#c0122n00198) Recovery from recurrent acute psychotic episodes (relapses) may take longer with each subsequent episode, and the degree of recovery may not be as great, resulting in persistent residual symptoms and functional disability.​[[22]](#c0122n00198)
- When discontinuing medication, gradually reduce the dose by ≤20% every 2–4 weeks. Reduce over a period of 6–12 months for first-episode patients and 6–24 months if patients have experienced 2 or more episodes.​[[21]](#c0122n00199) Monitor closely; if patients experience early signs of relapse, restabilize them on the previously effective dose of antipsychotic as quickly as possible.

### Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics

- Long-acting injectable antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, paliperidone **palmitate** or risperidone, should be offered as an option in all phases of illness, including the first episode, after first establishing tolerability with oral formulations.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)
- In addition to promoting adherence, LAIs may improve rates of remission and decrease the risk of hospitalization and relapse.​[[60]](#c0122n00429)​[[61]](#c0122n00392) A recent RCT in first-episode schizophrenia found better symptom control and a 6-fold reduction in relapse at 1 year with LAIs compared to oral formulations.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)
- LAI usage rates in Canada are low (6.3%) compared with the rest of the world (15–80%).​[[61]](#c0122n00392) Canadian qualitative studies of physician and patient attitudes toward LAIs indicate that physicians’ lack of knowledge and training in the use of LAIs, negative biases toward LAIs (treatment of last resort) and unfounded beliefs regarding patients’ rejection of LAIs due to fear of needles may contribute to the low rates of use.​[[62]](#c0122n00393)​[[63]](#c0122n00394)

### Antipsychotic Polypharmacy

- Combination therapy with more than 1 antipsychotic medication (antipsychotic polypharmacy) is not supported by available scientific evidence except for:​[[20]](#PringsheimTKellyMUrnessDEtAl.Physic-0CDE6DE3)
  - cross-titration when switching to a different antipsychotic
  - adjunctive treatment for partial responders to clozapine
- There is no good evidence to guide switching from one antipsychotic medication to another. Crossover medication strategies, over 2 weeks to 3 months,​[[64]](#c0122n00151) are preferred. [SwitchRx](https://switchrx.com/) is a Canadian online medication switching tool that provides clinicians with guidance on how to transition patients from one antipsychotic to another. It is important to complete the crossover to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy.
- Antipsychotic polypharmacy can lead to increased risk of drug-drug interactions that can be life-threatening, decreased efficacy, increased side effects and decreased adherence to treatment. It is therefore recommended that antipsychotic polypharmacy be used only in exceptional circumstances under the care of a psychiatrist.​[[65]](#Ortiz-OrendainJCastiello-deObesoSCo-7F531DC6)

### Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is commonly defined as a failure to respond (<20% reduction in positive symptoms) to 2 or more adequate trials (≥6 weeks) of non-clozapine antipsychotic medication.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)​[[66]](#HowesODMcCutcheonRAgidOEtAl.Treatme-EB2F423A) Clozapine is the only antipsychotic with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia​[[21]](#c0122n00199) in reducing hostility and aggression,​[[67]](#c0122n00190)​[[68]](#c0122n00189) persistent suicidality, and all-cause mortality.​[[69]](#WimberleyTMacCabeJHLaursenTMEtAl.Mo-0CE1EBFE) Patients successfully stabilized on clozapine have not been shown to benefit further from switching to any other antipsychotic medication or from the addition of a second antipsychotic.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)

Clozapine is reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia due to the risk of agranulocytosis and the need for regular blood monitoring. A discussion on the assessment and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia is beyond the scope of this chapter, but may be found in the Canadian schizophrenia guidelines (see [Suggested Readings](#c0122n00249)).

### Treatment of Comorbid Conditions

### Depression and Suicidality

- Psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with schizophrenia with an estimated prevalence of 50% for depression, 29% for post-traumatic stress disorder, 23% for obsessive-compulsive disorder and 15% for panic disorder.​[[70]](#BuckleyPFMillerBJLehrerDSEtAl.Psych-B1CABF45) The lifetime risk of suicide is approximately 5%.​[[71]](#HorKTaylorM.SuicideAndSchizophrenia-B1CAD901)
- Depressive symptoms are common in the prodromal phase preceding the onset of a first episode of psychosis. In the acute phase, particularly in multiple-episode patients, depressive symptoms usually remit along with the positive psychotic symptoms.

  - SGAs may be more effective than FGAs in treating depressive symptoms​[[72]](#c0122n00152) in the acute phase. In those with persistent suicidality, consideration should be given to clozapine.​[[24]](#APAPracticeGuidelines) There is minimal evidence to support the use of an antidepressant in the acute phase.​[[30]](#RemingtonGAddingtonDHonerWEtAl.Guid-0CE12BE7)
- Major depressive episodes occur as often in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia as in those with either schizoaffective disorder or nonpsychotic major depression.​[[73]](#c0122n00153)

  - Patients with first-episode psychosis have a greater risk of depression compared with multiple-episode patients, particularly in the stabilization phase (postpsychotic depression);​[[73]](#c0122n00153) depressive symptoms tend to increase for the first 3 months following a first episode of psychosis.
- It can be difficult to differentiate between depression and ongoing negative symptoms or antipsychotic-induced emotional blunting. Rating scales, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory, have not been validated in individuals with schizophrenia. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)​[[74]](#c0122n00156) can be used to differentiate between negative symptoms and symptoms of major depression. A CDSS score ≥6 is considered clinically significant.​[[75]](#AddingtonDAddingtonJMaticka-Tyndale-B1CBC5CC)
- Antidepressant medication may be useful in the treatment of major depression in the stabilization or stable phases.​[[76]](#KruizingaJLiemburgEBurgerHEtAl.Phar-858DD3AC) As stated in [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0122n00004), CBT may be effective in treating residual psychotic symptoms as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety.​[[26]](#PsychosisAndSchizophreniaInAdultsTr-CA78DE77)

### Substance Abuse

- Higher rates of substance abuse/dependence disorders are found in individuals with schizophrenia (lifetime prevalence of 47–50%) compared with the general population. Persistent substance abuse is associated with poor treatment adherence, greater risk of suicidality and aggression, and significantly poorer outcomes.
- Cannabis use is a risk factor for psychosis and there appears to be a dose-response relationship between amount of use and risk of psychosis;​[[77]](#MarconiADiFortiMLewisCMEtAl.Meta-an-B1CE2F8B)​[[78]](#MooreTHZammitSLingford-HughesAEtAl.-B1CE549D) higher-potency cannabis products may also confer increased risk.​[[79]](#DiFortiMQuattroneDFreemanTPEtAl.The-803049F4) The prevalence of cannabis use in individuals with psychotic disorders is higher than in the general population, particularly in early psychosis where rates of use are as high as 86% and rates of cannabis abuse/dependence range from 14–28%.​[[80]](#EdwardsJElkinsKHintonMEtAl.Randomiz-B2C62F64) Cannabis use is associated with poor antipsychotic adherence, greater severity and chronicity of symptoms, and 4 times the risk of relapse.​[[81]](#LinszenDHDingemansPMNugterMAEtAl.Pa-B2C63164)
- The rate of smoking in individuals with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders is extremely high (70% in Canada),​[[82]](#c0122n00273) compared with a rate of approximately 20% in the general population ([www.smoke-free.ca](http://www.smoke-free.ca)). Patients with psychotic disorders are more likely to be heavy smokers and are 2–3 times more likely than nonsmokers to abuse other substances.​[[83]](#c0122n00274)

  - It is estimated that patients with schizophrenia have a life expectancy that is 20% lower than the general population. This is mostly attributable to increased rates of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, for which smoking is a significant risk factor.​[[84]](#c0122n00275)
  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke can induce the metabolism of some antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine and olanzapine); smokers require higher doses of these antipsychotics, leading to increased adverse effects.​[[85]](#c0122n00277) Dose adjustments may be required during hospitalization, when patients stop and restart smoking. These interactions are not related to nicotine; no further adjustments are required if nicotine replacement therapy is used.
  - Actively encourage smoking cessation, even though success rates are low in patients with psychotic disorders (in patients with psychoses, only 9% are former smokers compared with 14–49% in the general population).​[[82]](#c0122n00273) Nicotine replacement therapies may be helpful. Bupropion and varenicline are also effective in smoking cessation; the risks of new or worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms have been shown to be lower than previously reported.​[[86]](#AnthenelliRMBenowitzNLWestREtAl.Neu-B1D13DF0) However, monitoring for changes in mood and behaviour should still occur, especially in those with a history of suicidal ideation/attempts, depressed mood or agitation/hostility. For more information, see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation.
- In patients (and particularly in those with first-episode psychosis) who appear to have been using substances as a form of self-medication, substance abuse may remit spontaneously with recovery from the acute episode.
- A harm-reduction approach that incorporates motivational interviewing is recommended for individuals with comorbid substance abuse problems. Refer patients with persistent substance abuse to a mental-health program that can provide a comprehensive, integrated approach.​[[87]](#c0122n00157)

### Side Effects of Antipsychotics

[Table 4](#29A3DF80) compares the side effect profile of second-generation antipsychotics. [Table 5](#29A3E442) provides guidance on the assessment and management of antipsychotic-induced side effects.

- Closely monitor and manage side effects, since they are the leading cause of nonadherence to medication.
- Patients taking antipsychotics long term ranked the most burdensome and function-impairing side effects as follows: sedation/tiredness, weight gain, difficulty thinking/concentrating (often due to sedation) and restlessness (an EPS).​[[88]](#c0122n00361)

**Table 5:** Antipsychotic-Induced Side Effects: Assessment, Monitoring and Management​[[20]](#PringsheimTKellyMUrnessDEtAl.Physic-0CDE6DE3)[[89]](#c0122n00180)[[90]](#c0122n00352)

| Side Effects | Incidence, Assessment and Monitoring | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiovascular | Incidence: orthostatic hypotension is the most common AP-induced CVD effect, usually with low-potency FGAs and clozapine, but can occur with other SGAs. QT c prolongation may occur with chlorpromazine, pimozide and haloperidol. Among SGAs, ziprasidone has a greater (though modest) capacity for QT c prolongation. APs confer a dose-related increase in the risk of sudden cardiac death​ [91] and an increased risk of MI.​ [92] Clozapine is associated with an increased risk of myocarditis (especially in, but not limited to, the first month of therapy) and other CVD complications. Assessment: baseline vital signs; family history and medical history. In individuals at risk of electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia (e.g., history of kidney disease, diuretic therapy, water intoxication, eating disorders, prolonged vomiting/diarrhea, alcoholism), measure baseline electrolytes and correct abnormalities. The 2021 APA guidelines recommend baseline ECG in patients with cardiovascular risk factors for QT c prolongation and those starting chlorpromazine, pimozide or ziprasidone.​ [24] Monitoring: vital signs at 12 wk then annually; monitor more frequently as indicated and when initiating clozapine until dose is stable; annual cardiovascular risk assessment. ECG as clinically indicated, with significant dose changes (chlorpromazine, pimozide or ziprasidone), with addition of other medications that can affect QT c in patients with cardiovascular risk factors for QT c prolongation or elevated baseline levels.​ [24] For clozapine: troponin, CRP and ECG in presence of signs and symptoms of possible myocarditis. | Educate about risks and prevention of orthostatic hypotension. If symptoms persist, decrease dose of AP, if possible, or switch to another AP. Clozapine-induced myocarditis: discontinue clozapine immediately and consult cardiology. Despite these and other contributory CVD risk factors (e.g., metabolic), APs reduce overall mortality risk.​ [93] |
| Dermatologic | Incidence: DRESS (rare) associated with several SGAs.​ [94] Mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported.​ [95] Assessment: rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes and swollen face; can result in injury to liver, kidneys, lungs, heart and pancreas. | Early recognition, stop AP, supportive care (see Drug-Induced Skin Reactions ). |
| Dyslipidemias | Incidence: hyperlipidemia has been associated with clozapine and olanzapine. Increased triglycerides have been reported with quetiapine. Assessment: baseline fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides). Monitoring: fasting lipid profile at 12 wk after initiation of a new AP, then annually; more frequent monitoring if significant weight gain, and every 6 months if LDL and/or triglycerides above the normal range. | Educate on change in diet. Consult the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia. Consider switching to ziprasidone​ [96] ​ [97] or another agent with lower risk (see Table 4 ). |
| Endocrine, sexual and urinary effects | Incidence: hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of high-potency FGAs, risperidone and paliperidone. Sexual dysfunction is associated with all APs and is not necessarily related to elevated prolactin levels alone. Urinary retention risk is greatest with drugs that have significant anticholinergic activity.​ [98] Assessment: baseline functional inquiry including menstrual history and libido in women, and libido, erectile and ejaculatory function in men; baseline prolactin level in first-episode psychosis, before initiating an AP associated with hyperprolactinemia and when indicated. Monitoring: monthly for 3 months after initiating a new AP, then yearly. | Determine underlying cause of endocrine or sexual dysfunction and treat accordingly. Consider drugs for erectile dysfunction. For clinically significant hyperprolactinemia, reduce dose of AP; if dose reduction not tolerated (emergence of or increase in psychotic symptoms), consider switching to an AP not associated with hyperprolactinemia (see Table 4 ). |
| Extrapyramidal side effects (akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, tardive akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia) | Incidence: SGAs have a significantly reduced risk of EPS and tardive dyskinesia compared with FGAs.​ [21] ​ [33] ​ [34] ​ [99] ​ [100] The incidence of TD is 5.5% per year with FGAs and 3.9% with SGAs.​ [20] Assessment: ESRS is the recommended tool to assess EPS including tardive dyskinesia. Other tools include AIMS, BARS and SAS. Parkinsonism can be associated with dysphoria, decreased concentration and slowing of cognition. Akathisia (subjective and objective restlessness) is often misidentified as psychotic agitation, which can result in an increase in dose of the offending AP. Tardive dyskinesia consists of repetitive, involuntary choreoathetoid movements usually involving the buccal-oral-lingual musculature, face, trunk, extremities or respiratory muscles, and can be permanent and disabling. Monitoring: baseline assessment in AP-naïve first-episode patients, in multiple-episode patients when initiating a new AP, and in first-episode and multiple-episode patients whenever dosage of AP is changed. Monitor weekly for 2–4 wk or until EPS resolves; in stable patients, monitor for TD at every clinical encounter or every 6 months or more often in patients at higher risk (on FGAs, erratic medication adherence or intermittent treatment, female, age >55, diagnosis of an affective disorder, substance abuse, diabetes). | Prevention is key—use SGAs first line. If EPS occurs, reduce dose; consider switch to SGA if on FGA.​ [24] If EPS persists, consider anticholinergics (benztropine, procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl). Prophylactic use of anticholinergics is not recommended. Akathisia: if dose reduction is not effective, beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol 10–120 mg/day ) are treatment of choice with monitoring for hypotension. Benzodiazepines also provide symptom relief. Anticholinergics are ineffective. Acute dystonia (acute torticollis, oculogyric crisis): benztropine or diphenhydramine IM followed by reduction in dose or switch to SGA. Tardive dyskinesia: no evidence-based treatment; therefore, prevention is key.​ [101] Use SGAs first line. Antiparkinsonian medications not effective and may worsen symptoms. If TD occurs, suggest consultation with a psychiatrist. Consider switching to an SGA. For persistent, severe TD, consider clozapine trial. There is limited evidence for use of tetrabenazine but it may considered if TD persists.​ [24] |
| Glucose abnormalities | Incidence: both FGAs and SGAs are associated with greater risk of glucose abnormalities including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, new onset type 2 diabetes, exacerbation of type 1 diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis.​ [102] Among SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine have the highest risk. Assessment: baseline fasting plasma glucose; HbA 1c if difficult to obtain fasting plasma glucose; OGTT if evidence of impaired glucose tolerance; family history and medical history. Monitoring: signs and symptoms of emergent diabetes; fasting plasma glucose 12 wk after initiating new AP, then yearly; more frequent monitoring required if significant weight gain or if symptomatic; OGTT if evidence of impaired glucose tolerance. | Educate about signs and symptoms of emergent diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed, follow the Diabetes Canada guidelines for diabetes and mental health . Consider switching to another AP with lower risk (see Table 4 ). |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | Incidence: rare, but can occur with any AP at any dose and at any time. Assessment: physical exam with focus on level of consciousness; vital signs (fever, tachycardia, fluctuations in BP); look for evidence of severe muscle rigidity (not to be confused with cogwheel-type rigidity due to drug-induced parkinsonism) and elevated levels of creatine kinase and white blood cells. Risk factors include young age, male, neurologic disabilities, dehydration, agitation, exhaustion, and rapid or parenteral administration of AP. | Medical emergency: discontinue AP and provide supportive care (hydration and cooling). Dantrolene 2–3 mg/kg TID–QID IV (maximum 10 mg/kg daily) or bromocriptine 2.5–5 mg TID PO, increasing by 2.5 mg TID Q24H (maximum 60 mg daily).​ [64] |
| Sedation and cognitive effects | Incidence: sedation is very common and can be disabling, especially when first starting AP or increasing dose. Low-potency FGAs and some SGAs are implicated. Cognitive effects are less common with SGAs, but can occur especially with SGAs with greater anticholinergic activity (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine). Assessment: daytime drowsiness, excessive sleep, cognitive “dulling”; obtain collateral information from caregivers and family; anticholinergics (for EPS) and antiepileptics (for mood stabilization) can worsen cognitive effects.​ [105] ​ [106] Monitoring: weekly for first 4–6 wk after initiating new AP. | Use SGAs as first-line treatment to reduce risk of cognitive side effects.​ [103] ​ [104] Use a low initial dose and gradual titration based on degree of sedation, especially with clozapine and first-episode psychosis (exceptions include quetiapine XR and ziprasidone, for which rapid titration is recommended). Give entire daily dose at HS if possible to reduce daytime drowsiness. Do not use anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents prophylactically; avoid prolonged use when treating acute EPS. |
| Weight gain | Incidence: for FGAs, the risk of weight gain is greatest with low-potency agents. For many SGAs, there is a higher risk of weight gain compared with FGAs (see Table 3 ); may be rapid and usually plateaus within 1 y. Assessment: baseline weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference. Monitoring: weight and BMI monthly for 6 months with new AP then every 3 months when on a stable dosage; waist circumference annually. | Prevention is critical, as weight reduction is especially difficult in individuals with mental illness. Educate about risk of weight gain and provide dietary and exercise counselling. If weight increases >7% over baseline, implement behavioural weight reduction program. If unsuccessful, assess risks/benefits of continuing current AP vs. switching to an AP with lower risk (see Table 4 ). In CATIE, ziprasidone was the only agent to show improvement in weight and metabolic parameters following a switch from another SGA.​ [96] Dose reduction unlikely to result in weight loss. Addition of metformin can also be considered.​ [20] |

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Prenatal and Perinatal Risk Factors for Schizophrenia

A number of prenatal and perinatal factors have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring to varying degrees. These include malnutrition, viral illnesses such as influenza, obesity, x-ray radiation, exposure to cat feces infected with *Toxoplasmosis gondii* protozoa, use of analgesics (e.g., ASA), season of birth (lack of sunlight exposure/vitamin D deficiency), maternal-fetal Rh incompatibility, low birth weight and obstetric complications (hypoxia).

### Psychosis and Pregnancy

The onset of a first episode of psychosis during pregnancy is uncommon but if it occurs, it is considered a psychiatric emergency and requires treatment because of the potential adverse effects of psychosis on both mother and fetus. Patients who experience a psychotic episode during pregnancy have twice the rate of adverse outcomes including stillbirth, infant death, prematurity and small size for gestational age, even when controlling for other variables including age, education, smoking, marital status, parity and pregnancy-induced hypertension.​[[107]](#c0122n00333)

Although patients with schizophrenia may have lower fertility rates compared with the general population, their relative fertility has increased since deinstitutionalization, possibly due to a change in drug selection. High-potency antipsychotics are prescribed less often or at lower doses, resulting in less effect on prolactin levels and ovulation inhibition. More recent studies have found similar numbers of pregnancies in patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population.​[[108]](#c0122n00334)​[[109]](#c0122n00335) Patients with schizophrenia also have higher rates of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies; less social support; poorer antenatal care; poorer nutrition; greater use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substances; and the majority experience intermittent loss of custody.​[[110]](#c0122n00336)

Patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders should receive counselling about contraception and pregnancy early in the course of their illness. If a pregnancy is planned, a consultation with a psychiatrist is recommended to evaluate the risks/benefits of maintenance antipsychotics during pregnancy. Pregnancy in a woman being treated for schizophrenia is considered high-risk; referrals to a mental-health clinic and obstetrician are recommended and, if possible, the pregnancy should be managed through a high-risk clinic.

### Psychosis and the Postpartum Period

The rate of postpartum psychosis is 1–2/1000 births; it usually occurs within 2–4 weeks after delivery. This is a psychiatric emergency because of the rare but serious risk of suicide and/or infanticide. If hospitalization is required and the patient’s condition does not pose a risk to the newborn, the patient and baby should be kept together, ideally in a specialized unit.

In the postpartum period, the risk of relapse of schizophrenia and related psychosis is high (~24%) and is greatest during the first 3 months. Patients with schizoaffective disorder are particularly at risk.​[[111]](#c0122n00337) If an individual has a history of postpartum psychosis, the overall risk of relapse in a subsequent pregnancy is approximately 35%.​[[112]](#WesselooRKampermanAMMunk-OlsenTEtAl-B23C4875)

### Antipsychotics and Pregnancy

There have been no randomized controlled trials of FGAs or SGAs in pregnant patients. Teratogenic effects, including major congenital malformations, have not been demonstrated with the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy.​[[113]](#WangZBrauerRManKKCEtAl.PrenatalExpo-85C456D5) A large cohort study demonstrated increased risk of withdrawal symptoms, neurological disorders and persistent pulmonary hypertension among infants exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy; absolute incidence remained low (<2%).​[[114]](#HeinonenEForsbegLNorbyUEtAl.Neonata-EB34B523) In terms of long-term effects, another large cohort study did not find increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD, autism) with antipsychotic use during pregnancy.​[[115]](#WangZChanAYLCoghillDEtAl.Associatio-85C5E95B) A meta-analysis found that patients who continued antipsychotics during pregnancy had an increased risk of gestational diabetes; olanzapine and quetiapine may be particularly problematic due to their metabolic adverse effects.​[[116]](#KocukgoncuSGuloksuzSCelikKEtAl.Anti-85CCE420)

While minimizing exposure to all medications is generally advisable in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, the risks/benefits of antipsychotic use and the choice of medication must be carefully weighed for each patient, considering factors such as severity of past psychotic episodes, vulnerability to relapse, remission versus ongoing residual symptoms, current substance use, level of functioning, availability of social supports and history of prior response including side effects (EPS, weight gain, diabetes).

For many pregnant patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, maintenance antipsychotics at the lowest dose possible to prevent relapse will be recommended, as maintenance therapy may ultimately reduce risks to the fetus associated with an acute psychotic relapse, such as exposure to higher maternal doses of medication.​[[110]](#c0122n00336)​[[117]](#TosatoSALbertUTomassiSEtAl.ASystema-0D1D2DA5)

### Antipsychotics and the Postpartum Period

Because of the high risk of relapse in the postpartum period, restart antipsychotics immediately after the delivery if they were discontinued during pregnancy. Closely monitor patients maintained on low-dose maintenance antipsychotics during pregnancy for early signs of relapse, as an increased dose may be needed in the postpartum period. In infants exposed to clozapine in utero, a neutrophil count is recommended; in those exposed to high-potency antipsychotics in utero (third trimester), monitor for EPS for several days.​[[73]](#c0122n00153)

### Antipsychotics and Breastfeeding

Antipsychotics are generally passed into breast milk and are detectable at levels considered compatible with breastfeeding; however, data in this patient population is limited, and long-term studies are needed. ​[[118]](#c0122n00338) With use of FGAs, drowsiness and lethargy have been reported, although many studies cite no adverse events.​[[118]](#c0122n00338) Of the SGAs, olanzapine is the preferred agent in breastfeeding patients based on over 100 documented cases of low infant exposure.​[[119]](#UguzF.Second-generationAntipsychoti-8033E6EF) Quetiapine also demonstrated low infant exposure, although the number of documented cases was lower than olanzapine. Risperidone was associated with more infant exposure than other SGAs and may not be a preferred option. Breastfeeding while taking clozapine is not recommended.​[[73]](#c0122n00153)

There is no consensus regarding breastfeeding in patients being treated with antipsychotics; some experts recommend against breastfeeding until further data are available.​[[110]](#c0122n00336) The potential benefits of breastfeeding must be weighed against potential adverse effects and discussed with each individual patient. If antipsychotics are used, monitor the infant for adverse effects such as poor feeding, lethargy, drowsiness and delayed developmental milestones.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use During Pregnancy and Drug Use During Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Early detection of possible psychosis, including recognition of prodromal psychosis and referral to a specialized early psychosis program, is associated with better symptomatic and functional outcomes.
- Initiate treatment before the development of a crisis, such as self-harm, aggression or violence.​[[53]](#c0122n00187)
- Provide treatment in the least restrictive setting, considering safety issues, availability of community resources (including both caregiver and mental-health supports), the patient’s insight and competency to consent to treatment, and ability to cooperate with treatment.​[[53]](#c0122n00187)
- Integrate psychosocial interventions, such as patient and family psychoeducation, supportive therapy, motivational interviewing, and stress management, with the use of antipsychotic medications in order to promote adherence to treatment and optimize outcomes.​[[23]](#NormanRLecomteTAddingtonDEtAl.Canad-0CDF2EFE)​[[53]](#c0122n00187)
- Conduct baseline and regular ongoing assessments of signs and symptoms, possible comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance use), risk of suicide and aggression, level of functioning, response to treatment, medication side effects, and adherence during all phases of the disorder. A variety of standardized scales and semistructured interviews facilitate these assessments (see [Table 2](#c0122n00013)).​[[13]](#AddingtonDAbidiSGarcia-OrtegaEtAl.C-0CDB005D)
- To ensure continuity of care, longitudinal follow-up by the same clinician or multidisciplinary team is optimal.​[[53]](#c0122n00187)

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage[b] | Adverse Effects[c] | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antipsychotics, second-generation**

| aripiprazole Abilify , generics $150–350 | Initial: 10–15 mg/day PO. Best taken in the morning due to risk of activating side effects (i.e., insomnia) In first-episode psychosis: 2–5 mg then gradually titrate to 10–15 mg/day Titration: If necessary, increase dose after 2 wk (due to long half-life) Maximum: 30 mg/day | EPS (akathisia, parkinsonism), dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, headache, GI complaints, nasopharyngitis, tremor, sedation, insomnia. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. | Carbamazepine (or other strong inducers of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, such as phenytoin, rifampin) can decrease aripiprazole levels significantly. Ketoconazole, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine (or other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4) can increase levels substantially. | May also be classified as a third-generation antipsychotic. Partial agonist activity at D 2 and 5HT 1A receptors and potent antagonism activity at 5HT 2A receptors (potential efficacy in treating negative and depressive symptoms). |
| aripiprazole prolonged release injectable suspension Abilify Maintena $350–550 | Ensure patient tolerates aripiprazole oral doses before initiating IM dose Initial: 400 mg IM × 1 dose; continue aripiprazole 10–20 mg daily PO × 14 days Alternative initial dose: 2 x 400 mg IM injections (at separate sites) plus 1 x 20 mg PO Maintenance: 400 mg monthly IM | EPS (akathisia, parkinsonism), dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, headache, GI complaints, nasopharyngitis, tremor, sedation, insomnia. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Consider dose reduction to 300 mg monthly IM if adverse reactions with higher dose. | Carbamazepine (or other strong inducers of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, such as phenytoin, rifampin) can decrease aripiprazole levels significantly. Ketoconazole, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine (or other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4) can increase levels substantially. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers for more than 14 days may cause lower aripiprazole levels and reduce efficacy. Dose adjustments recommended when patients are adding or discontinuing concomitant strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. Increased sedation when combined with alcohol or other CNS drugs. | May also be classified as a third-generation antipsychotic. Partial agonist activity at D 2 and 5HT 1A receptors and potent antagonism activity at 5HT 2A receptors (potential efficacy in treating negative and depressive symptoms). |
| asenapine Saphris < $150 | Initial: 5 mg BID SL Titration: target therapeutic dose same as initial dose ( 5 mg BID SL) Maximum: 10 mg BID SL | Oral hypoesthesia and paresthesia (occur after administration and usually resolve in 1 h), orthostatic hypotension, sedation, insomnia, EPS, constipation. Minimal effect on weight, glucose, lipids. Hypersensitivity reactions, often after first dose, have occurred. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | May potentiate antihypertensive drug effects. Strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as fluvoxamine, increase asenapine levels. Other CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors may affect asenapine levels. | Derived from the antidepressant mirtazapine and is a potent multireceptor antagonist with strong affinity for a number of serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors.​ [120] Instruct patients to handle the tablet with dry hands, to place it under the tongue immediately, to allow it to dissolve completely (do not chew or swallow) and to not drink or eat for 10 min afterward. If asenapine is taken in combination with other oral medications, it should be taken last. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of a serious allergic reaction and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if one occurs. |
| brexpiprazole Rexulti < $150 | Initial: 1 mg daily Titration: Day 1–4: 1 mg daily Day 5–7: 2 mg daily Depending on clinical response and tolerability, on Day 8, increase to 4 mg Reduce dose to maximum of 3 mg in patients with moderate-severe hepatic and renal impairment | Headache, insomnia or sedation, nausea, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, EPS. Cases of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, weight gain and sleep apnea have been reported. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Ketoconazole, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine (and other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4) can increase levels substantially; modify dose as appropriate. Brexpiprazole levels can be reduced by strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin). Modify dose as appropriate. Not affected by smoking. | May also be classified as a third-generation antipsychotic. Partial agonist at the 5HT 1A , dopamine D 2 and D 3 receptors and as an antagonist at the 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 7 , noradrenergic alpha- 1A , alpha- 1B , alpha- 1D and alpha- 2C receptors.​ [40] This receptor profile leads to a favourable antipsychotic profile for the treatment of positive, negative, mood and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia with a low risk of akathisia and EPS, weight gain and metabolic complications.​ [121] |
| cariprazine Vraylar $150–350 | Initial: 1.5 mg daily Titration: increase gradually by 1.5 mg increments Usual: 1.5–6 mg once daily Maximum: 6 mg/day | EPS, akathisia, insomnia, restlessness, aggression, headache and hypertension. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Extensively metabolized by CYP3A4; contraindicated in combination with moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers and for at least 2 wk after discontinuation (inhibitors). | Due to a long half-life, adverse effects may appear several weeks after initiation and dose adjustments. May also be classified as a third-generation antipsychotic. Partial agonist of D 3 , D 2 , 5–HT 1A . Higher affinity for D 3 receptors may have potential to treat cognitive impairment and anhedonia. |
| clozapine Clozaril , generics $150–350 | Initial: 12.5–25 mg/day PO Titration: increase by 12.5–25 mg on second day and then by 25–50 mg daily PO depending on tolerance Usual: 300–600 mg/day PO Maximum: 900 mg/day Divided in 1–3 doses/day | Agranulocytosis (<1%), seizures (1–5%; dose-related), sedation, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, fever, nausea, weight gain, hypersalivation (30–50%), urinary incontinence, constipation; increased risk of diabetes and hyperlipidemia; myocarditis and other cardiac effects. Hypersalivation and sedation may contribute to pneumonia and subsequent toxicity. Constipation may evolve into potentially fatal intestinal obstruction. DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants; may potentiate antihypertensive drug effects; inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as diltiazem, fluvoxamine or propranolol, or of CYP3A4, such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice or prednisone, may increase clozapine levels; inducers of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin or cigarette smoking, may reduce clozapine levels; respiratory depression with higher doses of benzodiazepines; avoid use with bone marrow suppressants and drugs that lower the seizure threshold. | A few case reports describe elevated clozapine levels and toxicity after COVID-19 vaccination or natural infection, possibly due to inflammation-induced inhibition of CYP1A2.​ [122] Close monitoring after vaccination/infection is warranted. Associated with a greater risk of hematological malignancies (absolute risk low at 0.7%).​ [123] |
