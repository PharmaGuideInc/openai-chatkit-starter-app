### Introduction

Pruritus, the sensation of itch, can be classified as localized or generalized, and as acute or chronic. While most people typically experience pruritus as an acute, localized reaction to a trigger (e.g., a mosquito bite), chronic pruritus, defined as lasting for 6 weeks or longer, afflicts up to 17% of the general population​[[1]](#PereiraMPZeidlerCStorckMEtAl.Challe-41D467E9) and an estimated 25–50% of older individuals.​[[2]](#Valdes-RodriguezRMollanazarNKGonzxe-4259F5AB)​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D) Chronic pruritus has a substantial impact on quality of life, comparable to that of chronic pain.​[[4]](#KiniSPDeLongLKVeledarEEtAl.TheImpac-42595CBD)

There are a number of pruritic conditions specific to pregnancy that must be considered when evaluating a pregnant patient with pruritus. The assessment and management of these conditions is outside the scope of this chapter.

This chapter focusses on chronic pruritus, the etiology of which can be inflammatory, neuropathic, psychogenic, idiopathic or secondary to systemic disease or medication.​[[5]](#LipmanZZMIngrasciGYosipovitchG.Appr-425AC5CF)

### Goals of Therapy

- Determine cause of pruritus (see [Table 1](#n00255), [Investigations](#c0070n00011), [Table 2](#MedicationsAssociatedWithPruritus), [Figure 1](#c0070n00002))
- Rule out underlying systemic disease (found in about 20–30% of pruritic patients without skin disorders​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)) (see [Figure 1](#c0070n00002))
- Individualize management of pruritus to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk of side effects

### Investigations

- History should include assessing:

  - association of itching with visible skin rash
  - location, duration, severity, temporal features (constant or waxing/waning) and aggravating/relieving factors
  - skin care, including cleansing routine (e.g., harsh soaps, products with fragrance, bubble bath preparations), topical agents applied to the skin and use of hot tubs
  - possible environmental exposures at home or work that may be contributory
  - prescription, nonprescription and illicit drug use (see [Table 2](#MedicationsAssociatedWithPruritus))
  - renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, lymphoreticular or endocrine disease
  - unintended weight loss, fever/chills, night sweats
  - history of travel to, or immigration from, regions where tropical parasitic diseases are common​[[6]](#JuTVanderDoesAIngrasciGEtAl.Tropica-48F64DCC)
  - psychosocial stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia (both as possible etiologic factors or as consequences of chronic pruritus)
- Physical examination should focus on presence of skin rash, dryness, burrows, excoriations, dermatographism (urtication on stroking the skin), urtication with pressure or cold exposure, abnormal skin pigmentation (sallowness, jaundice, purple-red discoloration), lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
- Laboratory investigations are indicated only if a primary dermatologic cause for pruritus has been excluded and include CBC with differential, fasting serum glucose, liver function tests (including bilirubin), renal function tests, chest x-ray and HIV testing. Further testing including TSH, calcium, protein electrophoresis and stool for ova and parasites can be considered if the initial work-up is negative and the cause of pruritus remains unclear.
- Depending on the index of suspicion, further investigations may be required to identify underlying systemic disease (see [Figure 1](#c0070n00002)).
- Medications may play a role in the development of pruritus through a number of mechanisms: hypersensitivity reaction (itch may occur without skin rash), secondary to drug-induced skin lesions, cholestatic liver disease, release of histamine, activation of mu-opioid receptors, activation of peripheral serotonin receptors, xerosis, deposits of drugs or metabolites in the skin, phototoxicity, neurological alterations. Medications that are known to be associated with pruritus are listed in [Table 2](#MedicationsAssociatedWithPruritus). Case reports exist for numerous other drugs and a trial of stopping any suspected drug (for at least 6 wk) is worthwhile, if feasible.
- Keep in mind that xerosis is the most common cause of chronic pruritus in older patients, although underlying dermatoses, generalized pruritus of unknown origin (GPUO), malignancy, neurogenic itch and medications may also play a role.​[[2]](#Valdes-RodriguezRMollanazarNKGonzxe-4259F5AB)​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)

**Table 1:** Physical Appearance and Management of Common Pruritic Skin Diseases

[a] It is important to keep in mind that excoriation or lichenification may be misdiagnosed as a primary inflammatory skin condition instead of as a result of scratching due to chronic pruritus of another etiology.

**Table 2:** Medications Associated with Pruritus​​[[a]](#afn40114)

| Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotension II Inhibitors Amiodarone Antimalarials (chloroquine, others)​ [b] Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) Heparin Hydrochlorothiazide Hydroxyethyl starch (HES)​ [c] | Interleukin-2 Macrolides Opioids​ [d] Penicillins Statins Stimulants (cocaine, MDMA, ADHD medications)​ [e] Targeted cancer therapies (monoclonal antibodies and derivatives, small molecule inhibitors, see Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy ) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole |

[a] Drug-induced pruritus may occur in the absence of rash. This list is not exhaustive. Case reports exist for numerous other drugs and a trial of stopping any suspected drug (for at least 6 wk) is worthwhile, if feasible.

[b] Chloroquine-induced pruritus during malaria treatment occurs in 60–70% of patients of African descent and is often severe. Prednisolone, niacin and dapsone have been used as treatment.​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)

[c] HES is a synthetic volume expander used in fluid management including during surgery. HES commonly induces pruritus, which can be severe. Development of itch may take several weeks after exposure to HES and last many months.​[[14]](#Stxe4nderSRichterLOsadaNEtAl.Hydrox-498B7424)

[d] Opioid-induced pruritus is common. Various medications have been used to alleviate opioid-induced pruritus when stopping the opioid is not feasible.​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)

[e] Usually described as a crawling sensation under the skin rather than an itch.

### Therapeutic Choices

Information on therapeutic choices can also be found in [Figure 1](#c0070n00002) and [Table 4](#c0070n00021).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Institute the following nonpharmacologic measures in all patients, regardless of etiology of itch:

- **Hydrate skin.** Dry skin due to low ambient humidity or harsh soaps frequently exacerbates pruritus. Dry skin is particularly common in older individuals due to impaired barrier function. Xerosis can be improved with use of gentle cleansers and moisturizers. As most soaps are alkaline and can strip natural moisturizers from the skin, the use of synthetic detergents (such as Cerave, Cetaphil or Spectrogel cleanser, which have a neutral or slightly acidic pH) or moisturizing gentle soaps with neutral pH can be useful. Helpful measures include avoiding hot water, hot tubs and dry saunas and ensuring adequate indoor humidity (including the use of humidifiers). Bathing is therapeutic for dry skin if water can be entrapped within the skin. A daily tepid bath or shower for 5–10 minutes hydrates the skin. Hydration can be retained by immediate application of moisturizers (see [Moisturizers](#Moisturizers)).
- **Minimize friction and irritation to the skin.** Gentle towel drying and applying moisturizers and topical medications by dabbing rather than rubbing can help minimize further irritation. Clothing should be soft and loose, and preferably made from cotton. Avoid woolen and synthetic fabrics as well as rough, exposed seams or interfacing. Rinse out detergents thoroughly during laundering, and avoid antistatic agents in the dryer. Use fragrance-free products for laundry, skin cleansing and personal care.
- **Minimize scratching.** Pruritus produces a powerful stimulus to scratch. This scratch-itch cycle is self-perpetuating. Cool compresses can be applied for 20 minutes 4–6 times daily for acute localized itch. A covering of light clothing over the itchy area decreases nonintentional scratching. Fingernails and toenails should be kept short.
- **Avoid aggravating factors.** Examples include excessive exercise, high environmental temperature and humidity, hot or prolonged showers or baths, spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Patients should maintain a flare diary to identify triggering factors.
- **Ensure adequate sleep.** Pruritus is frequently worse at night, though the reason for this is not completely understood.​[[15]](#c0070n00160) Moisturizer/emollient or antipruritic topical lotion applied just before bedtime, use of light bedclothes, cool ambient temperature, sleeping without blankets, and use of a sedating antihistamine may be helpful.​[[15]](#c0070n00160) See [Pharmacologic Choices](#c0070n00015).
- **Psychological therapies** such as habit reversal training, arousal reduction, relaxation therapy, psychosocial education and autogenic training may have positive effects in the management of chronic itch.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[16]](#SchutCMollanazarNKKupferJEtAl.Psych-D6E2BB33)
- **Education.** Training programs that teach coping mechanisms for the itch-scratch-itch cycle can be helpful.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4) However, accessing these services can be difficult due to lack of availability.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Topical therapy is the first choice for treatment of mild or localized itch. Systemic therapy is generally reserved for severe and generalized itch that has not responded to topical therapy.

### Moisturizers

Institute regular use of topical moisturizers in all patients with pruritus to help alleviate itch and prevent further aggravation of the skin due to dryness. Moisturizers also help repair the skin barrier and prevent ingress of irritants. Ointment-based moisturizers are more occlusive and help to retain moisture more effectively but creams are lighter and more cosmetically acceptable. Hydration of the skin after bathing can be retained by immediate application of moisturizers (e.g., fragrance-free mineral oil or moisturizing cream) after drying the skin. See also Dry Skin.

### Topical Antipruritics

Topical antipruritics may provide symptomatic relief in mild pruritus of various origins, keeping in mind that possible causative skin or systemic conditions should be diagnosed and treated appropriately (see [Table 1](#n00255) and [Figure 1](#c0070n00002)).

Colloidal oatmeal bath preparations​[[17]](#StullCLaveryMJYosipovitchG.Advances-F656ABA1)​[[18]](#PazyarNYaghoobiRKazerouniAEtAl.Oatm-49F9BC60) or adding 4 tablespoons of **baking soda** (sodium bicarbonate) to the bath can be soothing.

There is inadequate evidence to support the use of topical antihistamines available in Canada (e.g., diphenhydramine) for relief of pruritus.​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)​[[19]](#c0070n00196)​[[20]](#AndradeAKuahCYMartin-LopezJEEtAl.In-575E10B4) There are also concerns about allergic contact dermatitis and possible systemic absorption.

Menthol or camphor in a light, nonperfumed lotion are commonly used in dermatology for the alleviation of itch. Various strengths have been used historically despite a lack of good-quality, dose-ranging studies to support them: generally between 0.25–3% for menthol and 0.25–1% for camphor. These agents elicit a cooling sensation on the skin, which reduces the sensation of itch.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[21]](#c0070n00151) Patients reporting reduction in itching with application of cool compresses may benefit from topical therapies containing these agents.​[[21]](#c0070n00151)​[[22]](#c0070n00152) Menthol may be preferred as it is less toxic if systemically absorbed.​[[22]](#c0070n00152)​[[23]](#c0070n00199) Topical preparations of zinc oxide in concentrations of 10–50% can be useful in the treatment of localized pruritus due to its antipruritic and anti-inflammatory properties.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)

Small studies have suggested that topical anesthetics may be useful for some types of pruritus.​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)​[[25]](#HeAKwatraSGSharmaDEtAl.TheRoleOfTop-F653C082)​[[26]](#c0070n00153)​[[27]](#c0070n00154) Pramoxine 1% has low sensitizing potential; avoid topical benzocaine and other “caine” topical anesthetics, as they can sensitize the skin. ​[[25]](#HeAKwatraSGSharmaDEtAl.TheRoleOfTop-F653C082) Ketamine has been used topically in combination with amitriptyline and lidocaine in small studies.​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8) Consider use of topical anesthetics only when better-studied options have failed.​[[25]](#HeAKwatraSGSharmaDEtAl.TheRoleOfTop-F653C082)

Despite a lack of evidence, calamine is anecdotally useful. Its astringent properties may be helpful in blistering conditions, such as chickenpox and acute contact dermatitis, but it will dry the skin excessively with long-term use.

Topical corticosteroids are useful and appropriate only if the pruritus is caused by an inflammatory skin condition, which typically presents as visible redness along with symptoms of itch and/or tenderness. Urgent referral to a dermatologist is recommended if there is an extensive area of involvement, presence of erosions or blisters, or an adverse impact on quality of life. Choice of topical corticosteroid is based on factors such as location and extent of the eruption, severity and type of inflammation, age of the patient and anticipated duration of use. They are not recommended for chronic, generalized pruritus or for long periods of time.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[21]](#c0070n00151)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)

Topical immune modulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be useful in pruritus due to a variety of conditions​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8) (see Atopic Dermatitis).

Crisaborole is a topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that is effective for itch associated with atopic dermatitis.​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)

Capsaicin blocks transmission of itch along peripheral nerves and has been shown to have a beneficial effect in pruritus of various origins. It can cause a transient burning sensation on initial application, which can adversely affect the patient’s adherence to treatment. It must be used regularly to be effective.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[17]](#StullCLaveryMJYosipovitchG.Advances-F656ABA1)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)

### Systemic Therapy

If pruritus persists despite appropriate treatment of any underlying causative condition, systemic pharmacologic treatment may be useful (see [Table 3](#SystemicTherapyOfChronicPruritus-57F70D33)). The evolving understanding of the pathophysiology of pruritus has led to numerous different therapies being tried. Many of those discussed below have limited available evidence or results have not been confirmed with large, randomized trials.

**Table 3:** Systemic Therapy of Chronic Pruritus

| Medication | Types of Pruritus​[a] | Mechanism of Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anticonvulsants | gabapentin/pregabalin | aquagenic, CKD-related, older age–related, GPUO, neurogenic, refractory | Thought to be based on their ability to modulate calcium channels, inhibit glutamate synthesis and release, and/or inhibit GABAergic pathways in the central nervous system |
| carbamazepine | malignancy-related, neurogenic |
| Antidepressants | doxepin | CKD-related, hepatic/cholestatic-related, HIV-related, malignancy-related, psychogenic, refractory | Thought to be based on antagonizing histamine 1 (H1) and 2 (H2) receptors and blocking 5-HT reuptake Psycho-emotional factors can trigger or exacerbate chronic pruritus. Itch is a powerful stressor |
| SSRIs (fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) | CKD-related, GPUO, hepatic/cholestatic-related, malignancy-related, polycythemia vera |
| Antihistamines | Nonsedating (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine) | chronic urticaria, GPUO, mastocytosis | Block activation of peripheral H1 receptors in histamine-mediated itch |
| Sedating (e.g., chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) | palliative generalized, polycythemia vera | Block activation of peripheral H1 receptors in histamine-mediated pruritus and cause sedation due to also blocking activation of central nervous system H1 and cholinergic receptors |
| Beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol) |  | aquagenic, polycythemia vera | Possibly by blockade of overactivated neuronal sodium channels |
| Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, colsevelam) |  | CKD-related, hepatic/cholestatic-related, polycythemia vera | Presumed to be by reducing the concentration of bile acids or other anionic biliary constituents in the blood that lead to pruritus |
| Cimetidine |  | GPUO, malignancy-related, polycythemia vera | Thought to be related to H2 antagonism or through immunomodulatory effects |
| Immunosuppressants | azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil | chronic urticaria (cyclosporin), GPUO (particularly in the presence of immunosenescence) | Immunosuppressant effects lead to decreased inflammation (including itch) in inflammatory disease states |
| biologics | chronic urticaria (omalizumab), GPUO (dupilumab) |
| corticosteroids, systemic | chronic urticaria, malignancy-related, refractory |
| Iron supplementation |  | iron deficiency-related pruritus | Replaces iron stores |
| Montelukast |  | chronic urticaria, CKD-related | Leukotriene receptor antagonist resulting in decreased inflammation |
| NSAIDs | acetylsalicylic acid | polycythemia vera | Inhibit prostaglandins, which are thought to have a role in the development of pruritus |
| indomethacin | HIV-related |
| Ondansetron |  | GPUO | Serotonin antagonist thought to block opioid’s effect on 5-HT3 receptor |
| Opioid receptor agonists and antagonists | mu-opioid receptor antagonists (naltrexone, naloxone) | aquagenic, chronic urticaria, GPUO, hepatic/cholestatic-related | Modulate the imbalance of the endogenous opioid pathways that are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of pruritus |
| kappa-opioid receptor agonists (butorphanol, difelikefalin) | CKD-related (difelikefalin), GPUO |
| Rifampin |  | hepatic/cholestatic-related | Proposed mechanisms: inhibits uptake of bile acids by hepatocytes; induces 6-hydroxylation metabolism of bile acids by induction of CYP3A4; down-regulation of autotaxin |
| Substance P inhibitors | aprepitant | GPUO, malignancy-related | Substance P antagonist that blocks the action of neurokinin 1 (NK1), which has a physiologic role in the mediation of pruritus |
| capsaicin, topical | CKD, neurogenic | Blocks C-fibre conduction and inactivates neuropeptide release from peripheral nerve endings leading to localized antinociception and reduction of neurogenic inflammation |
| Thalidomide |  | CKD-related, hepatic/cholestatic-related, palliative generalized | Theorized to be due to its effect on various inflammatory mediators |

[a] Applications listed for each drug class/specific medication are summarized from recommendations in guidelines,​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D)​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8)​[[28]](#ZuberbierTLatiffAHAAbuzakoukMEtAl.T-5141CFB9)​[[29]](#SabroeRALawlorFGrattanCEHEtAl.Briti-51426CA4) which are in many cases based on low-level evidence. Refer to individual guidelines for more details and specific recommendations.

### Phototherapy

Phototherapy with UVA, UVB or PUVA (psoralens with ultraviolet A) has been used for various types of pruritus. It may help relieve itch through an immunomodulatory effect on localized or systemic inflammation.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)​[[24]](#SutariaNAdawiWGoldbergREtAl.ItchPat-4A06EDE8) The best evidence is for the use of broadband UVB in the treatment of pruritus secondary to chronic kidney disease.​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D) Other situations where phototherapy may be an option include pruritus that is hepatic/cholestatic–related, lymphoma-related, aquagenic or psychogenic, or due to polycythemia vera, HIV or CPUO.​[[3]](#MillingtonGWMCollinsALovellCREtAl.B-48F2557D) Phototherapy may be a useful option in older patients or in those who cannot tolerate systemic therapy.​[[10]](#WeisshaarESzwpietowskiJCDalgardFJEt-4905BAD4)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Pregnancy and Pruritus

There are a number of pruritic conditions specific to pregnancy, which should always be considered when evaluating a pregnant patient with pruritus: pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy. The assessment and management of these conditions is outside the scope of this chapter. With respect to possible changes in pre-existing pruritus during pregnancy, there is no consistent prognostic pattern, as it depends on how the underlying cause is affected by the pregnancy.

### Management of Pruritus during Pregnancy

General nonpharmacologic measures including avoidance of triggers and adequate skin moisturization are important for all patients with pruritus. Colloidal oatmeal baths and calamine lotion are generally considered safe during pregnancy. There are no reports of teratogenicity with topical use of menthol or camphor. Systemic absorption is minimal.​[[30]](#c0070n00186) Specialized sources suggest that limited topical use during pregnancy is not expected to pose significant risks to the fetus.​[[31]](#c0070n00225)​[[32]](#c0070n00188)​[[33]](#c0070n00189) The local anesthetics lidocaine and prilocaine are generally considered safe for use on small areas for short periods of time (e.g., to facilitate skin biopsy or dental procedures) since their absorption is low,​[[34]](#c0070n00249) but there is no information on safety of other dermatologic uses during pregnancy and these agents can cause skin sensitization. There is no information available about the safety of the less skin-sensitizing anesthetic pramoxine. However, since its systemic absorption is low, it does not appear to pose a significant risk to the fetus.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) Topical corticosteroids are useful only if pruritus is caused by an inflammatory skin condition. Except in the case of extensive use of the most potent agents, systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids is low and poses no known risk to the baby.​[[35]](#c0070n00191)​[[36]](#c0070n00192) There is no information available on the safety of crisaborole during human pregnancy; animal studies have not shown adverse effects.​[[37]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabase.xa-586F0CA9)​[[37]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabase.xa-586F0CA9) Topical capsaicin use is not recommended due to lack of information on safety in pregnancy.​[[33]](#c0070n00189) Topical therapy of pruritus during pregnancy is preferred whenever possible. Oral antihistamines are helpful in the specific case of urticaria. Cetirizine and loratadine are the nonsedating second-generation antihistamines of choice during pregnancy. Fexofenadine and desloratadine are safe alternatives.​[[38]](#c0070n00193) If the sedative side effect of a first-generation antihistamine is desired to improve sleep in patients with pruritus of any etiology, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine have the most evidence of safety in pregnancy.​[[33]](#c0070n00189)​[[38]](#c0070n00193)

The necessity of other systemic agents in the treatment of pruritus must include careful consideration of the risks versus benefits. Cholestyramine and colestipol are not absorbed systemically and therefore do not pose a direct risk to the fetus; however, long-term use may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the mother, leading to clinically significant deficiencies in the mother and fetus.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) Use of montelukast during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of major malformations.​[[39]](#SarkarMKorenGKalraSEtAl.Montelukast-0859EB0B)

Information on the use of SSRIs during pregnancy can be found in Depression. There is insufficient human data to determine if aprepitant, gabapentin or pregabalin can be used safely during pregnancy.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) Rifampin is used in the treatment of tuberculosis in pregnancy as no fetal harm has been reported; however, prophylactic vitamin K is recommended to prevent rifampin-induced hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) Limited data on the use of butorphanol and naloxone indicate a low risk to the fetus.​[[40]](#MotherToBabyFactsheets.Naloxoneinte-53D3A0C0) Safety of the use of naltrexone during pregnancy is unknown: animal studies suggest risk of behavioural abnormalities.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) There is no information available on the safety of difelikefalin during pregnancy.

### Management of Pruritus during Breastfeeding

For management of pruritus, patients should first maximize nonpharmacologic measures (e.g., use of moisturizers and avoidance of triggers). As a general precaution, care should be taken to avoid contact of the infant’s skin with any topically treated areas of the patient’s skin. Colloidal oatmeal baths and use of calamine lotion are considered safe while breastfeeding. Due to low systemic absorption, maternal use of topical menthol or camphor is unlikely to result in significant exposure to the infant via breast milk.​[[33]](#c0070n00189) Topical use of the local anesthetic lidocaine can cause skin sensitization in the patient but should not pose any risk to a breastfed baby, as even systemic use results in low amounts transferred into breast milk and poor absorption in the infant.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Due to insignificant systemic absorption, there is not expected to be any transfer of pramoxine (a local anesthetic with low sensitizing potential) into breast milk and therefore no risk to the infant during maternal use.​[[31]](#c0070n00225) Risk to the baby via passage of topical corticosteroids into breast milk is unlikely since only extensive use of the most potent corticosteroids causes systemic effects in the patient. The lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid should be applied to the smallest area possible for the shortest possible time.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) If applied to the areola/nipple area, wipe off prior to nursing. There is no information available about transfer of topical crisaborole into breast milk.​[[37]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabase.xa-586F0CA9) There is no information on the safety of topical capsaicin in breastfeeding, though exposure of the infant to significant quantities via breast milk is unlikely.​[[33]](#c0070n00189)

Use of oral second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, loratadine) for urticaria in people who are breastfeeding should not pose any risk to the baby.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Occasional small doses of first-generation antihistamines (chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) should not adversely affect a breastfed infant, but larger doses or prolonged use may lead to drowsiness in the infant or a decrease in the milk supply.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Cholestyramine and colestipol and montelukast are all considered safe to use while breastfeeding.

Information on the use of SSRIs during breastfeeding can be found in Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Gabapentin produces levels in breast milk that are likely too low to cause adverse effects in the neonate,​[[42]](#HaleTWRoweHE.MedicationsAndMothersM-094B9B77) though monitoring of the infant is recommended.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Limited data indicate that the amount of pregabalin in breast milk is low; more studies are needed to confirm safety.​[[43]](#LockwoodPAPauerLScavoneJMEtAl.ThePh-095654F0) Safety of aprepitant use during breastfeeding is unknown, although levels in milk are expected to be low.​[[42]](#HaleTWRoweHE.MedicationsAndMothersM-094B9B77) Rifampin levels in milk appear to be low and it is used in breastfeeding patients being treated for infectious conditions.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Although transfer of butorphanol into breast milk seems to be low and it is expected to be poorly orally absorbed by the infant, caution is advised due to lack of data.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) There is no information available on the transfer of naloxone into breast milk, but it is unlikely to be absorbed by a nursing infant via breast milk as it has no oral bioavailability.​[[41]](#c0070n00195) Naltrexone is minimally transferred into breast milk and, although limited data are available, sources suggest that its use is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding.​[[41]](#c0070n00195)​[[42]](#HaleTWRoweHE.MedicationsAndMothersM-094B9B77) There is no information available on the safety of difelikefalin during breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Dry skin leads to dermatitis, which can exacerbate other causes of pruritus. Use gentle cleansers (e.g., synthetic detergents) rather than soap to avoid drying skin further. Avoid hot water in baths and showers, as this leads to greater risk of irritation. Use moisturizers to repair disruptions in skin barrier and improve dryness.
- Avoid topical corticosteroids and immune modulators in the absence of clinically evident skin inflammation.
- Always check for burrows to evaluate for the possibility of scabies.
- Test for dermatographism or pressure sensitivity (urticarial lesion appears in site of superficial scratch on skin) because this common cause of pruritus can be suppressed with antihistamines. Consider regular daily use of nonsedating antihistamine with periodic tapering to determine ongoing need.
- Careful follow-up is required. The itching of scabies, urticaria and drug eruptions may precede onset of skin manifestations. Likewise, declarative symptoms of a systemic disease may eventually develop in a patient with pruritus.
- Topical agents may be kept in a refrigerator because the physical cooling enhances their antipruritic effect.
