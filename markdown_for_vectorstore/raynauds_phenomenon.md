### Introduction

Raynaud phenomenon refers to blanching of the digits, mainly when exposed to a cold environment, followed by a second cyanotic phase then by a reactive hyperemia phase. The classic presentation of Raynaud phenomenon is a combination of these phases and is often visible through colour changes. It typically progresses from white to blue to red in lightly pigmented skin. Colour changes in darkly pigmented skin may be more challenging to discern and may present as paler fingertips or colour changes on the palmar surfaces. The symptoms may last from a few minutes to up to an hour. Raynaud phenomenon may also be triggered by emotional stress and can affect other body parts e.g., nose, lips, ears, nipples. Raynaud phenomenon is thought to occur due to abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and cutaneous arterioles. In most instances, there is no other underlying disease, but in rare cases there is one, for example, scleroderma.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce frequency and severity of attacks
- Decrease symptoms (cold-induced blanching of the digits) in patients with primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon
- Prevent local and systemic deterioration in secondary Raynaud phenomenon
- Heal lesions in patients with secondary Raynaud phenomenon

### Investigations

The investigation of Raynaud phenomenon is summarized in [Figure 1](#c0034n00004).

- Thorough history to differentiate between:

  - *primary* Raynaud phenomenon (no associated illness or trauma)
  - *secondary* Raynaud phenomenon (secondary to occupational hazards, vascular diseases, connective tissue diseases [CTD], e.g., systemic sclerosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, hypothyroidism or other disorders)
  - secondary Raynaud phenomenon that may be *drug-induced* (see [Table 1](#c0034n00046))
- Physical examination for:

  - altered pulsations
  - abnormal Allen test, which is done by compressing both the radial and ulnar arteries while clenching the hand, then releasing compression alternately to demonstrate the patency of the arteries
  - local signs of CTD (e.g., sclerodactyly) and carpal tunnel syndrome
  - systemic signs of CTD (e.g., telangiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis), vascular diseases and hypothyroidism
  - evidence of digital ischemic lesions
- Laboratory tests:

  - nailfold capillary microscopy, where available, to detect megacapillaries and other abnormalities suggestive of systemic sclerosis. Capillaroscopy will help to diagnose early systemic sclerosis in patients with recent onset of Raynaud phenomenon, especially when the presentation is atypical or if symptoms suggestive of collagen vascular disease are suspected
  - antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA) and rheumatoid factor to detect CTD. Anticentromere antibodies (ACA) are specific for systemic sclerosis and, together with capillaroscopy, are the best markers to predict evolution toward systemic sclerosis​[[1]](#c0034n00065)
  - other tests (ESR, serum electrophoresis, cryoglobulins and all other immunologic tests) are less useful as early markers of secondary Raynaud phenomenon
  - normal test results suggest primary Raynaud phenomenon

**Table 1:** Drugs Implicated in Secondary Raynaud Phenomenon

| Drug | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Antineoplastic agents | Bleomycin-, cisplatin- and vinblastine-containing regimens |
| Beta-blockers | Unlikely but controversial; evidence implicating beta-blockers in Raynaud phenomenon is equivocal​ [2] |
| Central nervous system stimulants | Cocaine, dexamphetamine, methylphenidate |
| Cyclosporine | Not dose-related |
| Ergot derivatives | Bromocriptine, ergonovine maleate |
| Interferon alfa, beta | When used for treatment of cancer, viral hepatitis and multiple sclerosis; may persist for several months after withdrawal |

### Therapeutic Choices

The management of Raynaud phenomenon is summarized in [Figure 1](#c0034n00004).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Advise patients to minimize cold exposure.
- Avoid prescribing medications with vasoconstrictive potential (e.g., ergot derivatives, beta-blockers) unless there is a compelling reason, such as use of a beta-blocker in a patient with coronary artery disease.
- Reassure patients that no complications arise from primary Raynaud phenomenon.
- Teach warming exercises that may help terminate an attack, such as swinging the arms vigorously (windmill effect).
- Instruct patients to dress warmly (including the head and neck) to avoid a sympathetically mediated vasoconstrictive reflex and to use warming devices in mittens or boots if appropriate and affordable.
- Encourage patients to stop smoking and to avoid using vibrating tools (grinders, pneumatic hammers, drills, chainsaws).
- Note that acupuncture was ineffective in patients with secondary Raynaud phenomenon in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.​[[3]](#c0034n00013)

### Pharmacologic Choices

While there have been many negative studies of pharmacologic therapy for Raynaud phenomenon, these studies are often not published. This complicates the interpretation of the numerous small studies and case reports that report positive outcomes for a variety of drugs.

There are few evidence-based or consensus-based guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of Raynaud phenomenon. [Figure 1](#c0034n00004) and the drugs listed in [Table 2](#c0034n00001) are based on available evidence and the clinical experience of the author. Patients with primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon generally respond equally well to medications; it is the frequency of attacks, rather than intensity and duration, that is most likely to be reduced with effective drug therapy.

Dihydropyridine CCBs reduce the frequency of attacks in 40–60% of patients and are recommended as first-line agents in patients with primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon.​[[4]](#c0034n00014)​[[5]](#c0034n00484)​[[6]](#c0034n00015) Nifedipine is the best studied in this class.​[[6]](#c0034n00015) Patients with primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon may be advised to use a CCB of the dihydropyridine class (amlodipine, felodipine or nifedipine) 30−60 minutes before cold exposure or regularly during the winter months. If a dihydropyridine is not well tolerated, nondihydropyridine CCBs may be considered, although they are less effective for Raynaud phenomenon.​[[4]](#c0034n00014)​[[6]](#c0034n00015) Higher doses may be used in patients with severe primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon or if ulcers are present, e.g., systemic sclerosis.

Peripheral alpha-blockers (e.g., prazosin) are less effective than CCBs, although there are no head-to-head data to substantiate this opinion. Prazosin was more effective than placebo in patients with systemic sclerosis secondary to Raynaud phenomenon in 2 randomized trials.​[[7]](#c0034n00047) Hypotension is a common side effect that may be better tolerated if the drug is taken continuously.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antiplatelet agents and pentoxifylline are generally not effective for Raynaud phenomenon. The ARB losartan might be an alternative if CCBs are not tolerated, since some patients improved in a small trial.​[[8]](#DziadzioMDentonCPSmithREtAl.Losarta-2FE5781B) Nitroglycerin **2% ointment** can be tried, but may be difficult to use because it can cause headache and hypotension.​[[9]](#WigleyFMFlavahanNA.RaynaudsPhenomen-094CBE58) Other topical nitrate formulations with minimal systemic effects are currently being investigated, but are not commercially available.

Intravenous iloprost, a prostacyclin (PGI2) analogue, may be useful for short-term treatment of severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and in some cases increase the rate of digital ulcer healing; oral iloprost is less effective.​[[10]](#c0034n00048)​[[11]](#c0034n00049) Oral ketanserin (a serotonin receptor antagonist) reduces the duration of symptoms somewhat.​[[12]](#c0034n00050) Neither drug is commercially available in Canada.

Bosentan, an endothelin-1 inhibitor, heals digital ulcers and reduces the Raynaud phenomenon in select patients with systemic sclerosis.​[[13]](#c0034n00051)

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors reduce the severity of Raynaud phenomenon and may be effective in healing digital ulcers.​[[14]](#c0034n00052) Sildenafil 50 mg twice daily reduced the frequency and duration of Raynaud attacks in patients with severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon resistant to vasodilator therapy.​[[15]](#c0034n00053) Vardenafil 10 mg twice daily has been effective​[[16]](#c0034n00054) as well as tadalafil 20 mg on alternate days.​[[17]](#c0034n00066) Reducing the tadalafil dose to 5 mg daily improves tolerability and may still provide benefit.

PDE5 inhibitors and bosentan should be considered mainly for patients with severe primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon. These drugs are not currently approved for this indication, are costly, and have a number of contraindications and significant side effects. Specialist consultation is recommended before prescribing them.

Oral riociguat and local injections of botulinum toxin type A have been reported as potentially useful in very small studies comprised mostly of patients experiencing secondary Raynaud phenomenon.​[[18]](#HuntgeburthMKielingJWeimannGEtAlR-E41B75CF)​[[19]](#MedinaSGomez-ZubiaurAValdeolivas-Ca-E41B7882) Fluoxetine is suggested as a treatment by some authors, but its effectiveness is controversial and it is not recommended.​[[20]](#KhouriCGaillandTLepelleyMEtAl.Fluox-2FE5FD4D)

### Surgical Choices

- Extremity sympathectomy (surgical section of the sympathetic autonomous nerves), particularly by thoracoscopy, is not effective in the long term in patients with difficult secondary Raynaud phenomenon with digital ulcers.
- Digital sympathectomy may be more effective, although the evidence is very limited.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Raynaud and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Both primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon usually decrease substantially in frequency and intensity during pregnancy and for at least a few months after delivery. Most patients return to their prepregnancy state afterwards.

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

For the majority of patients whose Raynaud phenomenon improves during pregnancy, nonpharmacologic measures suffice (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0034n00009)). For those with persistent severe Raynaud usually related to systemic sclerosis, nifedipine can be considered if previous clear benefit has been experienced with 30 mg of the long-acting formulation. The fact that nifedipine reduces symptoms only and does not reduce complications such as digital ulcers should be discussed with the pregnant patient. Although nifedipine is not approved in Canada for use during pregnancy, there is considerable experience during pregnancy and the drug is considered safe.

### Raynaud and Breastfeeding

Nonpharmacologic measures are the mainstay of management of Raynaud phenomenon during breastfeeding. Avoid medications if possible. CCBs are passed on to the newborn via breast milk, but only in small amounts. Nifedipine can be used safely during breastfeeding. The benefits of other classes of drugs are not clear, so any risk to the breastfeeding infant is not justified.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Since pharmacologic prophylaxis of Raynaud phenomenon is effective in only 40–60% of patients, it is important to stress nonpharmacologic approaches and reassure patients. Only about 5% of patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon will go on to develop secondary Raynaud phenomenon. It is the underlying disease itself rather than the phenomenon that causes complications.
- Taking medication daily rather than as needed during the winter will increase tolerance to side effects, e.g., headache.
- If dihydropyridines are ineffective, other vasodilators are not likely to be effective.
