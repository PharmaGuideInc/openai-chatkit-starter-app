### Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infection is a nonspecific term used to describe a spectrum of acute infections that may involve the ear, nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx and trachea. These infections are common in adults and children and are generally caused by a virus (most commonly rhinovirus, parainfluenza). Most viral infections are self-limiting, resolve spontaneously and are managed symptomatically. Some patients who are at risk of complications of viral infections, including influenza (see [Table 1](#psc1022n01018)), SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) (see [Table 2](#1211-EED24039)) and respiratory syncytial virus (see [Table 3](#1231-78F8F3E7)), may require specific antiviral treatment. Bacterial infections or complications should be medically evaluated to determine the need for antibiotic therapy and further specific intervention. A differential diagnosis of common acute respiratory tract bacterial and viral infections is presented here.

**Table 1:** Persons at High Risk of Complications or Hospitalization Due to Influenza​[[1]](#psc1022n1014)

| Adults and children with chronic health conditions such as cardiac or pulmonary disorders, diabetes mellitus or other metabolic disease, cancer, immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, renal disease, anemia or hemoglobinopathy, neurologic or neurodevelopment conditions (includes neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions as well as seizure disorders, but excludes migraines and psychiatric conditions without neurological conditions), morbid obesity (BMI ≥40) Any resident of a nursing home or other chronic care facility, regardless of age Adults ≥65 years of age Children and adolescents with conditions treated for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid Children <5 years of age Pregnant individuals Indigenous peoples​ [a] |

[a] Indigenous populations in Canada are more vulnerable to influenza due to health inequities, such as poorer housing conditions, inadequate access to health care and remote or isolated living locations.​[[2]](#Determinants-8B65BF1C) The National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health acknowledges that addressing these inequities is key to reducing the risk of influenza infection and severe outcomes for members of Indigenous communities.

**Table 2:** Persons at High Risk of Complications or Hospitalization Due to COVID-19​[[3]](#COVID-19TreatmentGuidelines)[[4]](#GandhiRTLynchJBDelRioCMildOrModCOVID)

| Older adults (60 y, with greater incremental risk by increasing decades of life) Pregnant individuals Persons with Down syndrome Individuals who are not fully immunized against COVID-19 Persons with chronic medical conditions: asthma (moderate to severe); cardiovascular disease; dementia; diabetes; hypertension; lung, liver or kidney disease; stroke Persons who are immunocompromised (e.g., solid organ and blood stem cell transplant recipients, cancer patients, immunosuppressive therapy) Individuals with obesity (BMI >40) |

**Table 3:** Persons at High Risk of Complications or Hospitalization Due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus​[[5]](#CDCRSVrisk_7B097F58)

| Very young infants, especially if premature or ≤6 months of age Children <2 years of age with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease Children with weakened immune systems Children with neuromuscular disorders, including those who have difficulty clearing mucus secretions or swallowing Adults ≥65 years of age Adults with chronic heart or lung disease Adults who are immunocompromised Adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities |

### Patient Assessment

Viral and bacterial infections can be difficult to differentiate. Signs and symptoms, along with a medical history, can help determine the next steps for assessment and care (see [Figure 1](#AssessmentOfPatientsWithUpperRespir-F64C0D50)). Investigation for possible bacterial infection is indicated in the presence of fever lasting more than 72 hours, high fever, chills, severe sudden throat pain, prolonged congestion (>7 days), difficulty breathing, earache (especially in children) or double sickening (worsening after a few days of initial improvement).​[[6]](#psc1022n01023) The patient should be assessed for the presence of complications, the level of care required and the need for antibiotics.

See [Table 4](#psc1022n01021) for a comparison of common upper respiratory tract ailments.

When patients are afflicted with the common cold, they usually first complain of throat discomfort (dryness, scratchiness), followed by nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Nasal discharge is clear and watery at the beginning and becomes mucopurulent as the infection progresses. Cough may be present and may persist for 1–2 weeks. The cough is usually dry to start and often becomes productive. See also Viral Rhinitis.

With pharyngitis, the onset of throat pain is more rapid and the pain is more severe compared to the common cold. Acute sore throat infections, which include pharyngitis and tonsillitis, are usually viral in nature. However, when additional symptoms include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or rash, streptococcal throat infections should be suspected and treated accordingly. See also Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis and Viral Pharyngitis.

In the vast majority of cases, rhinosinusitis is viral in nature. However, bacterial involvement is suspected if symptoms persist >7 days or if symptoms worsen after initial improvement. Prolonged nasal congestion and purulent drainage are consistent with possible rhinosinusitis, especially if accompanied by fever, headache, facial swelling/redness, facial pain, and nausea and vomiting. See also Acute Rhinosinusitis.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses infections should be considered when patients present with fever, cough, sore throat, anosmia, or shortness of breath or have been exposed to high-risk contacts. Additional symptoms include muscle aches and headaches. The outcomes in affected patients can vary from asymptomatic infections to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is needed when symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 based on local epidemiology. Please consult local health authorities for updated recommendations. See also COVID-19.

Cough is present in most upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and COVID-19. However, it may be caused by other conditions, many of which require diagnosis by an appropriate health-care practitioner (see Acute Cough, Table 1). Cough persisting longer than 3 weeks should be assessed more thoroughly.

For more detailed information, see also Influenza, Viral Rhinitis, Acute Rhinosinusitis and Viral Pharyngitis.

The supraglottic larynx is a common site for airway obstruction. When infected, it can lead to croup, epiglottitis or supraglottitis mostly in children and rarely in adults. See also Croup. Otitis media can be confirmed on visualization of the middle ear and observation of bulging of the tympanic membrane. See alsoAcute Otitis Media in Childhood. It can be preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection that usually leads to bacterial involvement. Viral infections will often produce otitis media with effusion that should be differentiated from otitis media alone. The presence and colour of middle ear fluid that is more often dark yellow or red is a sign of otitis media with effusion. Symptoms suggestive of croup, epiglottitis or otitis media (see [Table 5](#psc1022n01020)) require further assessment for a tailored workup and treatment.

Allergic rhinitis can resemble the common cold but does not have an infectious etiology. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by sneezing and rhinorrhea that may progress to nasal congestion. Eye symptoms such as conjunctivitis and lacrimation may also be present. See Conjunctivitis and Allergic Rhinitis.
