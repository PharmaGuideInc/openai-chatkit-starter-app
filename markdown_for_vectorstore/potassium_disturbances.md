### Introduction

Potassium, the major intracellular cation in the human body, is found in abundance in fruit (e.g., bananas, oranges), vegetables (e.g., spinach, tomatoes), fish and meat. The average daily dietary intake is 50–100 mmol. Normal plasma potassium concentration is 3.5–5 mmol/L.

*Hypokalemia*, defined as a plasma potassium concentration of less than 3.5 mmol/L, can be mild (3–3.5 mmol/L), moderate (2.5–3 mmol/L) or severe (<2.5 mmol/L). *Hyperkalemia*, defined as a plasma concentration of greater than 5 mmol/L, can be mild (5–6 mmol/L), moderate (6.1–6.5 mmol/L) or severe (>6.5 mmol/L). Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. They can also cause musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric complications.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and improve neuromuscular conductivity
- Re-establish normal body stores of potassium (K​+) and prevent undue losses or accumulations
- Identify and correct underlying causes

### Investigations

- History with attention to possible etiology (see [Table 1](#c0087n00013))
- Physical examination to assess cardiac rhythm, muscle weakness, paresthesias, blood pressure (consider hyperaldosteronism in the presence of hypokalemia and high blood pressure) and total body sodium (which heavily influences potassium homeostasis)

  - total body sodium is assessed indirectly by examination of the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Edema, hypertension, elevation of the jugular venous pressure (JVP), ascites and pleural effusions are features of expansion of the ECFV. Loss of skin turgor, hypotension (especially postural changes) and decreased JVP are features of contraction of the ECFV
- ECG when clinically necessary, e.g., severe hypo- or hyperkalemia
- Laboratory tests may be useful in assessing hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, if the cause not already evident:

  - rule out pseudohyperkalemia (possible with thrombocytosis or severe leukocytosis). In these situations, the longer the blood stands, the greater the rise in serum potassium
  - rule out in vitro hemolysis or forearm contraction;​[[1]](#c0087n00208) hemolysis is common and requires that the test be repeated. Taking a blood sample without a tourniquet is a practical next step. Excessive forearm contraction increases venous K​+ due to repeated muscle depolarization–induced K​+ efflux exceeding reuptake via the Na​+/K​+-ATPase
  - urea, creatinine, Na​+, K​+, Cl​–, glucose
  - Mg​++ in refractory hypokalemia, especially when patient is at risk for hypomagnesemia, e.g., alcohol use disorder; diarrhea; or taking cisplatin, diuretics or proton pump inhibitor
  - arterial or venous blood gases or total CO2. Systemic pH has profound effects on K​+ movement in and out of cells
  - urine sample for Na​+, K​+, Cl​– and osmolality to calculate the transtubular K​+ concentration gradient (TTKG), the potassium-creatinine ratio and, in select cases, 24-hour urine collection for Na​+, K​+ and creatinine
  - aldosterone, cortisol, renin, screening tests for adrenal disease, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) for thyrotoxicosis, kidney ultrasound to assess size of kidneys, and renal artery imaging in select cases

### Hyperkalemia

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Stop K​+ supplements and/or drugs that induce hyperkalemia (see [Table 1](#c0087n00013)). If necessary, resume K​+ supplements at a reduced dose once the hyperkalemia is resolved.
- Reduce dietary K​+ intake to ≤60 mmol/day.

In mild hyperkalemia (plasma K​+ 5–6 mmol/L), these measures are usually sufficient, reducing K​+ in a few days. Increasing K​+ level, ongoing K​+ absorption, release of intracellular K​+ (e.g., red blood cell breakdown intravascularly, hematomas, GI bleeding) or kidney failure require further measures, e.g., hemodialysis.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Do not rely only on the plasma K​+ or ECG to determine the urgency of treatment. Though changes in the ECG have an uncertain diagnostic and prognostic significance, they are usually used as immediate evidence of a need for prompt treatment. Cardiac toxicity depends not only on the level of plasma K​+ but also on the rate of increase, chronicity of hyperkalemia, levels of other electrolytes (hypocalcemia, hyponatremia and acidosis increase cardiotoxicity) and cardiac irritability. Consider all of these factors.

In severe hyperkalemia (K​+ >6.5 mmol/L) or when significant or advanced ECG changes are present (loss of P waves or widening of QRS complexes), *continuous cardiac monitoring* should accompany treatment. Give **IV** calcium promptly and begin insulin. Monitor plasma glucose to avoid overtreating and causing hypoglycemia. Initiate K​+ removal simultaneously (see [Figure 1](#c0087n00003), [Table 2](#c0087n00031)).

In less severe situations, K​+ removal with or without redistribution agents (e.g., insulin) may be sufficient. Estimate kidney function and ongoing gain of K​+ in extracellular fluid. Initiate treatment early and more aggressively when kidney failure is present or there is rapid and severe release of intracellular K​+ (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome). Treatment can be less aggressive when there is slow or no input (e.g., hyperkalemia induced by K​+-sparing diuretics).

### Membrane Antagonists

**Calcium gluconate** or **calcium chloride** antagonize the adverse cardiac effects of K​+ and should be used in the presence of ECG changes or a high risk of cardiotoxicity since they are fast-acting. Calcium IV has a rapid onset but relatively short duration of action and should be administered simultaneously with other treatments.

### Redistribution Agents

These agents act for a longer period than membrane antagonists. Stimulation of insulin and beta receptors as well as correcting acidosis facilitates the reuptake of K​+ into cells.

When pharmacologic therapy is indicated (see [Figure 1](#c0087n00003)), insulin should be the first choice since it is known to be effective and has limited side effects.​[[2]](#c0087n00202) For severe hyperkalemia (K​+ >6.5 mmol/L), insulin must be administered as an IV bolus in conjunction with IV calcium.​[[3]](#c0087n00034) Use an insulin infusion if the situation is less urgent. Dextrose (50 g per 10 units insulin) is given to avoid hypoglycemia due to the effect of insulin, but do not administer too quickly because an acute increase in plasma tonicity can induce a rise in plasma K​+. Expect a 1–1.5 mmol/L fall in plasma K​+ in 60 minutes.

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is usually reserved for hyperkalemia associated with significant metabolic acidosis. It has a synergistic effect with insulin in the presence of mild acidosis.​[[4]](#c0087n00036) In the absence of low serum bicarbonate concentration or pH, sodium bicarbonate has a smaller effect.​[[5]](#c0087n00035) To avoid an acute increase in plasma K​+ induced by an osmolality change, hypertonic NaHCO3 solutions should not be used.​[[6]](#c0087n00218) The correction of acidosis in hypocalcemic patients may induce tetany. Insulin administration is faster, more reliable and more effective than sodium bicarbonate.​[[3]](#c0087n00034)

The beta2-agonist salbutamol is effective in lowering plasma K​+ by increasing activity of membrane-bound Na​+/K​+-ATPase activity.​[[2]](#c0087n00202) Concurrent administration of insulin and salbutamol has a synergistic effect.​[[7]](#c0087n00204) High doses of nebulized salbutamol have an effect similar to IV salbutamol;​[[8]](#c0087n00037) however, up to 50% of patients with chronic kidney failure are resistant to nebulized salbutamol.​[[9]](#c0087n00234) Administration using a metered-dose inhaler with spacer is also effective.​[[10]](#c0087n00235) Reserve salbutamol for patients at low risk of coronary artery disease or for life-threatening situations when other therapies have failed, because it is arrhythmogenic and has the potential to exacerbate angina.

### Potassium Removal

In patients with volume contraction and oliguria (prekidney disease), volume repletion should be implemented to quickly improve kidney K​+ excretion.

The administration of **loop** diuretics in patients with sufficient kidney function can significantly increase kidney K​+ excretion. Provide enough fluid with the diuretic to avoid volume contraction.

Administration of mineralocorticoids (e.g., **9-alpha-**fludrocortisone) may be necessary when urinary potassium excretion is markedly impaired. Assessing urinary potassium and sodium handling with a spot urine test is important in this situation.

If large amounts of K​+ must be removed rapidly, hemodialysis is the technique of choice. Because time is required to prepare the equipment and to insert a catheter, other treatments must be initiated while preparing for dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is far less efficient in acutely reducing plasma K​+. Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) are not efficient methods for removing K​+ in the short term.

### Potassium-Binding Agents

Potassium-binding agents can promote increased K​+ removal. Cation-exchange resins (sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene sulfonate) promote the exchange of Na​+ and Ca​++ for K​+, respectively, in the bowel; they also bind calcium and magnesium. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (**SZC**) is a nonpolymer compound that exchanges K​+ for sodium and hydrogen ions. Patiromer is a polymer that exchanges K​+ for calcium ions. The last 2 agents are more taste-tolerable compared to the resins, but are much more expensive. This should be considered when deciding between potassium binders.

Cation-exchange resins have widespread clinical use with apparent efficacy, but the K​+-lowering effect of single-dose resin-cathartic therapy is subject to debate.​[[2]](#c0087n00202)​[[11]](#c0087n00201)​[[12]](#c0087n00215)​[[13]](#c0087n00221) The addition of resins does not seem to increase bowel K​+ removal above the effect of the diarrhea induced by the simultaneous administration of osmotic or secretory cathartics.​[[14]](#c0087n00203) Because cation-exchange resins are constipating, it is suggested that they are given with a **laxative**.

Resins have serious side effects. The Na​+ released in exchange for K​+ may lead to volume overload. Rectal ulceration or colonic necrosis has been described when sodium polystyrene sulfonate mixed in sorbitol is given orally or by enema.​[[15]](#c0087n00039) Necrosis may be caused by sorbitol rather than by resins.​[[16]](#c0087n00040)​[[17]](#c0087n00041) The duration of drug contact with the mucosa may be a risk factor. A cleansing enema (sodium-free) is recommended to reduce this risk.

Given the potential problems with cation-exchange resins, some recommend trying all other alternatives for managing hyperkalemia first.​[[12]](#c0087n00215) Others feel that resins should continue to be used when indicated, preferably administered in water.​[[13]](#c0087n00221) Resins in sorbitol should not be used in the immediate postsurgical period or in patients with compromised GI function.​[[13]](#c0087n00221)

SZC and patiromer may also be helpful in the acute treatment of more severe hyperkalemia.​​[[18]](#KosiborodMPeacockWFPackhamDK.Sodium-8A326FEF)​[[19]](#BushinskyDAWilliamsGHPittBEtAl.Pati-8A3272D1)​ Evidence suggests SZC has a quicker onset of action and, therefore, may be more preferable in the acute setting. A dose-dependent onset of effect can be seen within the first hour; in contrast, patiromer alone demonstrated a reduction 7 hours after administration, reflecting its longer onset of action.​[[20]](#MeaneyCJBeccariMVYangYEtAl.Systemat-C1967B39)

In addition to treating acute severe hyperkalemia, cation-exchange resins have been shown to be effective in treating chronic mild hyperkalemia.​[[21]](#LepageLDufourACDoironJEtAl.Randomiz-8A326618) Both patiromer and SZC have also been shown to be effective for this indication.​[[22]](#WeirMRBakrisGLBushinskyDAEtAl.Patir-8A32699C)​[[23]](#PackhamDKRasmussenHSLavinPTEtAl.Sod-8A326D87)

SZC has been found to maintain normal serum K​+ in patients with CKD and those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors for up to 1 year. SZC is associated with dose-related mild to moderate edema that can be managed with dose reductions and/or with diuretic therapy.​[[22]](#WeirMRBakrisGLBushinskyDAEtAl.Patir-8A32699C)

Patiromer significantly reduces serum K​+ concentrations and facilitates use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with CKD and/or heart failure who either have or are at risk of hyperkalemia. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (constipation, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, flatulence) are the most common adverse effects associated with patiromer.​[[24]](#c0087n00205)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Focus the treatment of chronic hyperkalemia on the cause or pathophysiological mechanism (see [Table 1](#c0087n00013)). The treatments are similar to those used in acute hyperkalemia (diuretics, NaHCO3, potassium-binding agents).
- Closely monitor K​+ after introducing or changing the dose of any medication that could induce hyperkalemia such as ACE inhibitors, aliskiren, ARBs and K​+-sparing diuretics, particularly in patients at risk of hyperkalemia, e.g., kidney failure, older adults, cardiac insufficiency. Monitoring is even more important when a combination of these medications is prescribed (ACE inhibitor or ARB + spironolactone). In this case, measure K​+ 3 and 7 days after the introduction of these medications and after any change in the dose.​[[24]](#c0087n00205) In addition, measure creatinine and K​+ at 1 week, 4 weeks and, if stable, every 6 months thereafter.​[[25]](#c0087n00211)

### Hypokalemia

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- If clinically appropriate, reduce or stop medication that leads to K​+ loss.
- Determine and treat the etiology (see [Table 1](#c0087n00013), [Figure 2](#ManagementOfHypokalemia)). Assess dietary intake.
- If the deficit is mild (plasma K​+ 3–3.5 mmol/L) and there are no ongoing losses or clinical conditions warranting prompt treatment, dietary intake of potassium-rich foods should be adequate. If there are still unusual losses, K​+ supplements or K​+-sparing diuretics will be needed.

### Pharmacologic Choices

The appropriate pharmacologic approach is determined by:

- Relative urgency for treatment.
- The estimated total body deficit for an adult with plasma K​+ of 3 mmol/L is approximately 200–400 mmol and for plasma K​+ of 2 mmol/L, approximately 500–700 mmol. *Note:* The true deficit will be larger with an extracellular shift of K​+ (e.g., acidosis or insulin deficit) and smaller with an intracellular shift of K​+ (e.g., periodic paralysis or hyperadrenergic state).
- Ongoing losses must be added to the deficit when replacement therapy is planned. Kidney losses can be estimated based on urine K​+ levels and the volume excreted per hour.
- In the presence of kidney failure, the treatment should be more cautious.

### Potassium Salts

In most cases, potassium **chloride** (KCl) is the salt of choice (see [Table 3](#c0087n00027)), and oral administration is the preferred route. If there is no paralytic ileus or suspected absorption problem, oral administration of KCl can rapidly increase plasma K​+ (40–60 mmol of a liquid preparation will increase plasma K​+ by 1–1.5 mmol/L).

Reserve the alkalinizing salt potassium **citrate** for hypokalemic patients with metabolic acidosis (e.g., renal tubular acidosis, diarrhea). Potassium **phosphate** is used when severe hypophosphatemia is present.

*Reserve IV administration* of K​+ for patients requiring urgent treatment (e.g., respiratory muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias especially if digitalis is present, hepatic encephalopathy) or those unable to take oral supplements (e.g., postsurgery, paralytic ileus). To avoid sclerosis, IV K​+ should be administered via a large peripheral vein at a maximum concentration of 40–60 mmol/L. Administer higher concentrations via a central line with the catheter positioned away from the right atrium or ventricle to avoid direct effects on cardiac membrane potential. In patients with severe hypokalemia, administer K​+ in a dextrose-free solution to avoid stimulating insulin secretion and subsequent intracellular K​+ shift.​[[26]](#c0087n00046) Administering K​+ IV rather than PO is more likely to result in hyperkalemia. Thrombophlebitis and pain at site of injection are other risks.

The *rate of administration* depends on the urgency to treat (see [Table 3](#c0087n00027)). Protocols for the treatment of hypokalemia in the hospital setting have been proposed.​[[27]](#c0087n00216)​[[28]](#c0087n00217)

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

If increased kidney K​+ losses are involved in the pathogenesis of hypokalemia (e.g., hyperaldosteronism, concomitant use of other diuretics), **potassium-sparing** diuretics (see [Table 4](#c0087n00033)) may be used to decrease these losses; they also prevent or decrease magnesium losses. Amiloride, steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), (spironolactone and eplerenone) and triamterene (triamterene is available only in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in Canada) are equally effective but differ in side effects. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone may also be effective. Use an MRA in patients with primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism. The most frequent and serious side effect is hyperkalemia.

Avoid K​+-sparing diuretics in patients with kidney or adrenal insufficiency, older adults, patients with diabetes and patients taking other drugs that may increase plasma K​+ (see [Table 1](#c0087n00013)).

### Therapeutic Tips

- The goal in treatment of hypokalemia is to correct total body potassium homeostasis.
- Assess dietary potassium intake.
- Avoid the use of K​+ supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics together, as the risk of hyperkalemia is greatly increased. Combined use may be required temporarily at the beginning of replacement therapy if renal K​+ losses are very high; however, frequent monitoring of plasma K​+ is mandatory, and one of the drugs should be stopped when plasma K​+ reaches 3–3.5 mmol/L.
- Treat hypomagnesemia if present.
- If treating acute symptomatic hyponatremia, be cautious of administration of KCl as it will rapidly correct hyponatremia, which can result in serious neurological complications (i.e., osmotic demyelination). Both Na​+ and K​+ administration increase total body solute. Hyponatremia is an abnormality of total body tonicity; therefore, both cations and their obligate accompanying anions have equivalent effects on body tonicity.
- Where there is severe metabolic acidosis, especially diabetic ketoacidosis, correct potassium depletion before administering agents such insulin or bicarbonate as these agents can worsen hypokalemia.
