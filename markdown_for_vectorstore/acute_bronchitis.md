### Introduction

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms in primary care practice. Acute bronchitis is a condition characterized by the acute onset of cough (with or without sputum production) that is present for <3 weeks.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[2]](#c0091n00120) Acute bronchitis is a transient inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi​[[3]](#R1Kinkade-F932C4CD) and should be differentiated from viral rhinitis (the common cold), acute exacerbation of COPD, asthma and community-acquired pneumonia.​[[4]](#c0091n00118) Viral infection is present in >90% of uncomplicated acute bronchitis;​[[5]](#c0091n00038) see [Table 1](#c0091n00031) for more information regarding etiology.​[[4]](#c0091n00118)​[[6]](#R2ClarkT-F932CBB9)​[[7]](#R3CreerD-F932F0D8)​[[8]](#c0091n00039)​[[9]](#c0091n00040)​[[10]](#c0091n00128)

Acute bronchitis is generally self-limited and symptoms usually resolve in a median of 18 days,​[[11]](#R4EbellMH-F9331531) but cough can last for up to 8 weeks.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[12]](#c0091n00158) For cough lasting >8 weeks, see Chronic Cough in Adults.

| Etiology of Bronchitis | Frequency of Causation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Viral | >90% | Most common viral isolates in acute bronchitis based on age (in order of prevalence): <1 y: RSV, parainfluenza, coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2) 1–10 y: parainfluenza, enterovirus, RSV >10 y: influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, rhinovirus; less commonly adenovirus, coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2), enterovirus |
| Bacterial | 5–10% | The only isolates shown to cause acute bacterial bronchitis are Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis There is no evidence that Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis cause acute bronchitis in adults in the absence of underlying lung disease. There is a lack of strong evidence to support the concept of “acute bacterial bronchitis” |
| Noninfectious | Not well studied | Includes chemical and fume inhalational exposures, e.g., tobacco, other pulmonary irritants |

**Abbreviations:**

RSV
:   respiratory syncytial virus

SARS-CoV-2
:   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

### Goals of Therapy

- Rule out serious illness, e.g., acute exacerbation of COPD, asthma exacerbation, pertussis, pneumonia
- Minimize symptoms
- Limit unnecessary use of antibiotics

### Investigations

For the recommended approach to a patient presenting with acute cough (<3 wk), see [Figure 1](#c0091n00035).

- History:

  - primary symptom is cough, which may or may not be productive. Prolonged cough (>3 wk) can occur in up to 50% of cases due to viral infections.​[[8]](#c0091n00039) Transient bronchial hyper-responsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism underlying persistent cough.​[[14]](#R5Gonzales-F93370CE) Green sputum production is a function of peroxidase release from leukocytes; hence, it implies only inflammation, not necessarily infection​[[8]](#c0091n00039)​[[9]](#c0091n00040)​[[15]](#R6ButlerCC-F9337572)​[[16]](#R7Altiner-F93378AF)
  - in children, if there is a prolonged cough, it may indicate an infection of the tracheobronchial tree; in such cases, consider the diagnosis of reactive airways instead of acute bronchitis (see Asthma in Infants and Children). Consider a diagnosis of pertussis, especially in children, when a history of spasmodic cough is elicited, a known outbreak exists in the area or there has been prior travel in an outbreak area.​[[5]](#c0091n00038)

    If stridor is present, consider alternate diagnoses, e.g., foreign body aspiration, epiglottitis, croup
  - other symptoms may include nasal congestion, mild constitutional symptoms, wheezing, tachypnea, respiratory distress and hypoxemia
  - reconsider differential diagnoses if symptoms persist >3 weeks.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[4]](#c0091n00118)​[[8]](#c0091n00039) *Note*: cough duration with acute bronchitis can be up to 8 weeks in 50% of cases​[[8]](#c0091n00039)
  - obtain vaccination history, travel history, use of inhaled tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) or other substances, exposure to second-hand smoke, underlying pulmonary disease and comorbidities in order to rule out other causes of cough
- Physical exam is key to diagnosis:

  - normal heart rate (<100 beats/min), normal respiratory rate (adults <24 breaths/min), oral temperature <38°C and absence of localized chest findings on auscultation suggest acute bronchitis and eliminate the need for chest x-ray​[[2]](#c0091n00120)
  - in contrast, the best clinical predictors of pneumonia in adults are abnormal breath sounds and oral temperature >38°C (see Community-Acquired Pneumonia for more information).​[[17]](#c0091n00130) Some analyses have found physicians can be highly accurate in excluding pneumonia in adults based on history and physical exam alone (negative predictive value 96–100%)​[[18]](#c0091n00166)​[[19]](#c0091n00167)
  - clinical predictors of pneumonia in children include fever and tachypnea (2–12 months: >60 breaths/min; 1–5 years: >40 breaths/min; >5 years: >20 breaths/min) but these are not always present​[[20]](#c0091n00168)
- Objective measurements:

  - there is no role for routine investigations to be ordered (e.g., chest x-ray, viral culture, serologic assays, sputum culture, Gram stain, or pulmonary function testing/spirometry)​[[2]](#c0091n00120)​[[4]](#c0091n00118)​[[8]](#c0091n00039)
  - consider testing for COVID-19 (see COVID-19 for more information)
  - elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) has been associated with an increased likelihood of pneumonia in a large primary-care trial, but the clinical utility is inconclusive​[[3]](#R1Kinkade-F932C4CD)
  - procalcitonin, a serum biomarker helping to distinguish bacterial from other infection, can be useful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, but availability is a major limitation​[[21]](#R8Christ-Crain-F9337BD7)

### Therapeutic Choices

See [Figure 1](#c0091n00035) for the recommended management of acute bronchitis.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The nonpharmacologic approach is the mainstay of management:

- Patient education regarding the pathophysiology of acute bronchitis, including the duration of symptoms
- Avoidance of tobacco and other pulmonary irritants ​[[4]](#c0091n00118)
- Risk of inoculation and transmission can be limited by employing strict handwashing techniques and covering the cough​[[8]](#c0091n00039)
- Increased humidity may help reduce cough​[[8]](#c0091n00039)
- Increased fluids may prevent dehydration in children​[[10]](#c0091n00128) but, due to the lack of studies, there is no evidence to recommend in adults​[[22]](#c0091n00129)

### Pharmacologic Choices

No routine pharmacologic treatment is advocated in the management of acute bronchitis.​[[4]](#c0091n00118) Therapeutic options for symptomatic management of acute bronchitis are presented in [Table 3](#c0091n00036).

### Antipyretics and Analgesics

Antipyretics or analgesics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be used for symptomatic relief of fever, headache, myalgias or chest discomfort.​[[1]](#c0091n00037) The use of NSAIDs in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis has not been shown to reduce the severity or duration of cough.​[[23]](#c0091n00160)

In children, recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen only in the presence of fever.​[[10]](#c0091n00128)

### Antihistamines

Antihistamines have been found to be no more effective than placebo in reducing mean cough scores in adults who do not smoke or children with acute bronchitis, and have increased adverse effects.​[[24]](#R9WarkP-F9337F5A)​[[25]](#niceGuide)

### Antitussives and Nonprescription Cough and Cold Products

Mucolytic and expectorant preparations have failed to show any significant benefit in the management of acute bronchitis.​[[4]](#c0091n00118) A Cochrane review concluded there is no good evidence for the use of nonprescription medications in the treatment of acute cough in adults and children, as the studies are of varying quality with conflicting results;​[[26]](#c0091n00132) higher-quality studies are required.

In adults and children with acute cough, codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms.​[[25]](#niceGuide) Health Canada recommends against the use of opioid-containing cough and cold products (e.g., codeine, hydrocodone) in patients <18 years of age.​[[27]](#HCOpioids-1DF3CA71)

### Bronchodilators

Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs), e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline, are not recommended for routine use in acute bronchitis as they may cause adverse effects such as tremor and nervousness (number needed to harm [NNH] =2 patients).​[[28]](#R10CayleyW-F93382A2) However, in patients experiencing bronchial hyper-responsiveness, wheeze or FEV1 <80% of predicted values, they may reduce cough.​[[29]](#c0091n00152)

Studies in the pediatric population did not demonstrate any improvement in cough; however, trials excluded children with airflow obstruction.​[[29]](#c0091n00152)

### Corticosteroids

There is no available evidence to support the use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids in the management of acute bronchitis.​[[5]](#c0091n00038)​[[30]](#Hay-F941D20E) Furthermore, there is evidence against oral steroid use in patients with acute bronchitis.​[[31]](#R11Dvorin-F9338539)

### Antibiotics

Routine antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended,​[[2]](#c0091n00120)​[[5]](#c0091n00038)​[[25]](#niceGuide)​[[32]](#c0091n00042)​[[33]](#R12ChoosingWisely-F93388B3) since the etiology is viral in over 90% of cases. Antibiotic treatment does not have a consistent impact on the severity of illness, the clinical condition, or the prevention of potential complications, e.g., pneumonia.​[[8]](#c0091n00039)​[[32]](#c0091n00042) A Cochrane systematic review assessed 17 trials involving almost 5100 patients; overall, patients taking antibiotics showed only a modest benefit, if any, compared with placebo. Evidence suggests antibiotics may reduce the duration of cough by half a day; however, this marginal benefit for the treatment of a self-limited illness is offset by the potential for adverse reactions to antibiotics and an increase in antibiotic resistance (NNH = 24).​[[32]](#c0091n00042)

In an otherwise healthy patient who is clinically stable and with no apparent signs of bacterial pneumonia, the use of antibiotics is not recommended, even when a bacterial cause is suspected.​[[32]](#c0091n00042)​[[34]](#c0091n00165) There is no evidence that people who smoke but do not have lung disease are more likely to benefit from antibiotics than those who do not smoke.​[[24]](#R9WarkP-F9337F5A) Of note, prescribing antibiotics raises the likelihood of patients and their family members receiving additional antibiotics for future acute respiratory illnesses.​[[35]](#Shi-74A926D9)

See [Table 2](#TalkingPointsWhenPatientsRequestAnt-94EC3DE2) for tips on talking to patients who want antibiotics for acute bronchitis.

**Table 2:** Talking Points When Patients Request Antibiotics for Acute Bronchitis​​[[a]](#afn6915)

| Bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. Antibiotics do not kill viruses; they kill bacteria. Therefore, antibiotics will not reduce your symptoms of cough, phlegm or feeling unwell. Taking an antibiotic for your bronchitis will not prevent you from developing secondary infections such as pneumonia or sinusitis. Taking antibiotics too often or when you don’t need them can be harmful in several ways: side effects occur in 5–25% of people who take antibiotics (nausea, vomiting, vaginitis, oral thrush, Clostridioides difficile , allergic reactions); 1:1000 will have a serious side effect (e.g., allergic reaction) there is a cost to the health-care system of unnecessary treatment the antibiotic may not work the next time you need it; this is called antibiotic resistance Bronchitis is a chest cold that will take 2–3 weeks to resolve on its own. Measures you can take to help clear it include: Getting enough rest so your body can fight the virus Relieving your cough by drinking fluids, increasing humidity, using cough drops and avoiding things like smoke, which irritates your lungs Using nonprescription medications to reduce fever, nasal congestion and body aches Protecting others by washing your hands frequently and covering your mouth when you cough |

[a] Note: patient satisfaction does not depend on receiving an antibiotic; it is related to the quality of communication between the primary-care provider and the patient.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[9]](#c0091n00040)​[[36]](#c0091n00044)

### Natural Health Products

A Cochrane review found honey to be more effective than diphenhydramine, salbutamol and placebo, but no better than dextromethorphan, in improving cough frequency and severity in both adults and children.​[[37]](#c0091n00162) Due to the risk of botulism, honey should be pasteurized and given only to immunocompetent children >1 year of age.

*Pelargonium sidoides* (umckaloabo, South African geranium) is an herbal remedy that, according to some low-quality RCTs, may be effective in relieving symptoms in acute bronchitis.​[[38]](#c0091n00126) The preparation appears to be generally well tolerated, although allergic skin reactions, GI upset and liver toxicity have been reported. Recent studies suggest safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population, but current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use.​[[39]](#safetyPelargonium)​[[40]](#safePal2)

There is some evidence that **North American** ginseng extract taken prophylactically may reduce the duration of the common cold (see Viral Rhinitis).​[[41]](#c0091n00155) No studies have evaluated the effect of the extract on acute bronchitis.

Studies are ongoing with respect to Tropaeolum majus, a herb postulated to reduce symptoms in acute bronchitis.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of acute bronchitis.​[[3]](#R1Kinkade-F932C4CD)​[[42]](#c0091n00163)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

During pregnancy and breastfeeding, symptomatic management of acute bronchitis can be achieved via supportive measures similar to those used in the nonpregnant patient (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0091n00024)). Fever, headache and discomfort can be managed safely with acetaminophen.​[[43]](#c0091n00131) NSAIDs are not recommended in late pregnancy due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus;​[[44]](#c0091n00133) they are also not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to a potential reduction in amniotic fluid.​[[45]](#FDA-7139940F) If needed, cough may be controlled with dextromethorphan​[[46]](#c0091n00136)​[[47]](#c0091n00137) or opioids; however, opioids should be used cautiously near term. Health Canada and the United States FDA advise against the use of codeine during breastfeeding unless the benefits outweigh the risks (CNS and respiratory depression in the infant).​[[48]](#HC_CodeineInBF)​[[49]](#FDA_CodeineInBF) Controversy exists in the interpretation of the case report that was one of the bases for this recommendation;​[[50]](#Zipursky-34D6C9F1)​[[51]](#Pimlott-34D70611) until the controversy is resolved, it is reasonable to limit use of codeine in breastfeeding patients (for more information, see Drug Use during Breastfeeding). Inhaled **short-acting** beta2-adrenergic agonists (SABAs) are considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding but side effects need to be weighed against minimal symptomatic benefit.​[[52]](#c0091n00135)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- In the vast majority of acute bronchitis cases, treatment is supportive only.
- Patient satisfaction does not depend on receiving an antibiotic; it is related to the quality of communication between the primary-care provider and the patient.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[9]](#c0091n00040)​[[36]](#c0091n00044)
- Educate patients regarding the lack of evidence for the use of antibiotics in most circumstances. It is helpful to review the concerns of increased antibiotic resistance, possible side effects of antibiotic use and the cost of unnecessary treatment.​[[53]](#c0091n00045) Providing a patient-focused information handout may also reduce antibiotic use (see [Table 2](#TalkingPointsWhenPatientsRequestAnt-94EC3DE2)). Use of a decision-support tool (print or electronic) has been shown to reduce antibiotic overuse.​[[54]](#c0091n00164)
- Referring to acute bronchitis as a “chest cold” may help patients understand that their cough is due to a virus and that antibiotics are not necessary.
- Set the patient’s expectations for the duration of cough to be 2–3 weeks;​[[55]](#EbellMHLundgrenJYoungpairojS.HowLon-8ED89705) however, some patients may experience symptoms for up to 8 weeks.​[[1]](#c0091n00037)​[[12]](#c0091n00158) Although some patients feel much better within the first week, the average cough duration is 18 days.​[[33]](#R12ChoosingWisely-F93388B3) If the patient has unresolved symptoms >3 weeks from onset of symptoms, consider follow-up.
- Annual influenza vaccine is recommended in all individuals >6 months of age, especially those in high-risk groups (see Influenza). Follow [NACI recommendations](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci.html) regarding pneumonia and COVID-19 vaccinations (available from: www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci.html); see Community-Acquired Pneumonia and COVID-19 for more information.
- In those presenting with frequent or prolonged bouts of bronchitis, consider asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis or medication side effects (e.g., ACE inhibitor–induced cough).

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Analgesics/Antipyretics**

| acetaminophen ​ [b] Tempra , Tylenol , generics < $5 | Adults and children >12 y : 325– 650 mg Q4–6H PRN PO; maximum 4 g/day Children: 10– 15 mg/kg Q4–6H PRN PO; maximum 5 doses/day or 75 mg/kg/day or adult dose, whichever is less | Well tolerated; GI upset (rare), less than salicylates. | May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin, particularly with doses of >1.3 g/day for >1 wk . | Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic damage can occur with overdose. |
| ibuprofen ​ [b] Advil , Advil (Children's) , Motrin , Motrin (Children's) , generics < $5 | Adults: 200– 400 mg TID–QID PRN PO; maximum 2.4 g/day Children: 5– 10 mg/kg Q6–8H PRN PO; maximum 40 mg/kg/day or adult dose, whichever is less | Primarily GI (nausea, epigastric pain, heartburn). Possibility of increased blood pressure or GI bleed. | ASA/anticoagulants may increase risk of bleeding. | Contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Contraindicated in patients who have a history of or are at risk of ASA / NSAID intolerance (asthma, anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis). Caution in patients with decreased renal function, especially if taking diuretic and/or ACE inhibitor. Caution in patients with cardiac risk factors and those with uncontrolled blood pressure. In children, should only be used in the presence of fever. |

**Drug Class: Antitussives**

| codeine (many products contain additional ingredients) ​ [c] generics < $5 | Immediate-release: Adults: 10–20 mg Q4–6H PRN PO; maximum 120 mg/day Children <18 y : Health Canada recommends against the use of opioid-containing cough and cold products (e.g., codeine, hydrocodone) in children and youth​ [27] | Sedation, nausea/vomiting, constipation. | Additive sedation with other CNS depressants; use with caution. Inhibitors of CYP 2D6 (e.g., amiodarone, cimetidine, fluoxetine, moclobemide, paroxetine, quinidine) may antagonize codeine's effect. | Use with caution in pregnant, older or debilitated patients. Avoid in breastfeeding patients because of the risk of toxicity in the infant.​ [48] ​ [49] There is paucity of evidence for the use of codeine in acute bronchitis. Opioids (e.g., codeine, hydrocodone) are associated with increased adverse effects compared with other antitussives. Genetic polymorphisms cause some individuals to more rapidly metabolize codeine to its active form (morphine), resulting in potentially toxic levels. Conversely, others may not produce enough morphine for efficacy. |
| dextromethorphan ​ [b] Benylin DM , Robitussin DM , generics . Note: combination products are also available < $5 | Adults and children >12 y : 30 mg Q6–8H PRN PO; maximum 120 mg/day Children 6–12 y : 15 mg Q6–8H PO; maximum 60 mg/day For combination products: consult label for additional ingredients; follow dosing directions on label | Rare but can cause nausea, drowsiness, dizziness. | Caution with CNS depressants (can potentiate effects). Do not use with MAOI or for 2 wk after stopping MAOI . SSRIs may enhance adverse effects of dextromethorphan. | Not recommended in patients with asthma or children <6 y. |
| hydrocodone generics < $5 | Adults: 5 mg Q4–6H PRN PO; may increase to 10 mg/dose ; maximum 30 mg/day Children <18 y : Health Canada recommends against the use of opioid-containing cough and cold products (e.g., codeine, hydrocodone) in children and youth​ [27] | Lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting, constipation. | Additive sedation and risk of respiratory depression with other CNS depressants; use with caution. | Use with caution in pregnant, older or debilitated patients. Avoid in breastfeeding patients because of risk of toxicity in the infant. Opioids (e.g., codeine, hydrocodone) are associated with increased adverse effects compared with other antitussives. |

**Drug Class: Beta2-Adrenergic Agonists, short-acting**

| salbutamol Ventolin Diskus , Ventolin HFA , generics Diskus: $10–15 MDI: < $5 | Diskus ( 200 mcg /inhalation): Adults and children ≥4 y : 1 inhalation TID–QID PRN; maximum 800 mcg/day MDI: Adults and children ≥4 y : 1–2 puffs (100–200 mcg) QID PRN Maximum (adults and children ≥12 y ): 800 mcg/day Maximum (children <12 y ): 400 mcg/day | Tremor, restlessness, palpitations, dizziness, headache, nausea, hypokalemia, tachycardia. | Caution with other sympathomimetic agents. | Contraindicated in patients with arrhythmias or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
