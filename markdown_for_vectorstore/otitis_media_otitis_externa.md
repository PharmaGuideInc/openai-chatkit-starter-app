### Pathophysiology

Otitis externa, also known as swimmer’s ear, is defined as inflammation of the external auditory canal (EAC) and may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane (TM). Otitis externa is often caused by infection.​[[1]](#psc1020n01096)​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[4]](#psc1020n1011)​[[5]](#Wiegand)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867) Because the EAC is warm, dark and prone to becoming moist, it provides an excellent environment for bacteria or fungi to proliferate, particularly if the EAC is traumatized.

Otitis externa can be categorized as acute diffuse, acute localized, chronic, eczematous or necrotizing; see [Table 1](#OESignsSymptoms) for a description of each condition.​[[4]](#psc1020n1011)​[[5]](#Wiegand) The main focus of this chapter is ***acute diffuse otitis externa***, which is the most common form.

For a discussion regarding acute otitis media, see Acute Otitis Media in Childhood.

### Goals of Therapy

The goals of therapy for acute diffuse otitis externa include:

- Eliminate pathogenic microorganisms
- Remove debris
- Control pain and otorrhea
- Restore the canal to normal health so it resists infection—returning it to normal acidic pH and adequate cerumen

### Patient Assessment

Acute diffuse otitis externa is characterized by the acute onset (within 48 h) of otalgia (70% of cases), itching (60%) or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%), and discharge in or coming from the ear (otorrhea).​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867)​[[8]](#BarryBMJ)​[[11]](#psc1020n1009)​[[12]](#actionJackson) Incidence peaks in children 7–12 years of age and declines after 50.​[[11]](#psc1020n1009) It is unilateral in 90% of cases.​[[11]](#psc1020n1009) The discomfort can range from pruritus to severe pain, and pain is often worse with motion of the ear (pushing the tragus or pulling the pinna),​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[5]](#Wiegand)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867) including movement caused by chewing.​[[3]](#psc1020n01097) Determining the type of otitis externa (infectious vs. noninfectious) is assisted by the description of the signs and symptoms, the presence of contributing factors (e.g., history of swimming or trauma to the EAC) or the presence of dermatologic conditions on areas of the body other than the EAC; for more information, see [Table 1](#OESignsSymptoms).

**Table 1:** Comparison of Otitis Externa Conditions

| Condition | Etiology | Signs and Symptoms | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acute diffuse OE​ [1] ​ [2] ​ [3] ​ [5] ​ [6] ​ [7] ​ [12] | Most common etiology: bacterial infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20–60%) or Staphylococcus aureus (10–70%) ;​ [2] ​ [3] ​ [5] ​ [8] However, up to one-third of cases are polymicrobial.​ [1] ​ [12] Fungal OE occurs rarely; it may be asymptomatic or may produce pruritus and fullness in the ear. It classically occurs in the immunocompromised or after prolonged antibiotic treatment of bacterial OE, which alters the bacterial flora of the EAC.​ [2] The EAC may contain black, grey, bluish-green, yellow or white fungal elements and debris.​ [1] Diagnosis is clinical; culture of the external canal or drainage is reserved for severe or recurrent cases or in patients who are immunocompromised or have recently undergone surgery. | Otalgia—worse with motion of tragus or pinna and chewing Otorrhea Pruritus Fullness Conductive hearing loss Cellulitis of the pinna and regional lymphadenopathy may be present Symptoms may be more intense in bacterial cases compared with fungal cases. | Predisposing factors for acute diffuse OE include:​ [1] ​ [2] ​ [3] ​ [5] ​ [6] ​ [7] ​ [8] ​ [9] Too little cerumen—cerumen provides antibacterial action by physically protecting the canal and maintaining a low pH Too much cerumen, which can lead to occlusion and maceration Moisture (swimming, bathing, water sports, perspiration, increased humidity), which macerates underlying skin, raises pH and encourages bacterial growth Trauma to the EAC (caused by fingernails, cotton-tipped swabs, other foreign objects, overzealous wax removal)—abrasion and laceration allowing inoculation of organisms Chronic dermatologic disorders, e.g., atopic, seborrheic or contact dermatitis; psoriasis; lupus erythematosus; neurodermatitis; infantile eczema Hearing aids and, theoretically, earbuds (though data is lacking) Narrow, hairy ear canal |
| Acute localized OE (furunculosis)​ [1] ​ [5] ​ [12] | Acute localized “boil” (infected hair follicle) in the ear canal usually due to S. aureus .​ [5] | Localized pain, which subsides when the boil comes to a head and bursts Pruritus Edema Erythema In some cases: a fluctuance or abscess | Topical mupirocin or fusidic acid can be used for mild cases. In more severe cases, systemic antibiotics active against S. aureus should be considered.​ [2] For more severe cases or those appearing to need incision and drainage, refer to a health-care practitioner with appropriate training. |
| Chronic OE​ [1] ​ [5] ​ [6] ​ [12] | Defined as OE lasting longer than 3 months or more than 4 episodes of OE per year. Often due to nonbacterial causes, such as dermatological conditions, e.g., allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis. | Unrelenting pruritus Mild discomfort Flaky skin in the EAC Conductive hearing loss Unusual: pain | If due to nonbacterial causes, treatment is primarily management of the underlying condition. |
| Eczematous OE​ [1] ​ [2] ​ [5] ​ [10] | Due to a variety of skin conditions, e.g., atopic, seborrheic or contact dermatitis; acne; psoriasis; lupus erythematosus; neurodermatitis; infantile eczema. | Most common: pruritus, erythema, edema, crusting and oozing Lesion appearance and symptoms depend on the cause (e.g., atopic, seborrheic or contact dermatitis; psoriasis; lupus erythematosus) and resemble those occurring elsewhere on the body as well as the auricle and EAC Lesions may become secondarily infected with bacteria or fungi Appearance may range from mild erythema and scaling with atopic dermatitis to the typical adherent scales of psoriasis (see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis ; Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis as well as Psoriasis for a more complete description of the lesions) | Treatment is primarily management of the underlying condition.​ [1] ​ [10] Specific notes for contact dermatitis on or in the ears: Grooming products (e.g., shampoos, hair sprays, hair dyes) are common allergens​ [2] Hearing aids and earplugs may cause contact dermatitis of EAC Topical neomycin can commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis; cross reaction to tobramycin may occur in some patients Other common causes: benzalkonium chloride, benzocaine, propylene glycol​ [21] Management: avoid offending agent(s); symptomatic treatment with topical corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor​ [2] |
| Necrotizing (malignant) OE​ [1] ​ [3] ​ [5] ​ [6] ​ [7] ​ [12] | Rare infection that extends to the mastoid or temporal bone. Usually seen in immunocompromised patients or those with diabetes. | Severe otalgia Fetid otorrhea Conductive hearing loss Fever Granulation tissue or necrotic tissue in the ear canal In some cases: cranial nerve involvement | Urgent referral and systemic antimicrobial therapy are required. Further discussion is outside the scope of this chapter. |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Adequate cleansing of the ear canal with removal of debris may be required frequently so that topical therapy can be effective; however, it is not often done in primary care settings.​[[1]](#psc1020n01096)​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[5]](#Wiegand) If the canal is not patent, ear wicks may be inserted by a health-care practitioner to reduce edema and swelling and provide a mechanism for drug delivery to the canal.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867) These may remain in place for 2–5 days. Cleansing of the EAC must be done by a health-care practitioner with appropriate training; it is performed under microscopic vision with lavage suction or an aural hook.​[[1]](#psc1020n01096)​[[5]](#Wiegand)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Otic Products. For information on correct instillation of ear drops, see [Proper Use of Ear Drops—What You Need to Know](#pieardrops).

Topical treatment is the mainstay of therapy for acute diffuse otitis externa, although systemic antibiotics may be required in more severe cases: when infection has spread beyond the EAC (e.g., cellulitis), when otitis media coexists or if the patient is at increased risk of infection, e.g., diabetes, immunodeficiency.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[5]](#Wiegand)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867)​[[8]](#BarryBMJ) In uncomplicated cases, systemic therapy does not improve outcomes compared with topical therapy and it increases time to clinical cure and the risk of both adverse effects and antibiotic resistance.​[[13]](#psc1020n01099) Topical therapy options include acidifying agents and **antibiotics** (monotherapy or in combination with a **corticosteroid**; see [Table 2](#d2e903)). Comparative trials show similar outcomes among approaches; therefore, the choice is determined by health-care practitioner and patient preference, the side effect profile of the agents, and cost.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[4]](#psc1020n1011)​[[5]](#Wiegand)​[[12]](#actionJackson)​[[14]](#psc1020n1014)​[[15]](#psc1020n1017)​[[16]](#DiTragliaRTudor-GreenBMuzaffarJEtAl-B305F862) Efficacy was comparable between acetic acid and an antibiotic/corticosteroid combination if symptoms lasted ≤1 week; however, acetic acid was less effective if symptoms lasted >1 week.​[[14]](#psc1020n1014) Furthermore, 1 trial demonstrated that corticosteroid drops (with either acetic acid or antibiotic) were more effective than acetic acid alone and recommended that acetic acid alone not be used in adult patients.​[[17]](#psc1020n1015) Advantages and disadvantages of the various products are outlined in [Table 2](#d2e903).

Antibiotic drops are available as both otic and ophthalmic preparations. Both nonprescription and prescription products are available. Otic products are more acidic than ophthalmic preparations and may cause burning on instillation. If a patient cannot tolerate otic preparations, ophthalmic preparations may be more comfortable.​[[18]](#psc1020n1020) Preparations may also contain corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation and edema and may resolve symptoms more quickly; however, this has not been shown in all studies and corticosteroids may occasionally be topical sensitizers.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)

One particular concern with topical therapy is the potential ototoxicity of aminoglycosides.​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867)​[[19]](#psc1020n1018) This is a documented adverse effect of systemically administered aminoglycosides. If the tympanic membrane is intact, the risk with topical administration is extremely small. Risk factors for ototoxicity include ruptured tympanic membrane (including tympanostomy tubes), use of the product for more than 1 week and continued use after otorrhea has subsided. Topical fluoroquinolones have not been associated with ototoxicity; however, fluoroquinolones may be associated with tympanic membrane perforation, which should be considered in the risk-to-benefit assessment of the use of antibiotic drops for self-limiting conditions.​[[20]](#WangCID)

When administering topical treatment, enough liquid to fill the canal (3–4 drops) should be instilled 3–4 times daily (for most products; exception is fluoroquinolones, which are dosed twice daily). In 65–90% of patients, clinical resolution occurs in 7–10 days;​[[2]](#psc1020n1010) however, improvement in symptoms often occurs within 48–72 hours.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867) Although the optimal duration of therapy is controversial, topical treatment is usually recommended for 7–10 days.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010) If symptoms are not completely resolved after 7–10 days, therapy can be continued until a few days beyond symptom resolution (up to 2 wk).​[[14]](#psc1020n1014)

Fungal otitis externa often responds to cleansing and acidification alone, although topical antifungal agents (clioquinol, clotrimazole, tolnaftate) may also be used.​[[11]](#psc1020n1009) Some preparations may need to be compounded.

Otitis externa can be very painful. Usual doses of acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen **sodium** can be used for analgesia (ASA can be used in adults).​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[5]](#Wiegand)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)​[[7]](#PlumAWWongM.AnOverviewOfAcuteOtitis-B3043867)​[[12]](#actionJackson) Although some otic preparations contain topical anesthetics, the efficacy of these agents has not been determined in acute otitis externa, and topical hypersensitivity reactions can occur.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010) If topical anesthetic agents are used in addition to other topical therapy, this will dilute the acidifier or antibiotic present in the canal; avoid their use in otitis externa. Systemic analgesia is preferred.

### Prevention of Recurrence

Provide information on how to prevent a recurrence to individuals who develop acute diffuse otitis externa:

- After swimming or bathing, dry the external canal with a blow dryer set on low or by instillation of acidifying or alcohol drops.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)​[[11]](#psc1020n1009)
- Avoid overzealous cleansing and scratching (trauma) of the ear canal.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[6]](#EllisJDeLaLisARosenEEtAl.ApproachTo-B3043531)
- If possible, limit earbuds/hearing aids until resolution of symptoms; remove these items at night and clean frequently.
- Avoid cotton-tipped swabs.​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[11]](#psc1020n1009)​[[22]](#psc1020n1023)
- Avoid water sports for at least 7–10 days during treatment.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)
- Earplugs and bathing caps may be used to keep the ears dry; however, there is little evidence to guide recommendations.​[[2]](#psc1020n1010) Frequent use of earplugs may also act as a local irritant and promote infection.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Symptoms should be significantly reduced within 48–72 hours of therapy​[[2]](#psc1020n1010)​[[3]](#psc1020n01097)​[[5]](#Wiegand) and completely resolved in 1 week for most patients. Occasionally up to 14 days of treatment is needed.​[[14]](#psc1020n1014) Follow up with the patient in 3–5 days to ensure symptoms are improving and at the end of treatment to ensure resolution. If symptoms worsen or do not resolve, consider the following: medication reaction (contact dermatitis); development of a superinfection; incorrect diagnosis; improper or infrequent use of ear drops; inadequate penetration of topical agents due to debris or narrowing of the canal; immunosuppression or malignant otitis externa; or organism not susceptible to topical agent selected.​[[1]](#psc1020n01096)​[[2]](#psc1020n1010) Assessment for further treatment will be required.

### Advice for the Patient

Advise patients on:

- Prevention of recurrences
- Methods of pain control
- Correct use of ear drops (see “Proper Use of Ear Drops—What You Need to Know” patient handout)
- Possible side effects of treatment and their management (see [Table 2](#d2e903))
- When to see a health-care practitioner
