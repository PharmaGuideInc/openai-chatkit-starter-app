### Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder defined only by its symptoms, which include the presence of abdominal pain associated with defecation and altered bowel habits at the exclusion of an organic cause.​[[1]](#CheyWDKurlanderJEswaranS.IrritableB-788FA925) Patients with IBS may experience diarrhea, constipation or both, with symptom frequency determining the IBS subtype. In many patients, symptoms fluctuate over time and migrate between the different IBS subtypes.​[[2]](#EngsbroALSimrenMBytzerP.Short-termS-78904036)

The pathophysiology of IBS is not well understood and is likely multifactorial. Classified as a disorder of the gut-brain interaction, there is evidence that the pathogenesis may include inflammatory, environmental, psychological and dietary factors as well as alterations of intestinal microbiota.​[[3]](#El-SalhyM.IrritableBowelSyndromeDia-7890A17E)​[[4]](#DrossmanDA.FunctionalGastrointestin-78909285) Since there are no known biomarkers for IBS, the diagnosis is clinical.

IBS is a common condition with an estimated prevalence of 12% in North America, where symptoms are 1.5 to 2 times more frequent among females than males.​[[5]](#LovellRMFordAC.EffectOfGenderOnPrev-78901127)​[[6]](#LovellRMFordAC.GlobalPrevalenceOfAn-788FD621) While only some patients with IBS seek medical care,​[[7]](#KoloskiNATalleyNJBoycePM.Predictors-789051B3) it is the fourth most expensive digestive disease in Canada with an estimated economic and health-care burden exceeding $6.5 billion per year.​[[8]](#CanadianDigestiveHealthFoundation.I-78905F58)

### Goals of Therapy

- Develop a strong patient-physician relationship
- Alleviate symptoms by establishing a treatment plan tailored to the patient
- Treat psychosocial comorbidity, if present
- Improve quality of life
- Promote coping and normal social and occupational functioning

### Investigations

- Established in 1972, the diagnostic criteria for IBS have evolved, with the Rome IV being the most current (see [Table 1](#c0049n00004)).​[[4]](#DrossmanDA.FunctionalGastrointestin-78909285) Establishing diagnostic criteria in IBS is essential to provide a standardized definition of IBS in research settings. In actual practice, such criteria serve as a framework for establishing a diagnosis, although some patients who do not exactly meet the diagnostic criteria might still benefit from recommended treatments.

**Table 1:** Rome IV: Diagnostic Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome​[[4]](#DrossmanDA.FunctionalGastrointestin-78909285)

| Recurrent abdominal pain ≥1 day/week in the last 3 months associated with 2 or more of the following criteria: Related to defecation Associated with a change in frequency of stool Associated with a change in appearance of stool Symptom onset should be at least 6 months prior to diagnosis. |

- A thorough history is required to identify the presence of specific GI symptoms in the absence of any other GI disease.​[[9]](#LacyBEMearinFChangLEtAl.BowelDisord-78906A2A) Patinet history should include inquiries regarding:
  - frequency of bowel movements and appearance of stool
  - symptoms of abdominal pain, frequency, severity, and duration and any associated bloating, distention or flatulence
  - potential triggers for symptoms, i.e., personal stress, relationship issues, diet
  - family history of IBS or GI disorders
  - medical history including comorbid conditions, e.g., gynecological, urological
  - medications that may be contributing to symptoms
- A physical examination in patients with IBS is usually unremarkable but mild abdominal tenderness may be present.​[[10]](#refitem-1222110-82D4B43B) It is important to consider alarm signs or symptoms that identify patients who should undergo further investigations to exclude other organic conditions explaining their symptoms (see [Table 2](#c0049n00007)). Microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, bile acid malabsorption and lactose intolerance share similar symptoms to IBS, especially those with diarrhea and mixed pattern bowel habits.​[[1]](#CheyWDKurlanderJEswaranS.IrritableB-788FA925) Colorectal cancer is a common concern and is within the differential diagnosis of IBS, especially in constipation subtype.​[[11]](#Guxe9rinAModyRFokBEtAl.RiskOfDevelo-7890AF62)

- In the absence of alarm signs and symptoms, the routine use of diagnostic tests may be kept to a minimum when diagnosing IBS.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) Most patients <50 years of age have a low probability of having an alternate organic disease.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) Regardless, specific tests should be carried out based on individual signs and symptoms and clinical suspicion (see [Table 3](#c0049n10072)). Referral to a gastroenterologist may be indicated if alarm features are present or management strategies are ineffective.​[[10]](#refitem-1222110-82D4B43B)

**Table 2:** Alarm Signs and Symptoms Not Explained by IBS​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28)

| Abdominal mass Ascites Blood in stool, i.e., melena Elevated white blood cell count Family history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease Fever Nocturnal diarrhea Recent change in symptoms or bowel habits Symptom onset after 50 y of age Severe, progressive worsening of symptoms Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia Unexplained weight loss and/or loss of appetite |

**Table 3:** Further Testing in IBS Patients

| Complete blood cell count (to assess for anemia or inflammation) CRP and fecal calprotectin (only if IBD suspected) IgA TTG (to rule out celiac disease) and/or duodenal biopsies (if iron-deficiency anemia) Colonoscopy (in GI bleeding, unexplained weight loss, family history of colon cancer and/or abdominal mass, or >50 y of age) Consider random biopsies in diarrhea to rule out microscopic colitis SeHCAT (drug used to diagnose bile acid malabsorption), fecal bile acids or trial with cholestyramine (to rule out bile acid malabsorption) Plain film of the abdomen (to rule out fecal loading) Motility test (to identify origin of constipation) |

**Abbreviations:**

CRP

- IBS subtype can be identified based on stool consistency through the Bristol stool form scale, a validated instrument that allows reporting of stool appearance on a scale of 1 to 7. A score of 1 corresponds with hard-to-pass and lumpy stool (slow GI transit) and 7 corresponds to entirely liquid stool (fast GI transit) (see [Figure 1](#bristol)).

  The 3 main subtypes of IBS are:

  - **IBS with predominant constipation** (IBS-C)—stool type 1–2 from the Bristol stool form scale more than 25% of the time and stool type 6–7 less than 25% of the time.
  - **IBS with predominant diarrhea** (IBS-D)—stool type 6–7 from the Bristol stool form scale more than 25% of the time and stool type 1–2 less than 25% of the time.
  - **IBS with mixed bowel pattern** (IBS-M)—stool type 1–2 from the Bristol stool form scale more than 25% of the time and stool type 6–7 more than 25% of the time.

  People whose symptoms do not fit into any category are considered to have IBS unclassified (IBS-U).​[[9]](#LacyBEMearinFChangLEtAl.BowelDisord-78906A2A) IBS subtypes are not separate conditions and the quantity, intensity and severity of symptoms may vary from patient to patient.​[[4]](#DrossmanDA.FunctionalGastrointestin-78909285) Therefore, the IBS subtype should ideally be re-categorized as a person’s bowel habits change.

### Therapeutic Choices

There are different approaches for the management of IBS patients, which involve nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies; a stepwise management approach is usually advocated for IBS patients. Nonpharmacologic therapies are sufficient for some, while other patients who have moderate to severe symptoms may not be satisfied with this approach and may require pharmacologic therapies.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

A good physician-patient relationship can have a positive impact on the quality of life of a patient with IBS.​[[13]](#refitem-1202114-80C10872) Patient education is central to management and includes discussions regarding diagnosis and prognosis as well as the acknowledgement of fears; providing reassurance may help patients make sense of symptoms and cope long-term. The more time spent establishing a strong patient-physician relationship, the greater the chance of finding an effective management strategy.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) A multidisciplinary approach to treatment (e.g., including a pharmacist, psychologist and dietician) is suggested in the treatment of IBS. Nonpharmacologic treatment options for IBS are outlined in [Figure 2](#nonpharm).

**Figure 2:** Nonpharmacologic Treatment of IBS

![](images/irritablebowelsyndrome_nonphatreibs.gif)

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad763986e592) Key factors that can help build physician-patient relationship:  
1. Active listening to patient's concerns  
2. Not interrupting  
3. Using empathy  
4. Setting realistic patient expectations  
5. Using non-verbal techniques such as eye contact and open body posture.

**Abbreviations:**

GFD
:   gluten-free diet

FODMAP
:   fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols

### Lifestyle Interventions

Lifestyle interventions include promoting increased physical activity and encouraging patient to reduce consumption of caffeine and alcohol.

- *Physical activity:* a study involving a 12-week intervention followed by a continued moderate increase in physical activity demonstrated long-term positive effects on IBS and associated psychological symptoms.​[[14]](#JohannessonERingstromGAbrahamssonHE-7890DDCD)
- *Caffeine intake:* Caffeinated coffee has been demonstrated to increase gastric acid secretion and colonic motor activity in healthy individuals, but the effect of caffeine on IBS is not clear. Therefore, recommendations for caffeine intake in IBS are similar as for the general population with 400 mg/day considered a safe limit.​[[15]](#Cozma-Petrux163ALoghinFMiereDEtAl.D-7890F6A2)
- *Alcohol consumption:* the role of alcohol in IBS has been debated and symptoms appear to be related to the drinking pattern. Binge drinking, but not moderate or light alcohol intake, has been associated with increased GI symptoms, particularly among females with IBS-D.​[[16]](#RedingKWCainKCJarrettMEEtAlRelation-7890E56E)

### Dietary Interventions

Patients with IBS often report worsening of symptoms after the ingestion of certain food components. Indeed, more than 60% of patients with IBS relate the occurrence of bloating and abdominal pain to the ingestion of certain foods, such as wheat and fermentable carbohydrates.​[[17]](#VoltaUPinto-SanchezMIBoschettiEEtAl-7891031A)

- *Low FODMAP diet:* There are multiple studies and systematic reviews evaluating the effect of a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS.​[[18]](#MoayyediPQuigleyEMLacyBEEtAl.TheEff-78911AA7)​[[19]](#RaoSSYuSFedewaA.SystematicReviewDie-78911C65)​[[20]](#MarshAEslickEMEslickGD.DoesADietLow-789128D1)​[[21]](#SchumannDKlosePLaucheREtAl.LowFerme-78914156)​[[22]](#refitem-1202123-824DFE3D)​[[23]](#VarjxfaPFarkasNHegyiPEtAl.LowFermen-78914A98)​[[24]](#SinghRSalemANanavatiJEtAl.TheRoleOf-7891560D)​[[25]](#HalmosEPPowerVAShepherdSJEtAl.ADiet-78936217)​[[26]](#ZahediMJBehrouzVAzimiM.LowFermentab-78936D95) These carbohydrates can be fermented by colonic bacteria and contribute to GI symptoms. Many reviews show that a low FODMAP diet is effective in relieving IBS symptoms; however, this assumption should be taken with caution as the studies are highly different in their methodology and design, which may influence the results. A low FODMAP diet is recommended to reduce IBS symptoms but the quality of evidence is very low.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- *Gluten-free diet (GFD):* The prevalence of celiac disease is increased in IBS patients compared with the general population;​[[29]](#FordACCheyWDTalleyNJEtAl.YieldOfDia-789169A7) therefore, testing to rule out celiac disease should be considered in IBS patients. Interventional studies on gluten withdrawal suggest that there is a population of IBS patients (in whom celiac disease and wheat allergy was excluded) who may benefit from a GFD;​[[28]](#CamilleriMFordAC.IrritableBowelSynd-789161A4) however, the quality of evidence is low. A GFD is not recommended in the absence of celiac disease.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- *Elimination diet:* Some studies have suggested that an elimination diet based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food could improve symptoms in IBS patients;​[[30]](#Atkinson2004) however, the clinical evidence supporting an elimination diet in IBS is very low quality and it is not currently recommended.
- *Fibre supplementation:* There have been several studies evaluating different fibre supplements in relieving IBS symptoms. A 2014 systematic review found a modest benefit of soluble fibre (e.g., psyllium), but not insoluble fibre (e.g., wheat bran) in relieving IBS symptoms.​[[31]](#MoayyediPQuigleyEMLacyBEEtAl.TheEff-78917BCA) Current recommendations suggest use of soluble fibre, particularly psyllium, as first-line therapy.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) Fibre should be started at a nominal dose and gradually titrated upward during several weeks to a total daily intake of 20–30 g.​[[1]](#CheyWDKurlanderJEswaranS.IrritableB-788FA925)

### Modification of Gut Microflora

- *Prebiotics* refer to food components that remain undigested, such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or inulin, which stimulate either the growth or the activity of intestinal bacteria that improve host health.​[[32]](#NivEHalakATiommnyEEtAl.RandomizedCl-7892CC34) There is not much evidence for the effect of prebiotics in IBS, except for 1 trial involving guar gum, which improved IBS symptoms including bloating and excess gas.​[[32]](#NivEHalakATiommnyEEtAl.RandomizedCl-7892CC34)
- *Probiotics* are live or attenuated microorganisms that may affect the composition or function of the gut microbiota and may have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties;​[[31]](#MoayyediPQuigleyEMLacyBEEtAl.TheEff-78917BCA) they are recommended to improve IBS symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials showed that probiotics are effective treatments for IBS.​[[33]](#FordACQuigleyEMLacyBEEtAl.EfficacyO-7892E1C6)​[[34]](#CorbittMCampagnoloNStainesDEtAl.ASy-7892EB77) A 2017 review provided international consensus to support the use of probiotics to reduce overall symptoms and abdominal pain. While there is little to no evidence to suggest probiotics reduce symptoms of constipation, gas or diarrhea, there is a moderate amount of evidence to promote their use to reduce bloating/distention and to improve bowel habits, i.e., frequency and consistency.​[[35]](#HunginAPSMitchellCRWhorwellPEtAl.Sy-7892FB18) A recent pilot study showed that the probiotic strain *Bifidobacterium longum* can improve concomitant depression in IBS patients.​[[36]](#Pinto-SanchezMIHallGBGhajarKetAl.Pr-78931E44) Further information is required to determine the optimal dosage and duration, as well as which individual species, preparation or strain is the most beneficial to relieve the overall IBS symptom burden.​[[35]](#HunginAPSMitchellCRWhorwellPEtAl.Sy-7892FB18)
- *Fecal microbiota transplantation:* Some reports on IBS patients receiving fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) suggest that FMT may improve dysbiosis and reduce IBS symptoms in a proportion of patients.​[[37]](#El-SalhyMMazzawiT.FecalMicrobiotaTr-78932033) Although the treatment seems to be a promising tool for IBS management, there is a need for more controlled studies before any recommendation can be made.

### Psychological Treatment

Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnosis and mindfulness-based therapies have been designed and implemented effectively in IBS.​[[38]](#BallouSKeeferL.PsychologicalInterve-78932234) Both CBT and hypnotherapy are recommended to improve IBS symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) Although it is not often incorporated into routine practice, CBT is the most widely studied psychotherapy. A prospective study comparing standard CBT with home-based CBT demonstrated that minimal-contact CBT combined with self-guided therapy provided greater improvement in GI symptoms at 2 weeks and over the 12 month follow-up period.​[[39]](#refitem-1242138-8DA444A3)

### Pharmacologic Choices

If nonpharmacologic interventions fail to control IBS symptoms, pharmacologic therapies should be initiated based upon IBS subtype and predominant symptoms. Ideally, therapies of choice would have been evaluated in high-quality randomized controlled trials. Unfortunately, the evidence supporting the use of many available treatments for IBS is poor and long-term data is lacking.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) For pharmacologic treatment options see [Table 4](#c0049n00015).

### IBS-Constipation Predominant

- Water-soluble fibre (e.g., psyllium, **calcium polycarbophil**) is a first-line management strategy for IBS-C to increase stool frequency.​[[42]](#refitem-1242139-8DA77F3C)
- Osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol) may increase the frequency of bowel movements and improve consistency. Polyethylene glycol is not recommended to improve overall IBS symptoms; however, it may be beneficial as adjunctive therapy if pain has improved but constipation persists.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- Agents that target multiple symptoms in IBS-C include lubiprostone, linaclotide and plecanatide. Lubiprostone is a prostaglandin derivative and selective chloride channel activator, which facilitates transport of chloride, sodium and water into the intestinal lumen.​[[43]](#KhanSChangL.DiagnosisAndManagementO-78934279) It has been shown to provide significant relief from IBS-C symptoms including bloating and bowel frequency and consistency. While recommended to improve IBS symptoms,​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) lubiprostone is not available in Canada. Linaclotide binds to guanylate cyclase C (GCC) receptors in a pH-independent manner and can be active throughout the small intestine and colon to stimulate fluid secretion, increase colonic transit and modulate pain. Linaclotide is recommended to improve overall IBS symptoms in patients with IBS-C.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) Plecanatide binds to GCC receptors in a pH-dependent manner, confining most activity to the proximal small intestine. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analyses found linaclotide and plecanatide demonstrated similar efficacy and tolerability in treating IBS-C.​[[44]](#ShahEDKimHMSchoenfeldP.EfficacyAndT-78932FEA)
- For patients with IBS-C and predominant pain, antispasmodics (dicyclomine, hyoscine, and pinaverium) have been proposed as they relax intestinal smooth muscle.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) Although the overall quality of evidence for their use is low, they may provide short-term symptomatic relief for abdominal pain​[[42]](#refitem-1242139-8DA77F3C) and are recommended to improve IBS symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- Prucalopride, a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist, is classified as a prokinetic agent and is an alternative option to treat constipation. Although prucalopride was shown to be effective in idiopathic constipation, there is less evidence for the efficacy of prucalopride in IBS-C​[[45]](#CamillieriMMcKenzieSBurtonDEtAl.Pru-789358CC) and it is not recommended to improve overall IBS symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) As with the osmotic laxatives, prucalopride may be considered to specifically treat constipation.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)

### IBS-Diarrhea Predominant

- Water-soluble fibre (e.g., psyllium) has a high water-holding/gel-forming capacity and acts as a bulking agent.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28)

  It may also have a positive effect on the gut microbiome. Psyllium is recommended to improve IBS-D symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- Loperamide and diphenoxylate-atropine, mu-opioid receptor agonist products, decrease diarrhea by slowing intestinal transit and reducing the secretion of fluids into the intestinal lumen.​[[46]](#EnckPAzizQBarbaraGEtAl.IrritableBow-78939A26) Loperamide can be used prophylactically when patients anticipate diarrhea​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) but it is not recommended for continuous use to treat IBS-D.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019) Diphenoxylate-atropine sulfate may be used for symptomatic treatment of diarrhea but caution should be exercised in elderly patients and in patients taking other medications with anticholinergic side effects.
- Eluxadoline is a therapeutic agent with mixed opioid effects (mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonist and delta-opioid receptor antagonist). In a 2016 study, eluxadoline reduced symptoms of IBS with diarrhea, with sustained efficacy over 6 months in patients who received the 100 mg dose twice daily.​[[47]](#LemboAJLacyBEZuckermanMJEtAl.Eluxad-789398C9) Eluxadoline is conditionally recommended to improve IBS symptoms in patients with IBS-D.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- Cholestyramine may be an effective option based on the premise that one-quarter of patients who meet the criteria for IBS-D have bile acid malabsorption; ​[[48]](#SlatterySANiazOAzizQEtAl.Systematic-789396AB) however, the effect in patients without comorbid bile acid malabsorption has not been evaluated.​[[1]](#CheyWDKurlanderJEswaranS.IrritableB-788FA925) Cholestyramine is not recommended to improve IBS symptoms.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)
- Ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) has been shown to decrease mild to moderate diarrhea, but it does not improve severe diarrhea based on limited data.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28)
- Rifaximin is an antibiotic with low systemic absorption that targets the gut. The mechanism of action in IBS is unknown but may involve the gut micorbiome. Available evidence suggests rifaximin provides relief of IBS symptoms in patients with IBS-D compared with placebo;​[[49]](#PimentelMLemboACheyWDEtAlTARGETStud-7893BCEE) however, concerns regarding potential for antibiotic resistance and cost prevent a recommendation for or against use in IBS-D.​[[27]](#CAGGuidelines2019)

### IBS-Mixed Pattern

- Treatment should be adjusted according to the predominant symptom of diarrhea or constipation.
- Patients experiencing “pseudo IBS-M” (overflow diarrhea after constipation) require treatment targeting constipation.
- Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; e.g., amitriptyline, desipramine and imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., citalopram fluoxetine and paroxetine) are recommended to improve IBS symptoms. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, antidepressants improved abdominal pain and IBS symptoms.​[[50]](#FordACQuigleyEMLacyBEEtAl.EffectOfA-78934F0C) TCAs are associated with increased colonic transit time and may be more effective for IBS-D.​[[51]](#refitem-1202138-80D4DADB) SSRIs have a prokinetic effect and may be more effective for IBS-C.​[[12]](#MoayyediPMearinFAzpirozFEtAl.Irrita-7890BA28) TCAs are used at lower dosages to treat IBS than depression; SSRIs are used at the same dosage for IBS and depression.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

IBS and pregnancy are independent; there is no evidence that one affects the other. A prominent feature of IBS is its unpredictable, chronic and relapsing nature. Therefore, in a patient with IBS, pregnancy may be accompanied with worsened, improved or unchanged IBS symptoms. IBS is not a contraindication for pregnancy, nor are there any specific precautions to consider prior to pregnancy. Management of IBS during pregnancy or breastfeeding entails addressing the symptoms when necessary. In principle, no drug should be used unless absolutely necessary and then only after all nondrug therapies have been tried.

For the treatment of IBS-C during pregnancy, encourage nonpharmacologic treatments such as adequate hydration, physical activity and increased dietary fibre. Because they are not systemically absorbed, bulk-forming agents such as psyllium are considered first-line in pregnancy while stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl may be recommended for short-term use; all are compatible with breastfeeding.​[[52]](#refitem-1202145-80CAB087)​[[53]](#refitem-1202147-80CCEEFB) Dicyclomine has been used safely during pregnancy but studies evaluating use during breastfeeding are lacking.​[[54]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKTowersCVEds.DrugsI-91C1AFA5) The use of pinaverium, linaclotide or prucalopride during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended based on insufficient human safety data.​[[54]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKTowersCVEds.DrugsI-91C1AFA5)​[[55]](#refitem-1242155-91C3ED20)​[[56]](#refitem-1242156-91C3EEB1)​[[57]](#refitem-1242157-91C3F0CD)

For the treatment of IBS-D during pregnancy, psyllium and **calcium polycarbophil** are unabsorbed and are safe and compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding. Colesevelam may be used for diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption during pregnancy when benefits exceed risks; supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins is recommended due to reduced absorption.​[[58]](#refitem-1242152-91C0A3A4) Although loperamide has not been associated with teratogenic effects, safe use during pregnancy has not been established. Small amounts of loperamide are transferred into breast milk but are unlikely to affect the breastfeeding infant.​[[52]](#refitem-1202145-80CAB087) **Diphenoxylate with atropine** should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding since it has been found to be teratogenic in animals and its active metabolite is probably transferred to breast milk.​[[59]](#refitem-1202146-80CBA7E1) There is insufficient safety data evaluating the use of eluxadoline and rifaximin during pregnancy and lactation.​[[54]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKTowersCVEds.DrugsI-91C1AFA5)​[[60]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabaseOnl-91C38D4E)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Encourage all patients to eat a healthy diet (e.g., regular meal pattern and limited fat, caffeine, alcohol) and engage in regular physical activity. If the patient wishes to follow a particular diet (e.g., low FODMAP, gluten-free or elimination), a dietitian should be involved for meal suggestions and to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
- Optimize the treatment strategy depending on patient's predominant symptoms or subtype and on personal preferences; reserve pharmacologic treatment options for patients who do not respond to initial therapies.

### Drug Table

**Table 4:** Drugs Used for the Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antibacterials**

| rifaximin Zaxine $25 | For diarrhea, pain: 550 mg TID PO × 14 d | Diarrhea, nausea. | Cyclosporine increases rifamixin levels via P-glycoprotein inhibition; monitor for rifaximin adverse effects. Rifaximin may alter effectiveness of sodium picosulfate–containing bowel preparations; use alternate product. Warfarin may be less effective; monitor INR. | Minimal systemic absorption; acts locally to alter the microflora of the gut. May be repeated for up to 3 treatment courses.​ [40] |

**Drug Class: Antidiarrheals**

| diphenoxylate /​ atropine sulfate Lomotil $2–4 | For diarrhea: 5 mg (diphenoxylate) PO initially then 2.5 mg PO after each loose bowel movement (maximum 20 mg/day ) | Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps, dry skin and mucous membranes (from atropine), some addiction potential. | Additive anticholinergic effects with other anticholinergic agents. | The elderly are more susceptible to the antimuscarinic effects of atropine, e.g., agitation, drowsiness, increased intraocular pressure. |
| loperamide Imodium , generics <$1–2 | For diarrhea: 4 mg PO after 1​ st loose stool then 2 mg PO after each subsequent stool (maximum of 16 mg/day ) | Sedation, dizziness, nausea, abdominal cramps. Lowest addiction potential of all opioids. |  | Reports of loperamide being abused as an opioid substitute; higher than recommended doses can lead to cardiac dysrhythmia and death.​ [41] |
