### Pathophysiology

Enterobiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the nematode Enterobius vermicularis (commonly referred to as pinworm, seatworm, roundworm or threadworm). Although the adult worms resemble white cotton threads about 1 cm in length, the name threadworm is best reserved for Strongyloides stercoralis.

Humans are the only natural host of E. vermicularis. Cats and dogs have been shown to hold eggs on their fur, probably as a result of dust contamination (e.g., shaking bedclothes in their presence) but there is no evidence they can act as carriers of the infection.​[[1]](#psc1039n1002)​[[2]](#psc1039n1003)

Transmission of E. vermicularis is human-to-human via the fecal-oral route; mature eggs are transferred from the anus to the mouth and ingested. The larvae hatch in the small intestine and the adults establish themselves in the colon. The time interval of this cycle is about 1 month and the life span of the adults is about 2 months. Mature females migrate to the anus at night and lay eggs on the perianal or perineal skin. The larvae inside the eggs develop and the eggs become infective in 4–6 hours.​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434) These eggs are transferred from the perianal region to hands, clothing, bedding and other surfaces; they can even become airborne and ingested while breathing. The eggs remain infective for up to 20 days.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004) The most common mode of fecal-oral transmission is on hands and under fingernails, either through scratching or handling infected clothes and linens.​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434)​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)​[[5]](#psc1039n1005)​[[6]](#psc1039n1001)

Pinworm infection is particularly common in school children 5–14 years of age and uncommon in children younger than 2 years.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)​[[5]](#psc1039n1005) It is estimated that up to one-third of children globally will be infested during their childhood.​[[7]](#refitem-119217-7573C18C) It is the most common intestinal parasite seen in the primary care setting, regardless of socioeconomic circumstances.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)​[[8]](#psc1039n1006)

Enterobiasis is more prevalent in temperate and cold climates because of less frequent bathing and infrequent changing of underclothing.​[[2]](#psc1039n1003) It is facilitated by factors such as overcrowding in schools and family groupings as well as inadequate personal and community hygiene. Pinworms are more common within families with school-aged children, in primary caregivers of infected children and with institutionalized patients.

Despite the high prevalence of pinworms, it is a rather innocuous parasite. The usual consequences of infection include loss of sleep, discomfort due to anal itching and embarrassment due to the social connotations of having “worms.” Often an entire family is affected. Secondary bacterial infections can occur as complications, e.g., due to excessive scratching. Only rarely have pinworm infections been associated with significant pathology, including vulvovaginitis, dysuria, enuresis, urinary tract infection, appendicitis, chronic salpingitis, and ulcerative lesions of the small and large intestine.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)

### Goals of Therapy

- Eliminate the infection
- Relieve symptoms such as itchiness
- Promote good hygiene
- Prevent transmission, reinfection and complications

### Patient Assessment

Though most infections are asymptomatic, enterobiasis is often associated with perianal or perineal itching, particularly if there is a high worm burden.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)​[[7]](#refitem-119217-7573C18C) The itching is worse at night, when the females lay eggs that are attached to the perianal area by a sticky substance that causes pruritus. The itching may contribute to insomnia and restlessness.​[[2]](#psc1039n1003) Although symptoms may alert the patient to a potential problem, studies have shown no difference in the incidence of “classic” symptoms between infected and noninfected children;​[[4]](#psc1039n1004) this reinforces the need for actual viewing of the pinworm or its ova for definite diagnosis​[[6]](#psc1039n1001) (see [Diagnosis of Pinworm](#psc1039n00004)).

Conditions such as diaper dermatitis, constipation, psoriasis of the anogenital region, and perianal eczema may mimic symptoms of pinworms and should be considered and ruled out in patients presenting with perianal itching before recommending treatment.

Scratching may cause skin irritation. If severe scratching occurs, the skin may break down and allow development of a secondary bacterial infection, eczematous dermatitis or bleeding.​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434) If the worm migrates to the genital area in females, vulvovaginitis, vaginal discharge and irritation may be seen.​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434) Enuresis has also been attributed to pinworms.​[[2]](#psc1039n1003)

While extensive pinworm infection may cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, these symptoms are not typical of uncomplicated infection. If the patient presents with abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, bloody bowel movements, dysuria, fever, extreme poor appetite, neurotic excoriation (self-inflicted lesions produced by repetitive scratching) or anogenital symptoms associated with sexual abuse,​[[9]](#refitem-119218-757BE0C2) further assessment and medical attention are required.

A health-care practitioner should be consulted to confirm the diagnosis of a suspected pinworm infestation (see [Diagnosis of Pinworm](#psc1039n00004)). This is especially important for pregnant patients, children under 12, and those with renal or hepatic impairment.

### Diagnosis of Pinworm

Pinworm diagnosis is best confirmed on visual identification of either the ova or the worm itself.​[[4]](#psc1039n1004)​[[6]](#psc1039n1001)​[[8]](#psc1039n1006) Since eggs are only seen on occasion in the stool, stool sample is not a reliable method of diagnosis. The 3 most common diagnostic methods are:

- Flashlight test:​[[6]](#psc1039n1001) parents may directly observe the worms during ovipositing by putting the child to bed without underpants and using a flashlight to examine the anus after the child has been sleeping for 2–3 hours. Worms obtained by the parents should be placed in alcohol or vinegar and brought to the clinic for confirmation of the diagnosis.
- Scotch-tape test (cellulose-tape slide test):​[[6]](#psc1039n1001) this test is performed at home in the morning before defecation or washing. A piece of transparent adhesive tape is pressed on the perianal skin, then stuck to a slide to be examined under a microscope. Alternatively, a supply pack or “paddle test” for 1 pinworm ova analysis containing 1 vial with a sticky paddle on the screw cap may be obtained from a physician or health-care provider’s office. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of pinworm ova. The test may be repeated several times (e.g., on 3 consecutive mornings) to improve detection rates. A single examination will confirm the diagnosis in 50%, 3 exams in 90% and 5 exams in 99% of cases.
- Microscopic analysis of subungual samples:​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434) ova may be found under the fingernails of infected patients, since anal itching is a common symptom of pinworm infection.

### Prevention

Prevention is difficult. However, proper hygiene is helpful and includes careful handwashing after using the toilet, after scratching the perianal area, and before and after eating or preparing food.​[[1]](#psc1039n1002)​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434)​[[7]](#refitem-119217-7573C18C)

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

As with prevention, proper hygiene is an important component of nonpharmacologic management of pinworm infestations. If ingestion of eggs and subsequent reinfection can be avoided, the infection can be self-limiting and eradicate within 4–8 weeks​[[10]](#StatPearls2021)​[[11]](#Mansons2014) (the life cycle of pinworms). In practice, however, this is difficult to achieve and reinfection and ongoing infestation is common; pharmacologic therapy is usually necessary for eradication.

Nonpharmacologic measures should always be used as adjunctive therapy in combination with any drug treatment.​[[3]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-FE858434)​[[6]](#psc1039n1001)​[[7]](#refitem-119217-7573C18C) These include:

- Showering each morning (showering is preferred over bathing to avoid possible contamination of bathwater)
- Avoiding co-bathing and reusing or sharing washcloths during treatment time and for 2 weeks after final treatment
- Handwashing and fingernail cleaning, especially prior to meals and after using the bathroom or scratching the perianal area
- Keeping fingernails short and clean
- Avoiding nail biting or placing fingers in the mouth
- Discouraging children from thumb-sucking, placing hands in mouth or sucking on toys
- Encouraging all family members to wear cotton underpants that have been washed in hot, soapy water; these should be worn day and night and changed twice daily for the week following treatment
- Washing nightclothes, underwear and hand towels daily for 2 weeks
- Cleaning bedding/sheets regularly (every 3–7 days for 3 weeks) and at the start of each treatment course
- Avoiding shaking linens or clothing prior to washing
- Cleaning the floors of sleeping areas as thoroughly as possible with household cleaner and water or by vacuuming around beds, curtains and other articles in the bedroom where the highest concentrations of eggs are likely to occur
- Washing the toilet seat daily

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Anthelmintic Products.

A confirmed diagnosis by an appropriate health-care practitioner is recommended before pharmacologic treatment is initiated to minimize unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects of the anthelmintics. Pinworm infections respond readily to drug therapy, but reinfection is common.​[[8]](#psc1039n1006) Treatment failure is usually due to reinfection.

Treatment with the anthelmintics mebendazole (prescription only) or pyrantel pamoate (nonprescription) results in a high cure rate with minimal side effects (see [Table 2](#d2e585)).​[[5]](#psc1039n1005) Albendazole is also an effective treatment, but is available only through Health Canada’s Special Access Program (SAP). Since these anthelmintics do not reliably kill pinworm eggs, it is prudent to repeat treatment 2 weeks later to eliminate possible reinfection.​[[1]](#psc1039n1002)​[[12]](#psc1039n1015) Since reinfection occurs easily, prevention (e.g., handwashing) should always be discussed at the time of treatment. Since pinworms can be passed from one person to another, some experts suggest treating all close contacts of a person with pinworms even if they are asymptomatic to prevent reinfection and spread of pinworms. This is especially important in households where more than one member is infected or where repeated, symptomatic infections occur. The use of laxatives to facilitate removal of pinworms after anthelmintic therapy is not necessary.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Patients who are pregnant should not self-treat and should consult their health-care provider. There is limited data on the use of the available anthelmintics in pregnancy. An asymptomatic pregnant patient with pinworms should be treated after delivery since there are no harmful effects to patient or fetus from the pinworm infection. If the patient is experiencing symptoms that may negatively affect the pregnancy, e.g., weight loss or sleeplessness, treatment may be considered, preferably in the third trimester.​[[13]](#CDC)

Mebendazole should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy; while there is very limited data suggesting no major teratogenic risk, it is insufficient to support use in the first trimester.​[[14]](#Schaefer2015) Mebendazole is considered compatible in the second and third trimesters.​[[14]](#Schaefer2015)​[[15]](#refitem-1192111-757EEEAA)​[[16]](#Gyorkos2019) There is insufficient information regarding the use of pyrantel pamoate during pregnancy to assess risk; therefore, use should be avoided in favour of alternative therapies with available pregnancy safety data.​[[14]](#Schaefer2015)​[[15]](#refitem-1192111-757EEEAA) The WHO recognizes that the effect of pyrantel pamoate on birth outcomes is unknown but supports its use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in circumstances where the benefit outweighs the risk.​[[13]](#CDC) While teratogenic effects were observed in animal reproduction studies, there are reports suggesting albendazole is not a major human teratogen.​[[16]](#Gyorkos2019)​[[17]](#Choi2017) Limited evidence has not shown a major risk in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there are records of use in the second or third trimesters of several thousand pregnancies with no reported adverse effects to the fetus.​[[14]](#Schaefer2015) The WHO allows use of albendazole in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.​[[18]](#WHOPregnancy2016)

Mebendazole is poorly absorbed, with <10% of an oral dose reaching systemic circulation; the amount transferred into breast milk is clinically insignificant and there have been no reports of adverse reactions in breastfeeding. Although pyrantel pamoate has limited information in breastfeeding, it is also poorly absorbed orally. At the usual dose, mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate are considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[[15]](#refitem-1192111-757EEEAA)​[[19]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed39780-FE8AC9E4)​[[20]](#refitem-1162147-45A78DC5) Albendazole and its active metabolite are minimally transferred into breast milk and are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, there is minimal risk to the infant from a single oral dose for pinworm treatment. An informal consultation group to the WHO concluded that a single oral dose of albendazole can be given to lactating patients.​[[21]](#LactMed)​[[22]](#Allen2002)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 1](#psc1039n00011) provides a monitoring plan framework, which should be individualized.

**Table 1:** Monitoring of Therapy for Pinworms

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perianal itching | Parent/patient: daily Health-care practitioner: day 7 | Resolution of itching | If itching has not resolved within 7–14 days of starting medication, repeat treatment. If itching has not resolved within 7 days of beginning second course, or if signs of bacterial superinfection occur, refer to an appropriate health-care practitioner for further assessment. |
| Adverse effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps | Parent/patient: daily Health-care practitioner: day 1 after treatment | Minimal gastrointestinal effects | If adverse GI effects interfere with functioning or persist for more than 3 days after treatment ends, consult with an appropriate health-care practitioner. |
| Adverse effects: dizziness, drowsiness | Parent/patient: daily Health-care practitioner: day 1 after treatment | Minimal drowsiness or dizziness | Caution patient not to drive or use hazardous machinery until effect of drug is known. If symptoms interfere with function or persist more than 24 h after treatment, consult with an appropriate health-care practitioner. |

### Advice for the Patient

Advise patient regarding:

- Proper use of the drug, expected results, management of side effects and need for any repeat doses
- The need to treat household members at the same time (unless there is a contraindication)
- Adjunctive nonpharmacologic measures and proper hygiene
- The mostly innocuous nature of a pinworm infection
- Visiting a health-care practitioner if symptoms continue or recur, or if adverse effects occur

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad506979e707) There is limited data on the use of the available anthelmintics in pregnancy. An asymptomatic pregnant patient with pinworms should be treated after delivery since there are no harmful effects to patient or fetus from the pinworm infection. If the patient is experiencing symptoms that may negatively affect the pregnancy, e.g., weight loss or sleeplessness, treatment may be considered, preferably in the third trimester.
