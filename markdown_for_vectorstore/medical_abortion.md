### Introduction

Globally, an estimated 40% of all pregnancies are unplanned.​[[1]](#refitem-114211-3830E351) Unintended pregnancies are associated with increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, delayed prenatal care, decreased rates and duration of breastfeeding, reduced physical health, lower education status, and childhood behavioural problems. Other negative associations include poor maternal mental health (depression, stress, decreased life satisfaction) and a lower-quality mother-child relationship.​[[1]](#refitem-114211-3830E351)​[[2]](#refitem-114212-383B3E6A)​[[3]](#refitem-114213-383F11D7) Effective birth-control does not preclude the requirement for abortion services, as 36.5% of women in a large study became pregnant while using contraception.​[[4]](#refitem-1162149-458C2303)​[[5]](#refitem-1162151-459A43BE) In Canada, the rate of unintended pregnancy ranges from 34–40% and, according to a 2016 survey, up to 61%.​[[6]](#refitem-114214-38403510) While the rate of abortion in Canada is not well captured, globally 50% of unplanned pregnancies end in abortion.​[[1]](#refitem-114211-3830E351)​[[6]](#refitem-114214-38403510)

Induced abortion, which includes the termination of pregnancy by surgical means or through the use of 1 or more medications, has been decriminalized in Canada since 1969. An estimated 31% of Canadian individuals able to become pregnant have had at least 1 abortion in their reproductive lifespan.​[[7]](#refitem-114216-38468DA2)​[[8]](#refitem-114217-38A61D9A) The majority of abortions in Canada have been surgical; medical abortion (MA), which involves the use of medications to terminate a pregnancy, has been relatively rare at 4%.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)​[[10]](#refitem-114218-38AA9C18) In countries with a history of performing MA with the abortifacient mifepristone, the abortion rates do not rise; the proportion of abortions that are medical increase and surgical abortions decrease, in part due to increased access for patients living in remote areas.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862) In Canada, disparities exist between regions and/or provinces for access to abortion services.​[[10]](#refitem-114218-38AA9C18) The approval of the mifepristone/misoprostol regimen by Health Canada in 2015 allowed equitable access to safe abortion services for Canadian patients. While misoprostol and mifepristone can be used in the management of incomplete abortion and intrauterine fetal demise,​[[11]](#WHO2022) this chapter discusses pharmacological regimens used for induction of abortion.

### Goals of Therapy

- Safely terminate a first-trimester pregnancy
- Prevent and manage any adverse effects or potential complications
- Initiate an effective contraceptive plan post-abortion

### Investigations

A pregnant patient considering an abortion requires timely pre-abortion care including counselling and prompt investigation to exclude any contraindications (see [Table 1](#contraindications)) and to determine the duration and location of the pregnancy. Prior to a MA, the prescribing clinician should:

- Confirm and/or establish pregnancy and gestational age (GA):

  - confirmation can be done with an office-based beta-hCG urine test. Where direct access to a clinic or a medical provider is difficult (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic), patient may provide date of positive pregnancy test
  - the last menstrual period (LMP) may be used to determine GA in patients with regular cycles who can recall with certainty their LMP.​[[12]](#Schonberg2014) In patients with irregular cycles, LMP in addition to physical examination (see below) may accurately determine GA
- Obtain medical history to determine ideal post-abortion contraceptive choice (see Contraception) and to assess for the need for an ultrasound and/or laboratory investigations ([see ultrasound](#Ultrasoundlist) and [laboratory investigations):](#Labtesting)

  - contraindications to hormonal contraceptives
  - obstetric and gynecologic history including recent history of bleeding or pelvic pain
  - current medication list, including form of birth control, if any
  - history or presence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
  - personal and family history of diseases, e.g., bleeding tendencies or coagulation disorders; steroid-dependent asthma
  - psychosocial history
  - allergies
  - presence of intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
- Consider the following physical examination:

  - baseline vitals, e.g., pulse, BP, temperature
  - height and weight for dosing of methotrexate
  - bimanual pelvic, abdominal exam and visual examination:

    - signs on exam such as softening of the cervical isthmus and softening and enlargement of the uterus can be seen as early as 6–8 weeks into pregnancy
    - the estimated uterus size, when assessed in conjunction with the LMP, can indicate if further evaluation is required. For example, a larger than expected uterus based on LMP may indicate multiple pregnancy, uterine fibroids, uterine tumor or molar pregnancy (abnormal intrauterine mass). A smaller than expected uterus may be due to an ectopic pregnancy; an ultrasound in such cases is required (see [Ectopic Pregnancy](#n02037))
    - signs or symptoms of STIs, e.g., rash, lesions, discharge and/or lymphadenopathy
- Conduct laboratory testing:

  - hemoglobin levels to rule out anemia
  - rhesus (Rh) blood group typing. Fetal red blood cells can start expressing Rh antigen at 52 days from LMP; Rh alloimmunization can occur and jeopardize future pregnancies in Rh-negative patients. Routine testing and administration of immune globulin is advised beyond 49 days from LMP and may be considered before 49 days​[[13]](#Costescu2016)
  - baseline serum beta-hCG; levels rise linearly in the first 6 weeks of pregnancy then are variable. When used alone, they cannot reliably date a pregnancy but when used in conjunction with ultrasound, serial serum beta-hCG levels can assist in dating or confirming completion of an abortion. Beta-hGC levels may also be used post-abortion to confirm successful abortion
  - urine or cervicovaginal swabs for STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea
- Perform an ultrasound:

  - gold standard for confirming the pregnancy duration/location
  - required prior to medical abortion if risk factors or signs/symptoms of ectopic pregnancy
  - routine use of ultrasound prior to abortion is not mandatory according to the Society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians of Canada (SOGC) guidelines.​[[11]](#WHO2022)​[[13]](#Costescu2016) In April 2019, Health Canada removed the requirement for mandatory ultrasound prior to administration of MA​[[14]](#HC2019)

### Ectopic Pregnancy

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs at a rate of 1–2% in the general population and 0.5% in patients presenting for an abortion.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) When untreated, it is a potentially life-threatening event. An ultrasound should be performed in all patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy as medical abortion, particularly the use of mifepristone and misoprostol, is contraindicated in these patients. Clinical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, dizziness and pallor. Patients with risk factors for EP include:

- Previous EP
- Tubal surgery or ligation
- Pelvic inflammatory disease or history of salpingitis
- Assisted reproductive techniques used to conceive
- Pregnancy with IUD in place

For a patient with a positive pregnancy test, a gestational sac can usually be visualized by a transvaginal ultrasound by Day 32–33, a yolk sac by Day 35–42 and a fetal pole by Day 40–49 from LMP. An extrauterine gestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo is diagnostic of EP. If a patient has a positive pregnancy test but no intrauterine gestational sac can be visualized, they are classified as having a *pregnancy of unknown location* (PUL). Although the presence of an empty uterus, adnexal mass and pseudogestational sac, i.e., a collection of fluid in the endometrial cavity, may indicate an EP, it is not a sensitive indicator and should be treated as a PUL.​[[15]](#refitem-1192115-55059AC1) The presence of risk factors or clinical symptoms of EP, serum beta-hCG levels, and the location of the gestational sac seen on ultrasound are used to determine if a MA is an appropriate procedure for a PUL. It is suggested to use the following approach:​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

- If an intrauterine gestational sac is absent with either risk factors/clinical symptoms of EP or a beta-hCG level >2000 units/L, further investigations are required.
- If the gestational sac cannot be visualized in the intrauterine or extrauterine space, it may be reasonable to proceed with MA when there are no risk factors/clinical symptoms of EP and the beta-hCG level ≤2000 units/L.
- If a gestational sac is visualized but a yolk sac or fetal pole is not present and there are no risk factors/clinical symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, it may be reasonable to proceed with a MA with adequate counselling, including warning signs of EP, and follow-up.

Note that in situations where a patient is certain of the LMP and an ultrasound is not performed, the pregnancy is considered to be a PUL.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) See [Table 1](#contraindications) for contraindications and [Figure 1](#medicalabortion) for the suggested management of a MA.

**Table 1:** Contraindications for Medical Abortion​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

| Medical Abortion Regimen | Condition | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All medical abortion regimens | Confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy | Extrauterine pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening event. Mifepristone/misoprostol is not an appropriate treatment option and can delay diagnosis due to similar symptoms/adverse effects. Refer for appropriate management. |
| IUD in place | Risk factor for ectopic pregnancy if, in the rare case, pregnancy occurs while IUD in place. Extrauterine pregnancy must be excluded by ultrasound. IUD must be removed, if possible, prior to MA. |
| Hemorrhagic disorders or using anticoagulants | Relative contraindication. MA is associated with more bleeding than surgical abortion and is unsupervised. Blood loss can be monitored in a controlled fashion with surgical abortions; consider surgical over MA in patients at risk of bleeding.​ [16] |
| Anemia (Hg <95g/L) | Threshold for Hg level unclear.​ [16] Studies of medical abortion exclude anemic women (Hg <100g/L) . Exercise caution for patients who are anemic. |
| Known hypersensitivity to drug or excipients | Avoid use of medications with prior allergic/hypersensitivity reaction due to risk of anaphylaxis. |
| Ambivalence | Decisions regarding pregnancy should be certain; abortion is irreversible. |
| Mifepristone/misoprostol | Chronic adrenal failure | Mifepristone is a corticosteroid receptor antagonist and can therefore exacerbate the adrenal insufficiency in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy.​ [17] |
| Inherited porphyria | Mifepristone could exacerbate the manifestation of porphyria.​ [17] |
| Uncontrolled asthma | Relative contraindication. Mifepristone is a corticosteroid receptor antagonist and can therefore exacerbate asthma in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy.​ [17] |
| Inflammatory bowel disease | Relative contraindication. Misoprostol may exacerbate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. |
| Methotrexate/misoprostol | Active liver disease | Methotrexate use is associated with a risk of increased liver enzymes. |
| Active renal disease | Increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. |
| Inflammatory bowel disease | Relative contraindication. Misoprostol may exacerbate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

An essential component of abortion services is providing timely information as well as confidential counselling to patients in a nondirect and nonjudgmental communication style. Although a discussion regarding pregnancy options, including carrying the baby to term, placing the infant for adoption or having an abortion, may occur, many patients have already made a firm decision. An assessment of emotional needs, values and coping skills can assist in determining if a supportive person should be present during the procedure and if further referral is warranted. While some patients may have firmly decided to have an abortion, some degree of ambivalence is common. Some patients may prefer to discuss all options, including the different methods used for abortion, prior to making a decision.

In addition to the use of medications, the termination of a pregnancy may occur through surgery. Vacuum aspiration, either manual or electric, is the recommended technique of surgery for a first-trimester abortion.​[[11]](#WHO2022) Both medical and surgical methods are available to terminate a pregnancy at 5 weeks after LMP. Each method of terminating a pregnancy has advantages and disadvantages that should be discussed with patients seeking an abortion (see [Table 2](#medicalsurgical)). Patients selecting a surgical abortion may be referred to an appropriate provider, abortion clinic or hospital.

For medical abortions, key points to address include directions for use, including optimal timing of administration, side effect management and when to seek medical attention. A follow-up appointment must be booked to ensure termination is complete and to evaluate for potential complications. It may be scheduled as early as Day 3, but most often at 7–14 days postadministration. While post-abortion contraception options should be discussed *prior* to abortion, a decision may be made at the scheduled follow-up appointment; see Contraception for further information.

**Table 2:** Medical Abortion Versus Surgical Abortion​[[6]](#refitem-114214-38403510)[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)

| Method of Abortion: | Medical | Surgical |
| Advantages | ≥95% success rate within 1–3 wk​ [a] Medications can be taken in privacy of own home Avoids surgery Anesthesia not required No need for transportation to clinic Similar to a natural miscarriage Cost of procedure varies based on region and individual drug coverage | 99% success rate Less bleeding than medical abortion; usually light Usually less painful than medical abortion, as anesthesia often given Quick completion (usually done in 5–10 min with 30–60 min observation time) Completed in 1 visit (or 2 if assessment is separate) Cost of procedure covered with provincial insurance |
| Disadvantages | May be painful Heavier bleeding than regular menses May have to pay for the medications out of pocket Requires 2–3 visits for assessment, administration of medication and follow-up (may require more, depending on type of medications used) May take days or weeks to complete, depending on medical protocol Medications may be contraindicated in certain situations, e.g., ectopic pregnancy, presence of IUD or IUS (see Table 1 ) May still require a surgical abortion in the event of ongoing pregnancy (~2%) | Surgical intervention Transportation may be required if anesthesia given Surgical services may not be available close to the community where the patient lives |

[a] Note that success rate for medical abortion varies with medication used and becomes less effective with advancing gestational age.

### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Mifepristone

Mifepristone is a potent progesterone receptor modulator with strong antiprogestogen and antiglucocorticoid activity. It elicits abortion by blocking progesterone receptors, thereby inhibiting the action of progesterone required to maintain pregnancy. Without progesterone, the endometrium degenerates, prostaglandins are produced, the uterus becomes contractile, the cervix softens and dilates, and beta-hCG levels decrease, triggering bleeding.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)

Mifepristone is most effective when used in combination with misoprostol for MA.​[[19]](#Zhang2022) A regimen of mifepristone 200 mg (oral) and misoprostol 800 mcg (buccal, vaginal or sublingual) demonstrated 94.2–99.8% efficacy in pregnancies ≤63 days.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[20]](#Raymond2014)​[[21]](#Chen2015) The mifepristone/misoprostol combination is the regimen of choice for medical abortions and the only regimen officially approved by Health Canada. It is only officially indicated for use in pregnancies ≤63 days’ gestation, but accumulating evidence suggests that it is safe and effective in the late first trimester.​[[22]](#Kapp2019) According to SOGC guidelines, it may be used up to 70 days’ gestation in eligible patients.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) See [Table 3](#regimens) for dosing regimen and [Table 4](#dt) for adverse effects.

#### Misoprostol

Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue, a potent synthetic form of prostaglandin E1 that causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, causing expulsion of the pregnancy.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862) Prior to 2015, misoprostol was approved only for prevention and treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers,​[[23]](#MisoprostolPM) but it has been used in combination with methotrexate off-label for MA in Canada. In 2015, the combination of misoprostol and mifepristone received approval for medical termination of pregnancy ≤63 days’ gestation.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)​[[19]](#Zhang2022)

Misoprostol may be used alone for MA,​[[24]](#Raymond2019)​[[25]](#Abubeker2020) but it generally requires repeated doses and is less effective than when used in combination with either mifepristone or methotrexate.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)​[[19]](#Zhang2022)

In pregnancies ≤63 days, misoprostol 800 mcg (buccal, vaginal or sublingual) achieved complete abortion rates of 78–90.5% with variations based upon administration route and interval.​[[24]](#Raymond2019)​[[26]](#vonHertzen2007)​[[27]](#Carbonell2003) Patients with contraindications to mifepristone or methotrexate may consider a misoprostol-only regimen, but its role in MA is primarily in combination with mifepristone (most commonly) or methotrexate.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) See [Table 3](#regimens) for dosing regimen and [Table 4](#dt) for adverse effects.

#### Methotrexate

Methotrexate is a potent folate antagonist. It blocks the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is required for DNA synthesis and repair and cellular replication. The rapidly dividing cells of pregnancy are highly susceptible to the effects of methotrexate, resulting in abortion of the pregnancy.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)

Methotrexate is approved in Canada for use as chemotherapy for the treatment of neoplastic diseases and as a DMARD for the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.​[[28]](#MethotrexatePM) It has been used in combination with misoprostol off-label for MA​[[13]](#Costescu2016) and for ectopic pregnancies.​[[29]](#refitem-1162148-3F7B85CB)

Methotrexate is most effective when used in combination with misoprostol for MA.​[[19]](#Zhang2022) A regimen of methotrexate 50 mg (PO or IM) and misoprostol 800 mcg (PV) was shown to be effective in achieving complete abortion rates of 89–96% in pregnancies ≤63 days.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[30]](#Ozeren1999)​[[31]](#Carbonell1998) The methotrexate/misoprostol regimen may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate or cannot access mifepristone.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) See [Table 3](#regimens) for dosing regimen and [Table 4](#dt) for adverse effects.

**Table 3:** Medical Abortion Regimens for Pregnancies ≤63 Days​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

| Regimen | Drug | Day | Route | Dose | Directions | Mean time to Completion​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mifepristone/misoprostol | Mifepristone | 1 | PO | 200 mg | Take 1 tablet orally. | 3.3 days​ [32] |
| Misoprostol | 2 or 3 | Buccal | 800 mcg (4 × 200 mcg) | Place 2 tablets between cheek and gums on each side of mouth; leave in place for 30 min then swallow any remaining pieces with a glass of water. Rest for 3 h. |
| Methotrexate/misoprostol | Methotrexate | 1 | PO or IM | 50 mg | PO: take 50 mg by mouth with a glass of water. IM: administer 50 mg by intramuscular injection. | 7.1 days​ [32] |
| Misoprostol | 4, 5 or 6 | PV | 800 mcg (4 × 200 mcg) | Place 4 tablets high in the vagina. If there is no bleeding or passage of tissue after 24 h, 4 more tablets should be inserted. |
| Misoprostol only | Misoprostol | 1 | PV or SL | 800 mcg (4 × 200 mcg) | PV: place 4 moistened tablets high in the vagina. If there is no bleeding or passage of tissue after 3–24 h, 4 more tablets should be inserted. SL: place 4 tablets under the tongue for 30 min then swallow any remaining fragments with a glass of water. If there is no bleeding or passage of tissue after 3–24 h, 4 more tablets should be taken. | 6.6 h to expulsion; 8 days of vaginal bleeding​ [33] |

[a] Mean time from beginning of treatment to completion of MA.

### Post–Medical Abortion Care

The incidence of bleeding, pain and medication adverse effects varies based upon the regimen used, the route of administration of misoprostol and the gestational age.

#### Bleeding

Patients should be prepared for heavier bleeding and more severe cramping than is experienced with menses. Bleeding generally starts within a few hours of misoprostol administration and may include clots and tissue. Bleeding should be managed with thick, full-sized sanitary pads. Patients should be advised not to use tampons. If the bleeding causes soaking of ≥2 sanitary pads per hour for 2 consecutive hours, 1 pad per hour for 10 consecutive hours, or if the patient experiences dizziness, lightheadedness or a racing heart rate, medical attention should be sought.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)

#### Pain

Patients may experience significant pain and cramping during MA, usually beginning 2–4 hours after misoprostol administration. NSAIDs are considered first-line agents for pain management with as-needed dosing shown to be equivalent to prophylactic dosing.​[[34]](#ReynoldsWright2022) While NSAIDs inhibit the production of new prostaglandins, they do not impact the effectiveness of misoprostol in inducing uterine contractions or pregnancy expulsion.​[[35]](#refitem-1162121-3F7DEF9E) Ibuprofen and naproxen may be recommended to patients for pain management. Note that young and nulliparous women may have higher analgesic needs. Severe pain that is not controlled by analgesics is an indication to seek medical attention. It may be the result of infection or retained products of conception.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)

Prophylactic coadministration of pregabalin 300 mg with misoprostol may reduce subsequent need for ibuprofen or opioids but is associated with increased adverse effects.​[[36]](#Friedlander2018)

A randomized-controlled trial found that oxycodone use was not associated with significant pain reduction or improved overall patient satisfaction.​[[37]](#Colwill2019)

#### Prostaglandin Effects

Prostaglandin effects are common with MA and are generally self-limiting. Patients should be advised that they may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness or thermoregulatory symptoms (chills and fever) on the day they take misoprostol. Of note, vaginal misoprostol is associated with lower incidence of adverse effects.​[[19]](#Zhang2022) Nausea may be treated with dimenhydrinate, ondansetron or doxylamine succinate-pyridoxine and diarrhea may be treated with loperamide.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143) The patient should be advised to seek medical attention if these symptoms continue in the days following MA.

### Potential Complications of Abortion

#### Incomplete Abortion and Ongoing Pregnancy

Symptoms of incomplete abortion may include unexpected heavy bleeding and cramping or, alternatively, absence of anticipated bleeding. Ultrasound can be used to confirm the presence of retained products of conception, including the gestational sac. In the absence of fetal cardiac activity, management may be expectant (wait for products of conception to be expelled), medical (administration of an additional dose of misoprostol to prompt expulsion) or surgical (aspiration). If bleeding is heavy and uncontrolled or infection is suspected, aspiration should be performed. If cardiac activity is present 7–14 days after mifepristone administration, management may consist of misoprostol or aspiration; aspiration is indicated if cardiac activity continues to persist 1 week post-misoprostol.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) Risk factors for incomplete abortion includes higher maternal age, previous pregnancies and history of spontaneous abortion.​[[38]](#Kochman2007)

There are teratogenicity risks associated with misoprostol use including reports of limb abnormalities and Moebius syndrome, a rare neurological disorder affecting the muscles that control facial expression and eye movement. There is a pattern of malformation associated with methotrexate use termed fetal aminopterin/methotrexate syndrome that includes growth deficiencies; facial dysmorphism; and skull, limb and neural defects. There does not appear to be a risk of fetal malformation associated with mifepristone, but teratogenicity data are limited. If MA fails with any of the regimens, surgical evacuation of the uterus should be performed. Patients should be prepared for this possibility during their initial consultation.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)

#### Pelvic Infection

The risk of pelvic infection following MA is very low, with reported rates <1%.​[[39]](#Shannon2004) Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of infection in the 2 weeks following MA, e.g., abdominal or pelvic pain, uterine tenderness, foul-smelling vaginal or cervical discharge, prolonged bleeding or spotting, or fever or chills. Mild infections may be treated with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics; severe infections or those not responding to oral therapy will require treatment with IV antibiotics and evacuation of the uterus if retained products of conception are present.

While there is evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in surgical abortion, data is limited in MA.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) A retrospective analysis of MA infection control initiatives conducted at Planned Parenthood health centres in the United States found that changing from a vaginal to buccal route of misoprostol administration and administering antibiotics either routinely or through a screen-and-treat approach significantly decreased post-MA infections.​[[40]](#Fjerstad2009NEnglJMed) Unfortunately, it was not possible to effectively determine the extent to which each initiative contributed to the decrease. The NNT to prevent a serious infection was large, antibiotic adherence was poor and side effects were significant; therefore, a screen-and-treat approach is preferred over routine antibiotic prophylaxis.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

#### Toxic Shock Syndrome

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus). However, TSS following MA is associated with Clostridium sordellii or Group A streptococcus.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) C. sordellii is a gram-positive anaerobic bacteria that produces toxins that cause severe capillary leakage leading to eventual cardiovascular collapse.​[[41]](#Aldape2006ClinInfectDis) C. sordellii is a rare and transient component of the vaginal flora​[[42]](#Chong2016) that can enter the uterus and cause infections and subsequent TSS during menstruation, childbirth, miscarriage, or medical or surgical abortion. While TSS is very rare following MA, it can have sudden onset and is often fatal; therefore, health-care providers and patients should be familiar with the signs and symptoms. Some of the initial symptoms of TSS may be confused with the prostaglandin adverse effects (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea); the distinctive clinical features of TSS include little or no fever, tachycardia, hypotension, edema, high WBC count, and high hemoglobin level.​[[43]](#Fischer2005NEnglJMed)​[[44]](#Meites2010NEnglJMed) Treatment requires supportive measures, empiric antibiotic therapy and surgical débridement; hysterectomy may be required.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

### Confirmation of Completion of Medical Abortion

Follow-up appointments should be scheduled to ensure completion of medical abortion. The patient may be given the option for an in-clinic or a remote first appointment follow-up,​[[45]](#SchmidtHansen2020) ideally 7 days post-treatment. See the [SOGC guidance](https://www.sogc.org/common/Uploaded files/CANADIAN PROTOCOL FOR THE PROVISION OF MA VIA TELEMEDICINE.pdf) on offering and confirming completion of MA via telemedicine.

#### Patient History

The patient's symptom history is very useful to predict a complete MA. Reports of heavier bleeding and more severe cramping than is experienced with menses and the cessation of pregnancy symptoms are highly suggestive of complete MA. Reports of minimal or no bleeding after the misoprostol dose and continued pregnancy symptoms suggest failed MA.​[[46]](#Jackson2012)​[[47]](#Rossi2004)

#### Beta-hCG

Serum beta-hCG levels decrease rapidly from baseline within 24 hours of pregnancy expulsion. As a result, serial serum beta-hCG may be used to accurately assess completion of MA when a pre-treatment level is available. A decrease ≥80% in serum beta-hCG levels from baseline to 7–14 days post-treatment confirms completion of MA.​[[48]](#Pocius2015)​[[49]](#Fiala2003) Some clinicians may prefer an early follow up, particularly in the event of a PUL; a serum beta-hCG drop of >50% from baseline 24 hours after the misoprostol dosing confirms the completion.​[[13]](#Costescu2016) If the beta-hCG levels have not decreased as anticipated, the patient should be followed until MA completion is confirmed; ectopic pregnancy should be investigated and ultrasound may be indicated. Serum beta-hCG may be used to confirm completion of MA provided via telemedicine when the patient has access to a laboratory to determine the pre- and post-treatment hCG levels.​[[50]](#Wiebe2014)

Beta-hCG may be detected in the urine for ≥4 weeks after MA, limiting the ability of standard high-sensitivity hCG urine tests to accurately assess MA completion. When used in combination with structured patient symptom self-assessment, a low-sensitivity urine hCG test (detection limit 1000 units hCG) at 2 or 4 weeks post-treatment may be of benefit to confirm completion of MA and may present an alternative when in-person follow-up or serum hCG testing are not feasible.​[[51]](#Grossman2011)​[[52]](#Clark2010)​[[53]](#Cameron2012Contraception)​[[54]](#Cameron2015Contraception) However, low-sensitivity hCG urine tests may not be readily available in all areas.

Semi-quantitative urine hCG testing has been shown to be an effective alternative to serum hCG testing in detecting ongoing pregnancy after MA.​[[55]](#Grossman2007Contraception)​[[56]](#Blum2012) Semi-quantitative tests measure the level of hCG in the urine sample with cutoff ranges of 25, 100, 500, 2000 or 10 000 units, thus allowing hCG levels to be compared over time. As with serum hCG, a semi-quantitative urine hCG test is performed on the day of treatment to provide a baseline, then repeated 1 week post-treatment. Medical abortion is considered complete if the follow-up hCG reading has the expected decrease compared to baseline. Semi-quantitative urine hCG tests became available for office use in Canada in 2018; these tests provide an alternative to serum hCG testing.

#### Ultrasound

Ultrasound conclusively confirms whether MA was successful. While it may be used routinely for follow-up, it has not been proven to be superior to other methods in uncomplicated MA. Ultrasound should be performed when there is concern the MA failed or when there are adverse symptoms such as unexpected pain; prolonged, heavy bleeding; or inadequate bleeding. When ultrasound is performed, it is usual to find retained debris in the uterus; treatment to remove the debris is unnecessary if there are no adverse symptoms.​[[13]](#Costescu2016)

### Fertility and Contraception

Medical abortion has no impact on future fertility or pregnancies​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)​[[57]](#Winer2009) with a return of fertility possible as early as 8 days post-MA.​[[58]](#Schreiber2011) Ovulation is restored within 21 days on average, with a range of 8–36 days.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)​[[58]](#Schreiber2011)​[[59]](#Gemzell-Danielsson2015) Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during the next menstrual cycle to avoid inadvertent exposure of the pregnancy to the abortifacients. Hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptive pills, patch, ring, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and subdermal implants may be started on the day of misoprostol administration.​[[59]](#Gemzell-Danielsson2015) Intrauterine devices or system may be placed once the abortion is complete.​[[60]](#SchmidtHansen2020-2)​[[61]](#Roe2017) The timing of insertion of a copper or levonorgestrel-containing IUS must take into consideration the risk of expulsion versus the risk that the patient will not return for delayed insertion.​[[18]](#ACOG2014Bulletin143)​[[62]](#Korjamo2017)​[[63]](#Black2016Part3of4) See Contraception for further information.

### Choices during Breastfeeding

Mifepristone**/**misoprostol should be avoided during breastfeeding, according to the manufacturer. However, limited data suggest that low levels of both drugs are found in the breast milk after administration and breastfeeding can safely be continued during the MA.​[[9]](#refitem-114218-38AB0862)​[[64]](#refitem-1162147-45A78DC5)​[[65]](#UKMiBreastfeeding) A small study of women taking mifepristone demonstrated that the milk concentrations were highest in the 12 hours following ingestion; the calculated relative infant dose was 1.5% of the full dose.​[[66]](#refitem-1162147-45A4C021) Among patients taking misoprostol postpartum, the drug levels in breast milk rise and fall quickly. The mean half-life of misoprostol in breast milk is 1.1 hours.​[[66]](#refitem-1162147-45A4C021) Misoprostol is considered compatible with breastfeeding, but infants should be monitored for transient diarrhea.​[[67]](#refitem-1162148-45A54DA0) No interruption of breastfeeding is necessary.​[[65]](#UKMiBreastfeeding)

Methotrexate is transferred in low amounts into breast milk and is contraindicated.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Counselling patients may alleviate any fears. MA is not associated with any future risk of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, birth defects, preterm or low birth-weight delivery, or mental health conditions.
- Decision aids may assist patients with the decision to continue or abort an unintended pregnancy by increasing knowledge and decreasing internal conflict and anxiety.​[[68]](#refitem-114211-382EEA49) An example of a personal decision guide and other online resources can be found at [www.decisionaid.ohri.ca](https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/docs/das/OPDG.pdf).
- Identify patients who would benefit from referral for counselling. The most significant factor that impacts mental health or well-being following an abortion is a history of mental health conditions or traumatic life events.​[[69]](#refitem-1162151-459CB759) Patients who have had an abortion are not at an increased risk of post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, or lower self-esteem or life satisfaction.​[[69]](#refitem-1162151-459CB759)
- Patients seeking reproductive care in general, and medical abortion care in particular, may have experienced trauma on different levels. Trauma-informed care (e.g., maximizing privacy, choice and safety) should therefore be offered to all patients seeking medical abortion.​[[70]](#Cahill2021)
- “Red flag” symptoms requiring medical attention include excessive vaginal bleeding (>2 sanitary pads/hr for 2 consecutive hr), heavy bleeding or cramping lasting >16 days, chills/fever lasting >6 hours, dizziness, lightheadedness or racing heart, feeling sick for more than 24 hours after misoprostol dose, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
- Timely access to MA is key; the SOGC has developed [guidance](https://www.sogc.org/common/Uploaded files/CANADIAN PROTOCOL FOR THE PROVISION OF MA VIA TELEMEDICINE.pdf) for practitioners for the provision of MA during periods of social disruption or a pandemic.
- Resources for abortion providers, including a [prescriber's checklist](https://www.caps-cpca.ubc.ca/AnnokiUploadAuth.php/e/ee/Canadian_Medical_Abortion_Prescribers_Checklist.pdf) and other information, can be found at the [Canadian Abortion Providers Support](https://www.caps-cpca.ubc.ca/index.php/Main_Page) (CAPS) website.
- Misoprostol alone or in combination with mifepristone may be used in the management of incomplete abortion and intrauterine fetal demise. For more information, consult the [WHO guidance of medical management of abortion.](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/278968/9789241550406-eng.pdf?ua=1)
- Letrozole (10 mg orally each day for 3 days) followed by misoprostol may be a safe and effective option for medical termination of pregnancy up to 14 weeks of gestation​[[11]](#WHO2022)​[[19]](#Zhang2022). It has been added to the WHO guidelines as a possible alternative for mifepristone/misoprostol but is currently not approved in Canada for this indication. Additionally, more studies are required to compare its safety and effectiveness in comparison with a mifepristone/misoprostol combination.

### Algorithms

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad796343e1554) Absolute contraindications include chronic renal failure, inherited porphyria, uncontrolled asthma, known hypersensitivity to medications, ambivalence. Multiple pregnancies are not a contraindication to medical abortion. Relative contraindications include an unconfirmed gestational age, intrauterine device in place, long-term corticosteroids or hemorrhagic disorders.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd796343e1557) Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include previous ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery/ligation, pregnancy conceived with assisted reproduction techniques, IUD in place or history of pelvic inflammatory disease or salpingitis.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd796343e1560) The manufacturer of MIFE/MISO states that all patients should receive an ultrasound prior to medical abortion. Those who proceed with a medical abortion who are certain of their LMP and not getting an ultrasound are considered to have a pregnancy of unknown location.

[[d]](#fnsrc_figfndd796343e1563) Contraceptives, excluding the IUD, can be started on the day following MISO administration. The IUD can be inserted at the follow-up appointment to confirm termination of pregnancy.

**Abbreviations:**

hCG
:   human chorionic gonadotropin

IUD
:   intrauterine device

LMP
:   last menstrual period

MIFE
