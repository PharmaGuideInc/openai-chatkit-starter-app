### Introduction

Performance-enhancing drugs in sports has a long and complex history. Earliest reports include Olympic athletes of ancient Greece using herbs and mushrooms in an attempt to improve athletic performance.​[[1]](#psc1050n01020)​[[2]](#psc1050n1001)​[[3]](#Noakes2004) The first effective use of performance-enhancing drugs was during the Second World War where soldiers widely used amphetamines to decrease fatigue.​[[4]](#Rasmussen2008) This practice then carried into competitive sport in the 1950s. Now, athletes across a variety of sports and levels of competition continue to use substances that are both permitted and, in some cases, prohibited to improve performance.​[[5]](#Morente-SanchezJAndZabalaM.DopingIn-95030577)

Ergogenic aids are external factors that enhance performance (e.g., running shoes, joint braces, athletic supplements, anabolic steroids). More specifically, ergogenic drug use is defined as “any substance foreign to the body or any physiological substance taken in an abnormal quantity or taken by an abnormal route of administration with the intention to increase athletic performance.”​[[1]](#psc1050n01020) Ergogenic drugs may be prescription, nonprescription, recreational or substances of abuse (e.g., MDMA and cocaine), nutritional supplements, or natural health products. The use of ergogenic drugs (both prohibited and not prohibited) among athletes is widespread.​[[6]](#Ambrose2013) Despite the potential for adverse effects, most athletes view the risk-benefit ratio as favourable.​[[7]](#psc1050n1003)

### Governing Bodies Involved with Drug-Free Sport

Sport organizations have developed anti-doping policies and programs in order to protect the health of the athlete, keep competition fair and protect the spirit of sport.​[[8]](#psc1050n1002) Elite athletes—those destined for national and international competition, including major games like the Olympics—are subject to programs compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Code. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established in 1999 as an independent, international organization.​[[9]](#WADA) WADA completes scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code. The Prohibited List is an annual publication and an international standard of which substances and methods are prohibited in and out of athletic competition.​[[9]](#WADA)

The Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES) is a national nonprofit organization founded on the principles of fair play and drug-free sport.​[[10]](#CCES) CCES is recognized by WADA as Canada’s national anti-doping organization and has been designated by the Canadian sport community as the organization responsible for the implementation of the Canadian Anti-Doping Program ([CADP](https://cces.ca/sites/default/files/content/docs/pdf/2021-cces-policy-cadp-2021-final-draft-e.pdf)).​[[10]](#CCES)

### Prohibited Substances

Sporting organizations that choose to uphold “clean” sport and be compliant with WADA’s code must adhere to WADA’s standards.​[[11]](#WADAProhibitedSubstances) WADA annually publishes the Prohibited List, which includes prohibited drugs and methods in additional to substances on its Monitoring Program.​[[11]](#WADAProhibitedSubstances) Substances included on the Monitoring Program are permitted for use while ongoing review is being conducted to detect potential patterns of misuse.

Substances are included on WADA’s Prohibited List if at least 2 of the following criteria are met: it has the potential to enhance or enhances sport performance; it poses an actual or potential health risk to the athlete; it violates the spirit of the sport.​[[11]](#WADAProhibitedSubstances) However, there are some situations where athletes require a medically necessary substance or treatment that is included on the Prohibited List (e.g., insulin, salbutamol, hydrochlorothiazide). If used for the management of medical condition, the individual athlete may apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE).

[Table 1](#psc1050n01017) outlines WADA’s categories and examples of drugs that may be observed in practice.

**Table 1:** Overview of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List​[[a]](#afn28752)​[[12]](#psc1050n1009)

| Substance Category | Examples | Rationale for Use in Sports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Substances Prohibited at All Times (In and Out of Competition) |
| Anabolic androgenic steroids and other anabolic agents | Androstenedione Clenbuterol Fluoxymesterone Nandrolone Testosterone Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) Stanozolol | Increase muscle mass and strength. |
| Beta 2 -agonists | Formoterol Salbutamol Salmeterol Terbutaline Note: The use of inhaled formoterol, salbutamol and salmeterol is permitted at therapeutic doses. | Increase lung function and exercise capacity when inhaled. Anabolic effects via routes other than inhalation, although evidence is inconclusive or conflicting. |
| Diuretics and masking agents | Acetazolamide Desmopressin Furosemide Hydrochlorothiazide Probenecid Spironolactone Triamterene | Promote urinary excretion resulting in rapid weight (fluid) loss. An outcome often sought in competition based on athlete body weight (e.g., wrestling, boxing, weight lifting). Used as a “masking agent” to promote excretion of prohibited substances. |
| Hormone and metabolic modulators | Anastrozole Clomiphene Exemestane Fulvestrant Letrozole Raloxifene Tamoxifen | Suppresses the side effects of anabolic steroids and suppresses estrogen. |
| Insulin Note: Insulin is permitted for athletes with certified insulin-dependent diabetes. A Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) form may be required. | Insulin prevents newly generated muscle from being broken down. Improves muscle stamina in long-distance runners. |
| Peptide hormones, growth factors, related substances and mimetics | Erythropoietin (EPO) | Increases red blood cell production, thereby increasing aerobic capacity. |
| Chorionic gonadotropin (in males) Luteinizing hormone (in males) | Stimulates testes to produce more testosterone. |
| Growth hormone and other growth factors | Improves tissue healing and more rapid recovery from injuries. |
| Prohibited Methods (manipulation of blood and blood components; chemical and physical manipulation; gene and cell doping) | Intravenous (IV) infusions and/or injections over 100 mL per 12‑hour period​ [b] | Used to manipulate plasma volume levels to mask prohibited substances. |
| Substances Prohibited in Competition Only |
| Cannabinoids | Natural or synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) Synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the effects of THC​ [c] | Used to improve performance (e.g., decrease anxiety, improve focus, decrease pain). Literature does not support claims of athletic improvement.​ [13] |
| Corticosteroids | Fluticasone Hydrocortisone Methylprednisolone Prednisone Note: Administration by inhalation or intra-articular routes is not prohibited in competition. Administration by oral, IV, intramuscular or rectal routes are prohibited. | Used to decrease fatigue and increase glycogen reserves.​ [14] |
| Narcotics | Buprenorphine Fentanyl Hydromorphone Methadone Oxycodone |  |
| Stimulants | Cocaine Ephedrine Epinephrine Fenfluramine Methylhexaneamine (Dimethylamylamine [DMAA]) Methylphenidate Modafinil Phentermine Pseudoephedrine​ [d] Note: The 2020 Monitoring Program includes bupropion, caffeine, nicotine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pipradrol and synephrine. These substances are not prohibited. | Used to decrease fatigue, decrease reaction time and improve body composition.​ [15] |
|  |
| Substances Prohibited in Particular Sports |
| Beta 1 -adrenergic antagonists | Acebutolol Atenolol Bisoprolol Carvedilol Labetalol Metoprolol Propranolol Note: Prohibited in competition only in the following sports: automobile, billiards, darts, golf, skiing, snowboarding, underwater sports. Prohibited at all times in the following sports: archery, shooting. | Used to reduce anxiety, hand tremor and heart rate. For example, a competitive archer would strive to shoot between heartbeats to improve accuracy. |

[a] This list is not exhaustive; see www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/prohibited-list for a complete, up-to-date list.

[b] Permitted if legitimately received in the course of a hospital treatment, surgical procedure or clinical diagnostic investigation.

[c] Cannabidiol (CBD) is NOT a prohibited substance. However, it may contain detectable amounts of THC in competition.

[d] Pseudoephedrine: Although the urinary threshold (greater than 150 ug/mL) should not be attained with therapeutic use of pseudoephedrine, WADA suggests discontinuing the drug 24 hours before competition. Pseudoephedrine is commonly included in over-the-counter cough and cold products. Athletes who are suffering from illness prior to competition may inadvertently consume pseudoephedrine.

### Drugs and Supplements Commonly Used to Enhance Athletic Performance

While variations in product use exist depending on athlete demographics and specific sports, some drugs and supplements are frequently used to enhance athletic performance (see [Table 2](#psc1050n00003)). Although supplement use is widespread among athletes, there are potential considerations in terms of adverse effects or the possibility for contamination as they are not a regulated health product.

**Table 2:** Drugs and Supplements Commonly Used to Enhance Athletic Performance

| Substance/Class | Reason for Use | Adverse Effects to Consider | Evidence for Performance Enhancement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amino acids (e.g., branched chain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine and valine) | Promote muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle growth. May also prevent muscle fatigue. | Gritty taste. | Increased time to exhaustion in untrained or lightly trained athletes.​ [16] Supplementation is generally not required if dietary protein intake is sufficient.​ [17] |
| Analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) | Treatment of pain or injury. | Increased pain tolerance could potentially lead to further aggravating injury. Some evidence suggests that prolonged use of NSAIDs attenuates muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in younger athletes. The practical implications on sport performance has yet to be established.​ [18] ​ [19] | Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are equally effective in controlling pain following a soft tissue injury. |
| Creatine (e.g., creatine monohydrate) | Improve strength and power output during resistance exercise. Increase lean body mass.​ [20] ​ [21] ​ [22] ​ [23] | Weight gain, stomach upset, flatulence.​ [22] ​ [23] ​ [24] Anecdotal reports triggered investigations regarding renal dysfunction. However, after extensive review, there has been no compelling research that creatine negatively affects renal function in healthy patients or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction.​ [23] ​ [25] ​ [26] | Evidence to support in power sports but not endurance sports.​ [27] ​ [28] ​ [29] |
| Protein supplements (e.g., whey, casein, soy, egg) | Improve muscle hypertrophy and maintenance.​ [30] ​ [31] Improve body composition.​ [32] When total daily protein targets are difficult to reach via diet, supplemental protein is often used. | Variable palatability, upset stomach, flatulence.​ [17] Several, long-term investigations have demonstrated protein intake above the current recommendation for athletes has no negative impacts on blood lipids or renal or hepatic function.​ [33] Patients with pre-existing hepatic or renal conditions should be cautious when quickly increasing protein consumption.​ [17] | Improve muscle gain with resistance exercise, limit muscle loss during low-calorie diets and modestly limit fat gain during caloric surplus.​ [17] ​ [31] ​ [33] ​ [34] Limited research on the benefits of protein supplementation on endurance exercise.​ [33] |
| Stimulants (e.g., caffeine, ginseng, tyrosine) | Increase alertness, reduce perception of fatigue, increase endurance.​ [17] | Nervousness, insomnia, tremors, diuresis, increased blood pressure.​ [35] Stimulant products most commonly responsible for emergency department visits related to dietary supplements (e.g., palpitations, chest pain).​ [36] | No evidence to support; theoretical benefit based on pharmacologic actions. Found in many cold preparations. |

### Creatine

Creatine is a widely used supplement among athletes. It is a naturally occurring compound, and most individuals consume 1–2 grams of exogenous creatine daily, primarily from meat and fish.​[[27]](#psc1050n1010) Creatine may improve performance in power sports (e.g., weight lifting, sprinting) but has demonstrated less benefit in endurance sports (e.g., cycling, cross-country running).​[[27]](#psc1050n1010)​[[28]](#psc1050n1011) Creatine, specifically creatine monohydrate, has become a supplement of choice among athletes due to robust literature supporting use, minimal side effects and low cost.

Creatine is often supplemented with a loading dose protocol of 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day) for 5–7 days. Following the loading dose, a maintenance dose of 0.03 g/kg/day is suggested.​[[23]](#Buford2007) While side effects of creatine are usually minimal, upset stomach has been reported and may be alleviated by spacing the dose throughout the day. Weight gain may also be noted due to fluid retention and increased lean body mass.​[[23]](#Buford2007)​[[24]](#Kutz2003)

Historically, there have been safety concerns questioning negative impacts on renal function with creatine use. Several scientific reports have demonstrated that creatine does not compromise renal function in healthy athletes or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction.​[[23]](#Buford2007)​[[25]](#Mayhew2002)​[[26]](#Schilling2001) Creatine supplementation may increase serum creatinine levels, but this is not indicative of renal damage.

### Protein Supplements

The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends exercising individuals target a protein intake of 1.4–2 g/kg/day.​[[33]](#Jager2017) Slight variability exists between expert groups regarding the recommended range for protein intake among athletes.​[[37]](#AndealORG) A higher protein intake (2.3–3.1 g/kg/day) may be beneficial in resistance-trained athletes during hypocaloric periods to retain lean body mass.​[[33]](#Jager2017) Although many athletes may consume adequate protein from diet alone, others may require supplemental protein or may prefer it due to convenience or to minimize total caloric intake.​[[33]](#Jager2017)

The optimal timing of protein ingestion relating to physical activity may be left to individual preference, as both ingestion prior to or postexercise are beneficial. However, the anabolic effects of exercise are most prevalent immediately postexercise and diminish gradually over a 24‑hour period.​[[33]](#Jager2017)

With an abundance of protein supplements (e.g., powders, shakes, bars) available on the market and often sold within pharmacies, it can be challenging to assist patients in making a proper selection. Many products are a blend of different protein sources and formulations. However, despite marketing campaigns, no specific blend is superior over another. Recommendation should be guided by the athlete’s specific needs and preferences regarding protein source and formulation.

**Protein Source**

Protein supplements are made from various sources. The most popular are whey and casein (or a blend of these 2 sources). However, patients with dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, lactose intolerant) may prefer egg‑ or soy-based supplements. Soy‑based products may flag concerns regarding phytoestrogens in select patients.

**Formulation**

Concentrates are the most common and economical formulation and are often an appropriate first option. It is possible that some athletes may experience upset stomach from a concentrate and therefore it would be reasonable to try an isolated formulation. An isolate is a further purified concentrate that contains a higher amount of protein per serving. Hydrolysates are a predigested protein formulation that allow for faster absorption. Some athletes deem this as desirable to aid in faster protein consumption post-training, but these products can have a bitter taste.

### Anabolic Steroids

Anabolic steroids are the most commonly known prohibited substances in sports. They are synthetic derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone.​[[1]](#psc1050n01020) Individuals use anabolic steroids primarily to increase muscle mass and strength. Athletes who take anabolic steroids often employ unusual dosing regimens in an attempt to increase the effects of the drugs, prevent detection or decrease the occurrence of drug-related adverse effects. “Stacking” is a technique where several different anabolic agents (oral and injectable) are used concomitantly in order to produce a synergistic effect. “Cycling” is a dosing technique with on and off periods of drug use. “Pyramiding” is another dosing technique where low doses are initiated, increased to a plateau 10–100 times the recommended therapeutic dose and then tapered to the original level.​[[1]](#psc1050n01020)​[[7]](#psc1050n1003)​[[38]](#psc1050n1006) Adverse effects can include hepatotoxicity, acne, gynecomastia in males, masculinization in females and psychiatric effects (e.g., aggression and mood disorders).​[[39]](#refitem-1232112-9504B8BF) Much of what is known about the side effects of anabolic steroids involves patients receiving therapeutic doses for treatment of disease. The adverse effects of the high doses used in some doping regimens are not well documented.

### The Health-Care Professional’s Role in Supporting Athletes

Athletes who may benefit from medical and pharmaceutical advice are often overlooked by health-care professionals. Balanced advice can be offered to athletes who place a high value on testimonials. Additionally, there is demand specifically from athletes for support with drug and natural health product use.​[[6]](#Ambrose2013)

Barriers do exist in providing pharmaceutical support to athletes. A lack of adequate resources and scientific literature inhibits health-care professionals from confidently providing evidence-based recommendations. Reliable resources specific to athletes can be found in the Resources section.

Although athletes are a niche patient population, their needs remain diverse. There are many instances of athletes knowingly taking prohibited substances or using prohibited methods in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage.​[[40]](#SmithMorris2018) An additional concern is that athletes may not realize substances are prohibited if they are medically required and recommended by a health-care provider. The following are 3 broad groups of athletes and specific pharmaceutical support that may be appropriate.

- **Athletes who knowingly take prohibited substances (e.g., anabolic steroids)**

  Suggested pharmacist intervention: harm reduction strategies (e.g., clean needles and sharps containers)
- **Athletes who take permitted ergogenic substances (e.g., creatine) but want to avoid taking prohibited substances**

  Suggested pharmacist interventions:

  - Use the WEIGHT$ acronym​[[41]](#SmithMorris2015) to make supplement recommendations (see [Table 3](#WEIGHTSAcronym))
  - Complete a medication review to identify inadvertent use of prohibited substances;​[[40]](#SmithMorris2018) the Global Drug Reference Online [(Global DRO)](https://www.globaldro.com/home/index) can be a useful tool for reviewing medications
  - Assist athlete in complying with anti-doping requirements by helping them to navigate and understand the scientific language of WADA Prohibited List​[[11]](#WADAProhibitedSubstances)
- **Athletes who require medications for medical conditions (e.g., insulin for type 1 diabetes)**

  Suggested pharmacist interventions:

  - Complete a medication review to identify inadvertent use of prohibited substances;​[[40]](#SmithMorris2018) the [(Global DRO)](https://www.globaldro.com/home/index) can be a useful tool for reviewing medications
  - Assist athlete in complying with anti-doping requirements by helping them to navigate and understand the scientific language of WADA Prohibited List​[[11]](#WADAProhibitedSubstances)
  - Check exemption requirement using the [Medical Exemption Wizard](https://cces.ca/medical-exemptions) and by completing a Therapeutic Use Exemption when applicable​[[21]](#Butts2018)

**Table 3:** WEIGHT$ for Health-Care Professionals Addressing Questions on Athletic Supplements

|  | Discussion Point | Explanation | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W | What’s the goal? | Determine what the athlete wishes to achieve by taking the product | Knowing the athlete’s goal may allow you to consider alternative supplements |
| E | Exercise type? | What is the athlete’s main type of exercise (e.g., endurance, strength)? | Product efficacy may differ depending on exercise type |
| I | Indicate who recommended supplement | Who recommended the supplement (e.g., health-care provider, teammate, trainer) | Allows for collaboration among health-care providers |
| G | Gather personal history and investment | Gather the athlete’s medical and medication history. Determine how invested the athlete is in taking this particular supplement (or supplements in general) | Balance the athlete’s personal desire |
| H | How effective is the supplement? | Will this product assist the athlete in achieving the desired goal? | Efficacy and safety data should ideally guide the recommendation |
| T | The risk of the supplement? | Is the product relatively safe for this individual (e.g., side effects, drug interactions, contraindications, allergies, potential prohibited substance)? | Primary concern is patient safety |
| $ | Cost-effective? | Is the potential efficacy worth the cost of the supplement? | Allow athlete to balance cost with potential benefit |
