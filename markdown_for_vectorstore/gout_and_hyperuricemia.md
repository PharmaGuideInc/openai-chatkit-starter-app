CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women,” “female,” “men” and “male” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Gout is a disease in which monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposit in joints; soft tissues such as cartilage, tendon and bursa; or in renal tissues such as glomeruli, the interstitium and tubules. This can result in gouty arthritis, tophi, nephropathy or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Gouty arthritis is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis in men >40 years of age. The mean age of onset is the fourth decade in males and the sixth decade in females. It is unusual for an attack to occur before age 30 in males and age 50 in females unless the patient has an inherited enzyme abnormality. The incidence and prevalence of gout is increasing, reflecting the fact that at-risk populations are increasing.

An association between gout and metabolic syndrome has been established,​[[1]](#c0058n00146) as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged men diagnosed with gout.​[[2]](#c0058n00145) Studies have also shown that greater reduction of serum uric acid levels is associated with greater preservation of renal function.​[[3]](#c0058n00168)

This chapter discusses the 4 stages of gouty arthritis: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, gouty flare, intercritical gout (prophylaxis of gouty flare and management of hyperuricemia) and chronic tophaceous gout (chronic gouty arthritis). For the treatment of acute gouty arthritis, see [Figure 1](#c0058n00012) and for management during intercritical gout see [Figure 2](#c0058n00025).

### Goals of Therapy

- Terminate the acute attack of arthritis
- Prevent recurrence
- Prevent or reverse complications
- Treat associated disorders

### Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia

### Assessment and Risk Factors

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia refers to elevated serum urate levels (>360 µmol/L in females and >420 µmol/L in males) without any clinical manifestations.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) During puberty, male serum urate levels increase by 60–120 µmol/L to levels of 240–360 µmol/L. Women develop increased urate levels after menopause, when values approach those of men. In 70% of patients with hyperuricemia, an underlying cause is discovered by history and physical examination.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) Drugs and systemic conditions that may be associated with hyperuricemia are shown in [Table 1](#c0058n00006). Hyperuricemia is not an indication for urate-lowering therapy. Most patients with hyperuricemia remain asymptomatic throughout life. Causes of uric acid overproduction should be assessed in certain patients, such as those with onset before 25 years of age and those with history of urolithiasis.​[[4]](#c0058n00164)

This phase ends with the first attack of gouty arthritis or urolithiasis (stones in the urinary collecting system), typically after 20 years of sustained hyperuricemia. The annual incidence of acute arthritis is 0.1–0.5% among patients with a urate level between 420 and 540 µmol/L, and 5% when it is >540 µmol/L.​[[7]](#c0058n00036) Similarly, the risk of nephrolithiasis increases with an increasing serum urate level and an elevated measurement for 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion.

### Gouty Flare

### Investigations

- History:

  - precipitants of acute attacks: acute illness, surgery, trauma, alcohol, high purine diet and drugs (see [Table 1](#c0058n00006))
- Physical examination:

  - pattern/location of joint/bursa involvement: predilection for damaged joints with osteoarthritis; acute gouty bursitis may occur in prepatellar or olecranon bursa
  - character of episode: abrupt onset of excruciating pain and inflammation of joint during the night or early morning; patients cannot tolerate even light pressure, such as a bedsheet, on the affected joint
  - time-course of episode: attacks often resolve spontaneously over 3–10 days but may last longer in someone who has been diagnosed >10 years prior
  - presence of tophus
- Laboratory tests:

  - serum urate: serum urate level can be difficult to interpret, as a normal level does not necessarily rule out an acute gout attack​[[8]](#c0058n00205)
  - synovial fluid analysis for monosodium urate crystals
  - ultrasound, dual-energy CT or x-ray: evidence of urate deposition or evidence of joint damage

Gout most commonly affects joints of the lower limb. There is a higher frequency of upper limb joint involvement in women compared with men.​[[9]](#c0058n00115) About 85% of first attacks are monoarticular; however, older patients often have a polyarticular presentation. Podagra (inflammation of the first metatarsophalangeal [MTP] joint) is involved in >50% of first attacks. With time, >90% of patients develop podagra. Other joints involved include, in decreasing order, insteps, ankles, heels, knees, wrists, interphalangeal joints and elbows.

Presumptive diagnosis of gout requires the triad of acute monoarthritis, hyperuricemia and dramatic response to colchicine. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of intracellular monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid. The 2015 ACR/EULAR (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) gout classification criteria​[[10]](#refitem-1182121-B6F5F438) are shown in [Figure 3](#c0058n10170). Patients need a score of ≥8 out of 23 to fulfill the classification criteria for gout. The sensitivity and specificity are 92% and 89%, respectively.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Topical ice application to help reduce inflammation is an appropriate adjunctive therapy to 1 or more pharmacologic treatments for acute gouty arthritis.​[[11]](#c0058n00165)​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Treatment of a gout flare should be initiated as quickly as possible after onset (see [Figure 1](#c0058n00012)).

Colchicine, NSAIDs or **corticosteroids** are appropriate first-line options in therapy of acute gout.​[[11]](#c0058n00165) Treatment should be initiated within the first 24 hours of acute gout attack onset.

Traditionally, colchicine 0.6 mg was given each hour until there was control of inflammation, a total dose of 6 mg was reached or GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps or diarrhea) limited further use.​[[13]](#c0058n00180) The current recommendation is to give 1.2 mg initially, then another 0.6 mg 1 hour later (for a total of 1.8 mg colchicine); a prophylactic dose of 0.6 mg once to twice daily can be started 12 hours after the last treatment dose. This regimen is equally effective, with a much lower incidence of side effects.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)​[[14]](#c0058n00132) Colchicine may have extra-articular benefits; a cohort study demonstrated that amongst patients with gout, new users of colchicine had a 49% decreased risk of cardiovascular events and a 73% reduction in all-cause mortality.​[[15]](#refitem-1212113-AC100893)

NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and swelling in gout flare.​[[16]](#c0058n00208) They are initiated at high doses then quickly reduced once improvement occurs (see [Table 2](#c0058n00032)). Adverse effects are more frequent in older patients with renal dysfunction. High-dose celecoxib may be as effective as nonselective NSAIDs in reducing pain and is associated with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability.​[[17]](#c0058n00178) In patients at risk for ulcer complications (e.g., age >65, previous GI bleed, comorbid medical conditions, low-dose aspirin or anti-coagulant use), consider using celecoxib with a proton pump inhibitor first. Alternatives are celecoxib alone or secondarily a nonselective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor.​[[18]](#c0058n00147) NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and heart failure. The risk is increased with higher doses and long-term use. NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with heart disease or at increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Corticosteroids are a third option for gout flare therapy.​[[11]](#c0058n00165)​[[19]](#c0058n00181) An oral corticosteroid option includes a short-term course of prednisone, e.g., 0.5 mg/kg daily. Systemic corticosteroids were shown to be as effective as NSAIDs in reducing pain (at rest or with activity), as well as in time-to-resolution of symptoms.​[[20]](#refitem-1212118-6B20F28B) With short-term (<21 days) systemic therapy, tapering regimens are not usually necessary. Intra-articular, IM or IV corticosteroids are particularly useful in patients unable to tolerate oral therapy. The intra-articular injection of corticosteroids into a single joint at the time of diagnostic arthrocentesis is ideal therapy and usually results in rapid control of inflammation and symptoms. The intra-articular route may not be suitable for polyarticular joint involvement.

Combination therapy is an appropriate option, particularly when symptoms are severe, the attack is polyarticular or large joints are involved.​[[11]](#c0058n00165) It may also be indicated in patients not responding to monotherapy. Combinations may include colchicine plus an NSAID; colchicine plus oral corticosteroids; or intra-articular corticosteroids plus an NSAID, oral corticosteroid or colchicine.

Recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) receptor inhibitors such as anakinra​[[21]](#c0058n00125) and canakinumab​[[22]](#c0058n00141)​[[23]](#c0058n00209) are recommended for gout flare in patients who have failed or cannot take colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.​[[11]](#c0058n00165)​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) Based on a review of 3 studies comparing canakinumab 150 mg single SC injection and triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg single IM injection, there is moderate-quality evidence of reduction of pain and swelling, as well as patient-reported good or excellent treatment response.​[[23]](#c0058n00209) Adverse effects were more common in the canakinumab group and included back pain, arthralgias, headache and hypotension.​[[23]](#c0058n00209)​[[24]](#c0058n00194) IL-1 inhibitors should be avoided in patients with concurrent infection. IL-1 inhibitors are not approved for the treatment of acute attacks of gout in Canada.

### Therapeutic Tips

- The earlier therapy is started, the more quickly the attack will be resolved.
- Do not stop or alter the dose of urate-lowering drugs during an acute attack, because symptoms may be exacerbated or prolonged.

### Intercritical Gout and Prophylaxis

### Introduction

Intercritical gout is the asymptomatic phase between flares; therapeutic focus is on prevention of gouty flare and management of hyperuricemia. Most patients have a second attack within 6–24 months of the first. Subsequent attacks are more frequent, severe and enduring and lead to permanent joint damage. These attacks are often polyarticular with upper extremity involvement and constitutional symptoms. Erosive radiographic changes and tophi may develop during intercritical gout, especially with frequent attacks of gouty arthritis. About 12–58% of patients have urate crystals in synovial fluid during this phase.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) See [Figure 2](#c0058n00025) for suggested management of hyperuricemia during intercritical gout.

### Investigations

- History:

  - assess diet and lifestyle
  - assess comorbid conditions and intake of drugs that are associated with hyperuricemia (see [Table 1](#c0058n00006))
- Physical examination:

  - evaluate disease burden, including:

    - number of tophi
    - frequency and severity of gout attacks
  - height and weight for BMI
  - blood pressure
- Laboratory tests:

  - CBC with differential, lipid panel, HbA1c, liver function tests and serum creatinine
  - urinalysis
  - renal ultrasound
  - urine uric acid quantification
  - serum urate level

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

There is a clear relationship between obesity and gout, so patients with obesity should try to lose weight. Encourage patients to exercise regularly, quit smoking, remain well hydrated and follow a healthy diet, as indicated below.​[[4]](#c0058n00164) Such lifestyle changes can reduce serum urate by 10–18%.​[[24]](#c0058n00194) The ACR recommends the following lifestyle guidelines:​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

- Limit purine intake, regardless of disease activity. Avoid organ meats high in protein such as sweetbreads, liver and kidney. Limit consumption of beef, lamb, pork and seafood with high purine content (sardines and shellfish).
- Limit high-fructose corn syrup intake, regardless of disease activity.
- Limit alcohol intake, regardless of disease activity (particularly beer, but also wine and spirits), to <2 servings per day for men or <1 serving per day for women; avoid any alcohol consumption during periods of frequent gout attacks or in poorly controlled gout.
- Use a weight loss program (no specific program endorsed) for those patients with gout who are overweight/obese, regardless of disease activity.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) includes **xanthine oxidase inhibitors** and **uricosurics** (see [Table 2](#c0058n00032)). The 2020 ACR guidelines recommend initiating ULT for gout patients with any of the following:​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

- ≥1 subcutaneous tophi
- >1 previous flare, but other flares are infrequent
- Frequent gout flares, with frequent being defined as ≥2 annually
- Comorbid moderate-to-severe (stage ≥3) chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Urolithiasis
- Evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout
- Serum urate concentration >535 µmol/L

ULT is not recommended in patients who are experiencing their first gout flare and in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

##### Treat-To-Target

A treat-to-target approach has been recommended by the ACR​[[4]](#c0058n00164)​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) and EULAR.​[[5]](#refitem-1182144-AFC19B99)​[[25]](#refitem-1182125-BC095F09) The minimum serum urate target is <360 µmol/L, the saturation point of monosodium urate in the extracellular fluid.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) A lower serum urate target (<300 µmol/L) is recommended in patients with more severe gout (e.g., patients with tophaceous gout) to facilitate the improvement of signs and symptoms through the dissolution of urate crystals. Once the urate crystals have dissolved, a maintenance serum target should be <360 µmol/L to avoid the development of new tophi.

The treat-to-target approach promotes the upward titration of medication dose; it results in fewer episodes of acute flares during the initiation phase, and lifelong treatment prevents long-term recurrences. If upward titration of the initial xanthine oxidase inhibitor does not lead to serum target urate level or is not tolerated, substitution with another xanthine oxidase inhibitor is an appropriate option. Combination therapy (i.e., 1 xanthine oxidase inhibitor and 1 uricosuric agent such as probenecid, or losartan) is also appropriate if the serum urate target level has not been achieved.

The ACP found insufficient evidence to support the benefits of dose escalation versus the harms of drug therapy and the necessary repeated monitoring. Therefore, the ACP recommends against initiating urate-lowering therapy in patients after an initial attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. Instead they suggest directing dosage requirement toward minimizing symptoms and not serum urate level. However, some experts find such an approach compromises patient care, as there is scientific evidence (although not from randomized controlled trials) to support a treat-to-target approach. A published abstract from the ACR annual meeting in 2016 examined the safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation in patients with gout participating in a randomized controlled trial, including patients with severe CKD.​[[26]](#refitem-1212135-AC2F6988) Compared with dose adjustment based on ClCr, allopurinol dose escalation (50–100 mg increase monthly until target urate levels are achieved) was more likely to reduce serum urate to target (<360 µmol/L).​[[26]](#refitem-1212135-AC2F6988) Dose escalation was well tolerated and there were no significant renal function changes between the standard dosing or the dose-escalation groups.

### Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the mainstay of the treat-to-target approach and can be initiated during a gout flare as long as effective anti-inflammatory treatment has been started. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors include allopurinol and febuxostat and work by inhibiting the production of uric acid.​[[27]](#c0058n00177) A patient should be started on 1 of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors and the dose should be titrated upward every 2–5 weeks to an appropriate maximum dose in order to achieve the target serum urate level. Once the serum urate target is reached, urate levels should be checked every 6 months.

###### Allopurinol

The ACR 2020 guidelines recommend allopurinol as the first-line agent for all patients due to the potential cardiovascular risk with febuxostat, including in those patients with moderate-to-severe (stage ≥3) CKD.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) A starting dose of allopurinol ≤100 mg daily is recommended for patients with normal kidney function; if patients have stage 4 or 5 CKD (GFR ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m​2), the starting dose should be 50 mg daily. Starting with a lower initiating dose of allopurinol reduces gout flares and may also help to reduce severe hypersensitivity reactions. More than half of patients may require a >300 mg daily dose of allopurinol. Traditionally, allopurinol has been dosed for maintenance according to a practical but non-evidence-based algorithm according to kidney function to avoid a severe hypersensitivity syndrome.​[[4]](#c0058n00164)

The risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is about 1 in 1000 patients.​[[4]](#c0058n00164) This can present with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or systemic diseases including rash, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, vasculitis, cytopenia, eosinophilia, and major end-organ disease. The reported mortality rate is 20–25%. Risk factors for AHS include renal impairment, use of thiazide diuretics and high allopurinol starting dose.​[[4]](#c0058n00164) The HLA-B\*5801 genotype is also associated with AHS. Testing for the HLA-B\*5801 allele prior to starting allopurinol is cost-effective and recommended by ACR only for patient populations with a higher prevalence of the allele. This includes patients of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai and African American descent.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

While AHS occurs infrequently, a rash is the most common side effect of allopurinol. Patients with mild reactions can be desensitized, and this is recommended for patients who cannot be treated with other ULT agents.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)​[[28]](#c0058n00046)

###### Febuxostat

The FDA and Health Canada recommended that febuxostat should be used only in patients who have had an inadequate response to allopurinol.​[[29]](#FoodAndDrugAdministration.FDAAddsBo-86DFD052)​[[30]](#HealthCanada.ULORICfebuxostat-Incre-98CBCA8C) This is based on a large postmarketing trial that revealed a greater frequency of adverse cardiovascular events with febuxostat than allopurinol in a high-cardiovascular-risk population.​[[29]](#FoodAndDrugAdministration.FDAAddsBo-86DFD052) Febuxostat showed a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (4.3% vs. 3.2%) and all-cause mortality (7.8% vs. 6.4%) compared with allopurinol.​[[31]](#WhiteWBSaagKGBeckerMAEtAl.Cardiovas-86E04395) In contrast, another large postmarketing open-label safety trial, the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial (FAST), did not find increased cardiovascular events with febuxostat.​[[32]](#MackenzieISFordINukiGEtAl.Long-term-86E09206) The ACR guidelines recommend switching febuxostat to an alternative oral ULT agent in patients with a history of CVD or a new CVD-related event.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)  Febuxostat has been shown to be safe and effective in allopurinol-intolerant patients with advanced CKD and hyperuricemia.​[[33]](#refitem-1212129-AC186D1A) The most commonly reported adverse reactions were liver function abnormalities, nausea, diarrhea, arthralgias and rash. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine due to the risk of severe toxicity from increased plasma concentrations of these drugs. The recommended starting dose of febuxostat is 40 mg daily, and the dose can be titrated up as tolerated.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) Febuxostat is available as 80 mg only, which is also the maximum suggested dose. Note that a daily dose of 120 mg of febuxostat is approved in Europe; the dose of febuxostat may be titrated up to 120 mg daily in patients who continue to have active disease with regular doses.​[[5]](#refitem-1182144-AFC19B99)

Febuxostat has been shown to be relatively safe and effective in patients with mild-moderate and severe CKD.​[[33]](#refitem-1212129-AC186D1A) In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients with hyperuricemia and CKD (stage 3 or 4) who received febuxostat were less likely to have >10% decline in eGFR compared with the placebo group.​[[34]](#refitem-1182141-AEAA9D34)

### Uricosurics

Probenecid is recommended as an alternative first-line urate-lowering therapy, starting with a low dose of 500 mg once or twice daily.​[[4]](#c0058n00164)​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) It is available through Health Canada’s Special Access Program or as a compounded product. Other uricosuric agents that can be used include fenofibrate​[[35]](#c0058n00175) and losartan.​[[36]](#c0058n00176) Choosing losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible is recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is not recommended because the risk of side effects of fenofibrate outweigh the benefits.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) The cholesterol-lowering agent atorvastatin has been reported to lower serum uric acid levels.​[[37]](#MilionisHJKakafikaAITsouliSGEtAl.Ef-708E5AE4) While officially approved as a uricosuric, sulfinpyrazone is rarely used for treating gout, as it requires monitoring for blood dyscrasias and has other noteworthy adverse effects including increased risk of bleeding and skin rashes. Benzbromarone is a uricosuric agent available through Health Canada’s Special Access Program; it may be used in patients not responsive to conventional uricosuric therapy.

Uricosurics are contraindicated in patients with elevated urine uric acid levels (gross overproduction of uric acid). Urine alkalinization is not recommended in patients receiving uricosurics.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) It is important to accurately determine the creatinine clearance in order to select appropriate therapy. Uricosurics should not be used as first-line monotherapy in patients with ClCr <50 mL/min or with urolithiasis.

### Uricases

Uricase, or urate oxidase, metabolizes uric acid to end-product allantoin and is absent in humans. Pegloticase, a recombinant pegylated uricase, is available in the United States for treatment of refractory hyperuricemia (not acute gout).​[[38]](#refitem-1222139-C6F11B1A) It is not recommended as first-line therapy, but used in conditions of severe gout disease burden and/or refractoriness to, or intolerance of, urate-lowering therapy at appropriate doses.​[[3]](#c0058n00168)​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) It is not yet available in Canada. Rasburicase is a uricolytic agent used only for treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia due to tumor lysis syndrome in cancer chemotherapy (see Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy).

### Other

During intercritical gout, nonessential prescription medications that induce hyperuricemia (see [Table 1](#c0058n00006)) should be discontinued. Patients on low-dose ASA should continue therapy if used for prevention of cardiovascular disease.​[[4]](#c0058n00164) However, initiation or dose-adjustment of urate-lowering therapy may be important to prevent recurrent gout flares with low-dose ASA.​[[39]](#c0058n00206) The ACR recommends switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. ​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary supplements to treat chronic gout.​[[40]](#refitem-1212134-AC1C2AFE) Current studies, including those of vitamin C used to lower serum urate, are of low quality.

### Long-Term Benefits of Urate-Lowering Therapy

Continuing ULT indefinitely is recommended although the dose may need altering for changes in renal or hepatic function.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71) There is moderate evidence that urate-lowering therapy reduces the risk of gout flare after 1 year, but not in the first 6 months of starting treatment.​[[41]](#refitem-119216-AC0CDC0F) It is documented that keeping urate levels low over time leads to a decrease or cessation of gout flares, and a decrease in the size of, or resolution of, tophi. Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy may derive extra-articular benefits. Hyperuricemia and gout are associated with incident hypertension,​[[42]](#refitem-1212135-AC3029DF) decline in renal function​[[43]](#refitem-1212136-AC307BB4)​[[44]](#refitem-1212137-AC30F876) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.​[[2]](#c0058n00145) However, it is not clear whether urate-lowering therapy plays a protective role. Allopurinol therapy has been shown to decrease BP in adolescents.​[[45]](#refitem-1212138-AC321E35) Additionally, a long duration of allopurinol use (>180 days) was associated with reduced risk of MI.​[[46]](#refitem-1212139-AC32BEB1) The greatest risk reduction was observed in patients 65–74 and ≥85 years of age, females, and Black patients.​[[46]](#refitem-1212139-AC32BEB1) Other studies have shown no risk reduction in cardiovascular outcomes with allopurinol use.​[[47]](#refitem-1212140-AE3F9A24) There are ongoing larger studies evaluating the effects of urate lowering on cardiovascular disease.

### Prophylaxis of Gout Flares during the Intercritical Period

Initiating any ULT may result in an increased incidence of gout flares. Minimize the risk of acute attacks by protecting with a low-dose **NSAID** or colchicine when starting antihyperuricemic therapy. It is recommended that ULT should be started during the gout flare rather than after the flare has resolved.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

In a study of patients prescribed allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis, colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily was continued for 3 months after attaining a serum urate of <390 µmol/L.​[[48]](#c0058n00118) This therapy effectively reduced the frequency and severity of acute gout flares and reduced the likelihood of recurrence. A lower dose of colchicine 0.6 mg once daily may also be effective.​[[11]](#c0058n00165)

Fatalities have been reported in patients taking recommended doses of colchicine with concomitant medications that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (Pgp), such as clarithromycin.​[[49]](#c0058n00126) Reduce the dose or discontinue colchicine in patients with normal renal and hepatic function if treatment with a Pgp or a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is required (see [Table 2](#c0058n00032)). Concomitant use of colchicine and Pgp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

If there are contraindications to colchicine, substitute a low-dose NSAID (e.g., naproxen 250 mg twice daily). Although indomethacin use was commonly used historically, there is no evidence that one NSAID is more effective than another. Use colchicine and NSAIDs with caution in older patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency or at high risk of a cardiovascular event.

If NSAIDs and colchicine are both contraindicated or ineffective, low-dose prednisone (<10 mg/day) is a second-line option.​[[11]](#c0058n00165)

The 2020 ACR guidelines strongly recommend continuing concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for 3–6 months after urate-lowering therapy initiation; continue prophylaxis as needed if the patient continues to experience gout flares.​[[12]](#FitzGeraldJDDalbethNMikulsTEtAl.202-83C8BC71)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Do not treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia, but investigate the cause of hyperuricemia.
- Improve adherence by explaining the pathophysiology of the disease and the objectives of therapy, e.g., that antihyperuricemic drugs do not relieve pain and must be used continuously long term to prevent the complications from elevated serum urate.
- Refer patients to a specialist in the following situations: unclear cause of hyperuricemia, unable to reach the target serum urate level, persistent symptoms or signs of gout, and multiple and/or serious adverse events from pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy.

### Chronic Tophaceous Gout

### Risk Factors and Management

This stage typically occurs 12 years from onset with a reported range of 3–42 years.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) Only 2% of patients develop severe crippling disease. The strongest associated risk factor for developing tophi (inflammatory nodules) is the serum urate level.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) Other factors include the frequency of attacks, duration of hyperuricemia and severity of renal disease. Common locations of tophi are the synovium, subchondral bone, digits of the hands and feet, olecranon bursa, Achilles tendon, and helix of the ear. However, they can occur anywhere, including the conduction system of the heart. Tophi themselves are painless but they can lead to destruction of joints and deformities. Radiographic changes include paramarginal erosions with sclerotic margins and calcified tophi.​[[6]](#c0058n00035) The optimal therapy for chronic tophaceous gout is prevention through aggressive management of acute gout and correction of hyperuricemia. The aims of therapy are to control pain and inflammation, typically with NSAIDs, and to decrease serum uric acid levels. After several years of therapy, resorption of urate deposits will eventually lead to disappearance of tophi.

### Drug Table

**Table 2:** Drugs Used in the Management of Gout[[a]](#)

| Drug/​Cost[b] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antimitotics**

| colchicine Colchicine Odan , other generics $15–20 | Acute attack: 1.2 mg PO at first sign of flare, then 0.6 mg 1 h later; start prophylactic therapy 12 h later Prophylaxis: 0.6 mg once to twice daily PO | Common at higher doses: abdominal pain and cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Rare: neuropathy, myopathy, bone marrow suppression. | May increase levels of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors; monitor for statin myotoxicity (muscle pain, weakness). Decrease dose and monitor for colchicine toxicity (GI symptoms, fever, leukopenia) if also taking known inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antiretroviral drugs, clarithromycin, erythromycin, azole antifungals, verapamil) or Pgp (e.g., cyclosporine). Fatalities reported with clarithromycin, which inhibits both CYP3A4 and Pgp.​ [49] Avoid grapefruit juice. | For patients >70 y or patients on Pgp inhibitors: treat flares with 0.6 mg PO at once then 0.3 mg PO every other day prophylactically. Use with caution. For patients on strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors: treat flares with 0.6 mg PO followed by 0.3 mg 1 h later and 0.3 mg every other day prophylactically. Colchicine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, or those who are taking strong CYP 3A4 or Pgp inhibitors. |

Lithium: lithium toxicity (monitor lithium levels). | Not an approved use in Canada. Monitor serum creatinine and potassium 7–14 days after initiation of therapy or dose changes. Serum creatinine increase ≤30% expected. |
| probenecid ​ [c] | Starting dose: 500 mg once or twice daily PO May increase by 500 mg every 4 wk if required Maximum: 2 g/day | May precipitate attack during initial phase of therapy; renal calculi, headache, GI irritation, hypersensitivity reactions. | Increases levels of some drugs e.g., benzodiazepines, methotrexate. Salicylates reduce the effect of probenecid. | Liberal fluid intake can help prevent stones. Severe toxicity is rare. |

**Drug Class: Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors**

| allopurinol generics <$5 | Starting dose: 100 mg daily PO Usual: 300 mg daily PO titrated to urate levels; maximum: 800 mg daily PO To improve tolerability, divide doses >300 mg to 2–3 times/day Renal impairment: decrease initial dose to 50 mg/day if ClCr is 30–60 mL/min; 50 mg Q2 days if ClCr <15–30 mL/min | Skin rash, GI upset, hepatotoxicity, fever, severe hypersensitivity syndrome, xanthine stones (rare). May precipitate attack during initial phase of therapy. | Increases half-life of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Dosage reduction of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine required when used concomitantly (one-quarter to one-third of the usual dose). May increase toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Allopurinol inhibits hepatic metabolism of warfarin. Increased incidence of rashes when used with ampicillin or amoxicillin. | May need to increase dose or combine with uricosuric agents in chronic tophaceous gout. To prevent acute attacks on initiation of therapy, give prophylactic NSAID or colchicine for at least 6 months (see Prophylaxis of Gout Flares during the Intercritical Period ). Desensitization to allopurinol can be achieved in some patients, but sensitivity may recur. |
| febuxostat generics ~$45 | Starting dose: 40 mg daily PO; may increase to 80 mg daily after 2 wk if serum uric acid levels remain above 360 µmol/L | Nausea, arthralgia, skin rash (at higher dose). Increased hepatic aminotransferase levels. May precipitate attack during initial phase of therapy. | Azathioprine and mercaptopurine metabolism by xanthine oxidase may be decreased by febuxostat, resulting in significant toxicity. Do not use febuxostat with these drugs. | To prevent acute attacks on initiation of therapy, give prophylactic NSAID or colchicine for 2–3 wk. May increase risk of stroke, MI , cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality compared with allopurinol. |
