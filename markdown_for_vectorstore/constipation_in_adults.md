### Introduction

Constipation is broadly defined as unsatisfactory defecation characterized by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage or both.​[[1]](#refitem-118211-CC1B6894) On the basis of pathophysiological features, there are 3 primary types of constipation: slow transit constipation, defecatory disorders (pelvic floor dysfunction or dyssynergia) and normal transit (functional) constipation.​[[2]](#refitem-119214-DE03AB09) Functional constipation may be more precisely defined by the Rome IV criteria as outlined in [Table 1](#c0112n00158).

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly the constipation-predominant type (IBS-C), is closely related to functional constipation but with an added component of abdominal pain related to bowel movements (see Irritable Bowel Syndrome).​[[3]](#refitem-118212-DC8DEFBA)

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Establishing the potential cause and correcting it are the primary objectives of treatment.

**Table 1:** Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation​[[3]](#refitem-118212-DC8DEFBA)

| The presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms for the past 3 months and symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: Lumpy or hard stools in >25% of defecations Straining in >25% of defecations <3 spontaneous bowel movements per week A sensation of incomplete evacuation in >25% of defecations A sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage in >25% of defecations Manual maneuvers to facilitate >25% of defecations, e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor Loose stools (including laxative-induced) are not present Criteria for irritable bowel syndrome are not met |

### Goals of Therapy

After ruling out “red flag” pathology (see [Table 2](#RedFlagSx)), the ultimate goal of therapy is to improve the patient’s quality of life.

- Establish regular bowel function
- Abolish the need to strain and prevent the adverse effects of straining, e.g., hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, hemorrhoidal prolapse, aggravation of bladder and uterine prolapse in females, coronary and cerebrovascular dysfunction in the elderly
- Prevent complications, e.g., hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal prolapse, stercoral ulcer (ulcer of the colon/rectum caused by fecal pressure and irritation), fecal impaction, fecal incontinence
- Treat complications, e.g., fecal impaction, intestinal obstruction

### Investigations

- History, with special attention to:

  - patient’s definition of constipation. Determine “normal” bowel routine for each patient, e.g., some patients may believe that a daily bowel movement is a sign of health, but this may not be “normal” for everyone. Stool calibre can be objectively characterized with the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see [Figure 1](#BristolStoolScale)).
  - duration of constipation
  - the most distressing features of constipation: infrequency, straining, hard stool, unusual toilet postures to facilitate stool expulsion, need for digital manipulation to stimulate stool expulsion, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, bloating, pain
  - previous laxative use
  - structural abnormalities (previous surgery)
  - dietary fibre and fluid intake
  - physical inactivity or immobilization (more common with increased age)
  - drugs with constipating effects (see [Table 3](#c0112n00157))
  - symptoms of obstructive disease (colonic neoplasm or stricture, anal stricture), painful hemorrhoid or fissure, pregnancy, neuromuscular disease, endocrine disorder (hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypercalcemia), connective tissue disorder (progressive systemic sclerosis)

- Physical examination:

  - abdominal/perineal/rectal examination looking for abdominal and rectal masses, anorectal fissures and hemorrhoids
- Laboratory tests (only in patients whose history suggests the presence of systemic disease):

  - CBC
  - serum electrolytes (including calcium) and creatinine
  - thyroid-stimulating hormone
- Routine use of lower endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) is not recommended. Consider sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy or, rarely, CT colonography if any of the following are present:

  - recent onset of symptoms in patients >50 years of age (screening for colon cancer is recommended in patients ≥50 years of age)​[[5]](#c0112n00029)
  - severe symptoms (symptoms that do not respond to pharmacological management and adversely affect normal daily activities)
  - alarm/red flag symptoms, e.g., weight loss, anemia, rectal bleeding (see [Table 2](#RedFlagSx))
  - family history of colorectal cancer
- Psychological assessment
- Tests to evaluate 2 subtypes of chronic constipation (typically reserved for subspecialty investigation of refractory constipation):
  - slow-transit constipation using radiopaque markers​[[6]](#c0112n00030)​[[7]](#refitem-118215-CC1CD155) or wireless motility capsule​[[7]](#refitem-118215-CC1CD155)
  - dyssynergic defecation/pelvic floor dysfunction (resulting from impaired coordination of rectoanal and pelvic floor muscles) with standard defecography​[[8]](#c0112n00031)​[[9]](#refitem-118217-CC1D582E) or dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) defecography​[[2]](#refitem-119214-DE03AB09) and anorectal manometry​[[9]](#refitem-118217-CC1D582E)​[[10]](#c0112n00032)

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 2](#c0112n00004) outlines the management of constipation in adults. Nonpharmacologic management is generally attempted prior to initiating pharmacologic therapies.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Dietary modifications:

  - Encourage adequate dietary fibre intake (25–38 g/day)​[[11]](#c0112n00033)​[[12]](#HealthCanadaFibre) from sources such as legumes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, flaxseeds, psyllium​[[13]](#c0112n00266) and unprocessed bran.​[[14]](#c0112n00034) Advise patients to increase their daily fibre intake gradually to minimize side effects such as flatulence, bloating and cramping.​[[15]](#c0112n00262)
  - Recommend increased fluid intake (2.2–3 L/day)​[[16]](#DietitiansCanadaWater) to complement the high-fibre diet.

- Behavioural modifications:

  - Encourage a regularly scheduled time for toilet use to develop a conditioned gastrocolic reflex, e.g., after breakfast
  - Advise patients not to ignore the urge to defecate.
  - Advise avoidance of prolonged straining.
  - Advise patients to raise their legs while defecating, either by squatting or using a footstool, as it straightens out the anorectal angle and may facilitate defecation.​[[17]](#Wald2019)
  - Encourage physical exercise.​[[18]](#c0112n00139)

- Discontinue drugs with constipating effects when possible (see [Table 3](#c0112n00157)).
- For constipation due to dyssynergic defecation, recommend physiotherapy, e.g., relaxation exercises for the pelvic floor and external anal sphincter muscles, in conjunction with biofeedback therapy (neuromuscular retraining to restore normal defecation).​[[9]](#refitem-118217-CC1D582E)​[[19]](#c0112n00140)​[[20]](#c0112n00141)
- Digital manipulation of the anal sphincter (such as by insertion of glycerin suppositories) may help in patients with spinal cord injuries.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 4](#c0112n00028) details the drugs used in the management of constipation. In general, use drug therapy only when nonpharmacologic approaches have failed. Moreover, continue to reinforce nonpharmacologic therapy when drug therapy is initiated.

- Bulk-forming agents (e.g., psyllium) may be effective​[[13]](#c0112n00266)​[[27]](#c0112n00265) and can be safely used for long-term therapy but must be taken with adequate fluids. Patients with pelvic floor dysfunction and slow transit constipation may respond poorly to fibre supplementation.​[[28]](#Voderholzer1997)
- The osmotic laxatives polyethylene glycol and lactulose are safe and effective for long-term use.​[[13]](#c0112n00266)​[[29]](#c0112n00252) Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is also safe and effective for use in geriatric patients.​[[30]](#c0112n00260) Whenever possible, use PEG instead of lactulose for the treatment of chronic constipation since it results in greater improvements in stool frequency and stool form, relieves abdominal pain, and reduces the need for additional laxatives.​[[31]](#c0112n00251) The osmotic laxatives magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate and sodium phosphates are less frequently recommended.
- Some stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna) have been shown to be effective for the treatment of acute or chronic constipation.​[[32]](#c0112n00253)​[[33]](#c0112n00255)​[[34]](#c0112n00257) A 2017 network meta-analysis suggested that bisacodyl may be more effective than newer secretagogues and prokinetics in terms of weekly spontaneous bowel movements;​[[35]](#Nelson2017) however, stimulant laxatives are commonly associated with abdominal cramping and diarrhea.​[[36]](#Gattuso1994)
- Linaclotide, an intestinal secretagogue, is indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and IBS-C in adults. As a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist, linaclotide increases chloride and bicarbonate secretions into the intestinal lumen and inhibits the absorption of sodium ions, leading to increased water secretion into the intestine, increased weekly spontaneous bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation. Improvement in abdominal pain and bloating has also been observed.​[[37]](#Lembo2011) Linaclotide has been shown to be generally safe in clinical trials with diarrhea being the predominant adverse effect. As data on long-term efficacy and head-to-head comparisons with other laxatives are lacking and the cost is relatively high, linaclotide should be used selectively; consider only when responses to traditional laxatives such as PEG and bisacodyl have failed.
- Prucalopride, a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist with GI prokinetic activities, is approved for the treatment of idiopathic chronic constipation in females.​[[26]](#c0112n00243) Prucalopride may increase the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week and improve satisfaction with bowel function, perception of constipation severity and patient-assessed symptom scores over a 12-week treatment period with a favourable safety profile.​[[38]](#Camilleri2016) While there is little long-term data, open-label exploratory analyses have shown sustained satisfaction with bowel movements at 18 months​[[39]](#Camilleri2010) and an open-label study demonstrated sustained symptomatic improvement over a 24-month follow-up period in the majority of patients, with a decrease in efficacy after 6 months in one-third of patients.​[[40]](#DhruvaRao2015) Prucalopride is best reserved for initiation by a clinician with experience in treating chronic constipation when conventional laxatives from at least 2 different classes fail to adequately relieve symptoms.​[[25]](#c0112n00247)​[[26]](#c0112n00243)​[[41]](#c0112n00274) The benefit of continuing therapy with prucalopride should be reconsidered if response to treatment is inadequate after 4 weeks.​[[26]](#c0112n00243)
- Rectal suppositories (e.g., glycerin) and enemas (e.g., sodium phosphates) may be used for short-term relief of constipation in patients who feel the urge to defecate but have difficulty evacuating.​[[42]](#Krogh2017) The physical insertion of suppositories may stimulate anorectal motility, particularly in patients with spinal cord dysfunction. Enemas increase the water content of stool and cause rectal distension, which stimulates colonic peristalsis and prompts evacuation.
- Evidence is lacking to support the effectiveness of the stool softeners docusate sodium and docusate calcium in the treatment of any type of constipation, including opioid-induced and functional constipation; therefore, they are not recommended.​[[43]](#c0112n00263)​[[44]](#Pare2014)​[[45]](#refitem-1152127-871A1C56)​[[46]](#refitem-1152128-871A6267)
- Some geriatric patients may benefit from using a combination of laxatives with different mechanisms of action, e.g., bulk-forming agents plus stimulant laxatives.​[[47]](#c0112n00234)
- There is some suggestion that probiotics may decrease colonic transit time and increase defecation frequency; however, given the paucity of high-quality evidence, the role of probiotics in treating constipation is limited.​[[48]](#WGOProbiotics2017)
- Seek the patient’s understanding and cooperation regarding general principles of therapy and monitor laxative tolerance. Although there is not an absolute indication to discontinue chronic laxative use, it is recommended to attempt to do so by gradually reducing the frequency of use over 3–4 weeks while optimizing nonpharmacologic approaches; intermittent use of an osmotic laxative (e.g., polyethylene glycol, magnesium) is recommended until bowel regularity is achieved.

### Management of Opioid-Induced Constipation

- Initial management of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) parallels that of functional constipation; scheduling defecation and increasing activity, fibre and fluid intake are all appropriate. Bulking agents, e.g., psyllium, are unlikely to help as they will not augment the colonic peristalsis induced by opioid receptor agonism.
- Consider dose de-escalation or switching to an equianalgesic dose of a less-constipating opioid; fentanyl patches are less constipating than sustained-release morphine, for example, but provide equivalent levels of pain relief.​[[49]](#Allan2005)
- Prolonged-release naloxone/oxycodone reduces OIC compared with oxycodone alone. There is minimal concern for reduction of central analgesia due to extensive first-pass metabolism of oral naloxone.​[[50]](#MullerLissner2017)
- A stimulant (e.g., bisacodyl, senna) or osmotic (e.g., polyethylene glycol, lactulose) laxative should be started when initiating an opioid in patients who are experiencing constipation or have a history of OIC.
- Naloxegol, a pegylated naloxone derivative, is an oral mu-opioid receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of OIC in adults who have failed treatment with other common laxatives, e.g., osmotic or stimulant laxatives. At the highest daily dose of 25 mg, naloxegol may help such patients achieve ≥3 spontaneous bowel movements per week (less effective for complete spontaneous bowel movements).​[[51]](#Leonard2015) Naloxegol has been shown to be generally safe in clinical trials; diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea and vomiting were the adverse effects most frequently leading to drug discontinuation. Because of its relatively high cost and lack of head-to-head comparison with other established laxatives, naloxegol should be considered as a second-line option in patients not responding to other laxatives.​[[52]](#HealthCanadaMovantik2017)
- Methylnaltrexone, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of OIC in patients receiving palliative care. It is used as an adjunctive treatment when response to laxatives has been insufficient; however, more data are needed to determine its place in therapy.​[[53]](#c0112n00213)
- Linaclotide and prucalopride may be reasonable options for OIC, although evidence is limited and the quality of available evidence is low.​[[54]](#Crockett2019)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Constipation is a common condition during pregnancy; a greater prevalence is observed during the first 2 trimesters relative to the third trimester and the postpartum period.​[[55]](#c0112n00183)​[[56]](#c0112n00184) In late pregnancy, constipation is attributed to increased circulating progesterone, which reduces GI motility.​[[57]](#c0112n00185) Iron supplementation during pregnancy may also contribute to constipation. Constipation in pregnancy is commonly associated with symptoms of straining, hard stools and incomplete evacuation, but not infrequent defecation.​[[55]](#c0112n00183)

### Management of Constipation during Pregnancy

- Encourage nonpharmacologic approaches for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0112n00025)).
- Bulk-forming agents containing psyllium are considered first-line in pregnancy because they are not systemically absorbed.​[[58]](#c0112n00187) With adequate hydration, they increase defecation frequency and soften the stools.​[[59]](#c0112n00188)
- If constipation persists, the laxative effect of a magnesium**-containing** liquid antacid may be helpful and offers the additional benefit of relieving heartburn, which may be frequent during the third trimester.
- Stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl may be recommended short term.​[[58]](#c0112n00187)​[[60]](#Cochrane2015)
- Consider polyethylene glycol and lactulose if constipation is refractory to dietary fibre and stimulant laxatives.​[[58]](#c0112n00187)
- Do not use:
  - docusate (ineffective)​[[58]](#c0112n00187)​[[61]](#c0112n00261)
  - linaclotide (insufficient data to recommend use during pregnancy)
  - prucalopride (not recommended during pregnancy)
  - castor oil (can induce premature uterine contractions)​[[58]](#c0112n00187)
  - mineral oil (can interfere with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins with chronic use ​[[58]](#c0112n00187) and can cause lipoid pneumonia if aspirated)

### Management of Constipation during Breastfeeding

- As in pregnancy, offer nonpharmacologic choices in breastfeeding women.
- Bulk-forming agents are preferred as they are not systemically absorbed, cost less and have a favourable side effect profile.
- Magnesium hydroxide is considered second line.
- Senna and bisacodyl are acceptable to use during breastfeeding;​[[62]](#c0112n00214) however, stimulant laxatives are recommended only for short-term use.
- Do not use:
  - docusate (ineffective)​[[61]](#c0112n00261)
  - linaclotide (insufficient data to recommend use during breastfeeding)
  - prucalopride (not recommended during breastfeeding)
  - **other laxatives** (paucity of data regarding transfer into breast milk)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Perform careful history to determine any potential cause of constipation and whether colonic investigation is indicated.
- Encourage optimum dietary and supplementary fibre along with increased daily fluid intake and regular physical exercise.
- Encourage patient to seek medical advice if constipation worsens or if new symptoms (e.g., rectal bleeding) develop.
- Use laxatives wisely to minimize side effects.
