### Introduction

Dyspepsia is defined as predominant epigastric pain lasting ≥1 month. The patient may experience additional symptoms, e.g., epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting or heartburn, but epigastric pain must be the main concern to be defined as dyspepsia.​[[1]](#refitem-1272118-A4E27AAF) In contrast, the predominant symptom in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is troublesome or frequent acid regurgitation or heartburn (a burning feeling in the stomach or lower chest rising up to the neck).​[[2]](#psc1033n1002) GERD may also be associated with epigastric pain, nausea, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and odynophagia (pain with swallowing).​[[2]](#psc1033n1002) Extraesophageal or atypical manifestations of GERD are also possible and include cough, sore throat, chest pain, hoarseness, shortness of breath and wheezing.​[[2]](#psc1033n1002)​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[4]](#psc1033n1008) It is important to recognize that there is considerable symptom overlap between dyspepsia and GERD, and it may be difficult to differentiate between them in a patient who has not been investigated.​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[4]](#psc1033n1008)​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)

Although the incidence of dyspepsia is poorly documented, the prevalence rate in western countries is approximately 20%.​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[6]](#refitem-127215-9D97BDF3) GERD has a prevalence of approximately 40%, and up to half of the sufferers may show erosive esophagitis upon endoscopic investigation.​[[3]](#psc1033n1003) GERD with a normal esophagus at endoscopy is referred to as nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) or as endoscopy-negative reflux disease (ENRD). Dyspepsia and GERD remain costly chronic conditions where a significant proportion of patients self-manage without seeking medical attention.​[[7]](#psc1033n01062)

### Pathophysiology

### Dyspepsia

Dyspepsia can be caused by identifiable abnormalities such as chronic peptic ulcer disease (PUD), GERD, and gastric or esophageal cancer (see [Table 1](#psc1033n00005)).​[[3]](#psc1033n1003) Dyspepsia is referred to as functional, idiopathic or nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) when no identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities are found (see [Table 1](#psc1033n00005)). The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is considered an overlap of psychosocial factors, upper GI motor abnormalities (delayed gastric emptying, impaired gastric accommodation to meals) and altered organ sensory function (gastric or duodenal hypersensitivity to mechanical distention or nerve-related mechano-sensory dysfunction). In general, the symptoms of dyspepsia are minor and infrequent, although with a relapsing course.​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623)

For further discussion of dyspepsia, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease.

**Table 1:** Causes of Dyspepsia

| Structural abnormalities/identifiable causes (40%): |
|  | Peptic ulcer disease (15–25%) |
|  | Reflux esophagitis (5–15%) |
|  | Gastric or esophageal cancer (<2%) |
|  | Other diseases: e.g., celiac disease, cholecystitis, Crohn disease, diabetic gastroparesis, hepatoma, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, intestinal angina, pancreatitis, renal failure, sarcoidosis |
|  | Food intolerance: e.g., lactase deficiency |
|  | Medications: e.g., acarbose, amiodarone, antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), bisphosphonates, digitalis, iron supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, potassium supplements, theophylline |
|  | Natural health products: e.g., chaste tree berry, feverfew, garlic, white willow |
|  | Infections: e.g., cytomegalovirus, Giardia lamblia , Strongyloides stercoralis |
| No identifiable structural abnormalities or causes (60%) |
|  | Functional or idiopathic (nonulcer) dyspepsia |

### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

The pathogenesis of GERD is multifactorial and includes:

- Defective lower esophageal sphincter (LES); in the normal state, the LES prevents reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus
- Hiatal hernia
- Impaired esophageal peristalsis
- Delayed gastric emptying
- Excessive gastric acid production
- Bile reflux

The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial, and determining the primary etiology can be challenging. The abnormalities that contribute to GERD can result from various components in the system, including the esophagus, LES and the stomach. Poor esophageal motility may decrease the clearance of acidic material. A dysfunctional LES valve can permit reflux of gastric content. As well, delayed gastric emptying can increase both the volume and pressure in the stomach, overwhelming the LES valve and leading to GERD. A hiatal hernia (herniation of the stomach above the diaphragm) can also be viewed as part of the GERD continuum, presenting in patients with severe erosive esophagitis. Therefore, therapy should consider the components that may be deficient, to apply effective treatment.​[[9]](#DeVriesDRVanHerwaardenMASmoutAJSams-EC857500)​[[10]](#PandolfinoJEShiGTrueworthyBKahrilas-EC857AE1)

GERD symptoms may be exacerbated when a patient bends over, lies down, smokes, has obesity, eats certain foods (fatty meals) or takes certain medications (see [Table 2](#psc1033n00011)). GERD may also result in structural damage to the esophagus, and the resulting esophagitis can lead to complications such as ulcers, erosions, hemorrhage, strictures, Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Barrett esophagus involves the replacement of the normal esophageal squamous epithelium with columnar intestinal-like epithelium. Studies estimate the annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma among patients with Barrett esophagus to be 0.1–2.9%.​[[11]](#refitem-127219-9D8CA8C4)​[[12]](#Hvid-JensenFPedersenLDrewesAMSorens-EC85B58F) Severity of GERD symptoms is not always related to the severity of structural esophageal damage. In healthy individuals, a certain amount of normal acid-reflux does occur. However, with further refluxate exposure, the esophagus becomes more vulnerable to damage. Endoscopic evaluations may be recommended where further characterization of possible esophageal damage may be considered.​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623)​[[10]](#PandolfinoJEShiGTrueworthyBKahrilas-EC857AE1)

For further discussion of GERD, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

**Table 2:** GERD: Triggers or Exacerbating Factors

| Disease states | Asthma (possibly) Sjögren syndrome |
| Drugs (reduce lower esophageal sphincter pressure) | Alpha-blockers Anticholinergics Benzodiazepines Beta-agonists Calcium channel blockers Nicotine Nitrates Opioids Theophylline |
| Lifestyle | Obesity Smoking​ [a] Diet Fatty foods delay gastric emptying Chocolate,​ [a] coffee​ [a] and alcohol​ [a] may reduce lower esophageal sphincter tone Carbonated drinks may cause gastric distention and increased transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations |
| Other Factors | Age >65 y Hiatus hernia Pregnancy Stress and anxiety |

[a] Association with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is weak but some patients may experience worsening symptoms.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce or eliminate symptoms
- Reduce or prevent recurrence of symptoms (frequency or duration)
- Induce healing of any damaged mucosa
- Prevent complications such as Barrett esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma
- Educate patients to recognize worsening symptoms of GERD

### Patient Assessment

For uninvestigated dyspepsia, patient assessment should start with a review of alarm features (see [Table 3](#psc1033n00012)), symptoms and history. Patients would require prompt investigation and assessment if alarm features are present or if they are >50 years of age with new onset or worsening of symptom severity or frequency (see [Figure 1](#psc1033n00013)).

In patients with GERD, a similar initial assessment should review the presence of alarm features (see [Table 3](#psc1033n00012)) and symptoms (see [Figure 1](#psc1033n00013)).​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623) If GERD is not evaluated and treated in a timely manner, complications may arise. These complications include esophageal inflammation, ulcers, hemorrhage, strictures and cancer as well as anemia, aspiration pneumonia, gingivitis, halitosis and tooth decay.

**Table 3:** Assessment of Dyspepsia and GERD: Alarm Symptoms​[[1]](#refitem-1272118-A4E27AAF)[[4]](#psc1033n1008)[[5]](#psc1033n1001)

| Further evaluation is required immediately if the patient experiences any of the following symptoms: |
| Symptom | Description |
| Abdominal mass | Abnormal growth or swelling in abdomen |
| Anemia | Dizziness, fatigue, pale appearance, cold extremities |
| Chest pain | Resembling cardiac pain |
| Choking | Sensation of acid refluxed into the windpipe causing shortness of breath, coughing or hoarseness |
| Dysphagia | Difficulty swallowing |
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Vomiting blood or having tarry or black bowel movements |
| Odynophagia | Pain upon swallowing |
| Unintentional weight loss |  |
| Vomiting |  |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Evidence for lifestyle modifications has been inconclusive but, in the absence of alarm features, the initial management of mild or intermittent dyspepsia and GERD should include diet and lifestyle modifications. Some recommendations are provided in [Table 4](#psc1033n00016) and [Table 5](#psc1033n00017). These likely have their greatest impact in patients with mild symptoms.​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623)​[[13]](#psc1033n1012)

**Table 4:** Preventive and Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Dyspepsia​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623)[[16]](#psc1033n1014)

| Lifestyle modifications | Avoid foods that precipitate events Avoid lying down right after meals Reduce body weight if BMI>30 kg/m​ 2 or recent weight gain Quit smoking Avoid alcohol intake Avoid caffeine intake Eat smaller, more frequent meals |
| Psychological | Reassure patients regarding the benign nature of functional dyspepsia Stress reduction |

**Table 5:** Lifestyle Modifications in the Treatment of GERD​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)[[16]](#psc1033n1014)

| Avoid exercising or bending on a full stomach | Avoid tight-fitting clothes around the waist |
| Avoid foods that delay gastric emptying or increase acid exposure: chocolate, onions, carminatives (spearmint, peppermint), high-fat meals | Elevate head of bed about 10 cm |
| Avoid large meals | Avoid alcohol consumption |
| Limit use of drugs that may cause or worsen dyspepsia (e.g., antibiotics, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, iron, metformin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, potassium salts) | Stop smoking if a smoker |
| Avoid lying down following meals, or eating before bedtime | Achieve ideal body weight if obese |

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antacid, Antiflatulent and Antireflux.

Patients with minor or intermittent symptoms of dyspepsia or GERD may use an alginic acid, antacid, histamine type 2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for symptomatic therapy (see [Figure 1](#psc1033n00013) and [Table 6](#d2e1384)).

Patients with dyspepsia should be considered for Helicobacter pylori test-and-treat strategy (see [Figure 1](#psc1033n00013)).​[[1]](#refitem-1272118-A4E27AAF)​[[5]](#psc1033n1001) The test-and-treat strategy works on the principle that 1) some patients with dyspepsia not yet investigated with an endoscope will test positive for H. pylori infection, 2) patients who are H. pylori positive are more likely to have definite ulcers and 3) treatment of H. pylori in patients with ulcers is likely to lead to remission of dyspeptic symptoms. Patients who have ongoing symptoms despite a test-and-treat strategy and a trial of PPIs likely have functional dyspepsia. The majority of trials have demonstrated that most of the available pharmacologic agents for functional dyspepsia are of no proven benefit. The natural history of functional dyspepsia is such that the majority of patients improve without therapy.​[[5]](#psc1033n1001) Despite this, almost all patients with functional dyspepsia who seek medical help will be prescribed a drug. However, only a minority of patients require continuous chronic therapy with medications (PPIs, prokinetic agents, H2RAs) and a significant portion will have difficulty achieving complete symptom relief.​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[5]](#psc1033n1001) Step-up therapy (starting with antacids) has similar efficacy to step-down therapy (starting with PPIs) but treatment cost may be lower for step-up.​[[13]](#psc1033n1012)

### Alginic Acid

Alginic acid, or sodium alginate, forms a physical layer on top of the gastric contents. The rationale is for the alginate layer to be preferentially refluxed into the esophagus over other gastric contents, thereby decreasing exposure of the esophagus to acid and bile. Evidence of this agent's ability to prevent or reverse esophageal injury is lacking; however, combining an alginate with an antacid may reduce some symptoms of endoscopic-negative reflux disease.​[[14]](#refitem-1272116-9D8E0AF8)

### Antacids

Little evidence supports the efficacy of antacids in functional dyspepsia despite their widespread use.​[[5]](#psc1033n1001) In GERD, relief of heartburn occurs in approximately 20% of patients and the esophagus is protected from gastric contents for roughly 1.5 hours. Antacids do provide therapeutic benefits in PUD but their inconvenience (frequent dosing, volume) and taste of suspensions makes other acid suppression therapy more attractive. Four basic types of antacids are available: sodium bicarbonate, and salts of aluminum, calcium and magnesium. The order of acid-neutralizing potency is aluminum hydroxide (least potent), followed by magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate (most potent). Some products contain a combination of salts, especially aluminum and magnesium. The rationale for the aluminum-magnesium combination is to offset the tendency of the respective agents to cause constipation and diarrhea. [Table 6](#d2e1384) provides an overview of the different products and precautions with each agent.​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[8]](#refitem-127214-A4453623)​[[14]](#refitem-1272116-9D8E0AF8)​[[15]](#psc1033n1016)

Dosing equivalency amongst antacids is based upon their ability to neutralize a molar amount of acid, which is called the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). Doses of 10–40 mEq ANC are commonly recommended for functional dyspepsia in adults. GERD usually requires doses ranging from 80–160 mEq ANC. ANCs are dependent on the formulation and quantity of each antacid. Doses are therefore individual to each preparation. Because ANCs are not provided in Canadian labelling information or product monographs, antacid doses are often based on manufacturers' recommendations. The most common dose is 10–20 mL or 2–4 tablets after meals and at bedtime, as needed. Doses used in GERD are higher, e.g., 30 mL 1 hour after meals and at bedtime.

Antacids are available in a variety of formulations. If the patient can tolerate the taste, suspensions are preferred over solid dosage forms since suspensions have a greater ANC (owing to their smaller particle size).​[[15]](#psc1033n1016) Some tablet formulations overcome this by incorporating more of the active ingredient per dose. Other factors to consider in product selection include concomitant clinical conditions and cost. Sodium content is an important consideration in salt-sensitive patients. Fortunately, most products have a low sodium content.

Although antacids appear to be of limited to no benefit in NUD, adequate doses (based on ANC of agent) can raise the gastric pH sufficiently to prevent pepsin activation. Pepsin is an enzyme that begins the digestion of proteins in the stomach and contributes to the stomach acid that regurgitates into the esophagus.​[[16]](#psc1033n1014) Antacids maintain an increased stomach pH only while they are in the stomach, so the duration of effect is dependent on the gastric emptying time. After a large meal, the duration of effect may be 1–3 hours. On an empty stomach, it may be less than 1 hour.​[[16]](#psc1033n1014) If the dose of antacid neutralizes 90% of stomach acid, the pH rises only one full point, e.g., pH 1.3–2.3.​[[15]](#psc1033n1016) Despite the lack of evidence, many clinicians feel that antacids may resolve some dyspeptic symptoms (e.g., heartburn) related to the presence of acid in the stomach.​[[15]](#psc1033n1016) The LES pressure may also increase with the use of antacids, likely due to increased gastric pH.​[[16]](#psc1033n1014) Placebo-controlled trials provide limited data to support the role of antacids.​[[16]](#psc1033n1014)

Sodium **bicarbonate** is suitable only for occasional use because of its high sodium content. It should be avoided in hypertension, heart failure, renal dysfunction, edema, cirrhosis, pregnancy and other situations where excess sodium intake may be harmful. Adverse effects include flatulence, belching and abdominal distention. Sodium bicarbonate can also cause metabolic alkalosis, which may become significant in patients with renal dysfunction, or with high doses or prolonged use.

Calcium **carbonate** is generally the preferred agent in patients with compromised renal function as these patients often have hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with compromised renal function are predisposed to developing the milk-alkali syndrome. This rare syndrome refers to the development of hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis and renal insufficiency with oral intake of more than 2–2.5 g/day of elemental calcium with absorbable alkali. This can result from ingesting calcium as an antacid (e.g., calcium carbonate) or from the combination of other antacids with calcium from another source such as milk. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness and altered mental status. Chronic ingestion of calcium carbonate may cause hypophosphatemia in predisposed patients; e.g., those with poor dietary intake of phosphates, such as malnourished alcoholics. Characteristic features of hypophosphatemia include muscle weakness, tiredness and, in its most severe form, breathing difficulties and heart failure.

**Magnesium-based antacids** should be avoided in renal failure and limited in the elderly due to the risk of hypermagnesemia. Signs of magnesium toxicity include nausea and vomiting, flushing, drowsiness and muscle weakness.

### Histamine H2-receptor Antagonists

H2RAs (cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine and ranitidine) reduce gastric acid by blocking histamine receptors, which reversibly inhibit the action of the proton pump and prevents the movement of hydrogen ions into the stomach. All the H2RAs are considered to be equally effective and to have an excellent safety profile. The relief of GERD symptoms with H2RAs appears similar to antacids but the duration of effect is longer. H2RAs effectively suppress nocturnal acid secretion and have been shown to decrease the frequency of nighttime awakenings for GERD. Bedtime dosing of H2RAs may improve nocturnal reflux as an adjunct to daytime PPI therapy. H2RAs may become less effective with time and may not suppress meal-related acid secretion as well as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).​[[5]](#psc1033n1001)​[[14]](#refitem-1272116-9D8E0AF8) Their rapid onset of action makes them attractive for “on-demand” use by some patients with mild GERD (mild symptoms <3 times/week).​[[17]](#2008Mainie18496394) Empiric therapy with an H2RA for 4–8 weeks may be beneficial to treat the symptoms of functional dyspepsia.

### Proton Pump Inhibitors

PPIs (dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole **magnesium**, **pantoprazole** **sodium** and rabeprazole) effectively block acid secretion by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the proton pump. At equivalent doses, available PPIs offer similar symptom relief, mucosal healing, tolerability and safety. PPIs are more effective than H2RAs and provide more rapid relief of symptoms. Studies have demonstrated that PPIs decrease the overall days of symptoms of GERD and dyspepsia, as well as nighttime symptoms.​[[4]](#psc1033n1008) Patients with moderate to severe or frequent symptoms of GERD (occurring >2 times per week) can be treated with an 8-week course of PPIs,​[[1]](#refitem-1272118-A4E27AAF)​[[3]](#psc1033n1003)​[[18]](#refitem-1272112-9D8CF347) and empiric therapy with a PPI for 4–8 weeks may be used to treat the symptoms of functional dyspepsia.​[[1]](#refitem-1272118-A4E27AAF)​[[19]](#2017PintoSanchezCD011194)

PPIs are prodrugs requiring proton pump activation for optimal efficacy; they are best administered 30 minutes before a meal, ideally once a day before breakfast. The long-term use of PPIs has been associated with potentially serious adverse effects which must be weighed against the benefits of therapy.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

See Prenatal and Postpartum Care and Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Further investigation is required for patients with symptoms that persist for >2 weeks, in those with worsening symptoms, when symptoms are incompletely relieved by antacids, H2RAs and PPIs, and when symptoms recur a number of times per year. Due to the variability of GERD and dyspeptic symptomologies, clinical judgment is required in conducting follow-up care. This should be based on the individual patient's symptoms and response to treatments. Follow-up on days 2 and 7 of therapy would be reasonable to ensure that the medication is effective and that the patient is experiencing no adverse side effects. Patients should monitor their symptoms and response to treatments on a regular basis, and keep track of factors that may exacerbate their symptoms.

### Advice for the Patient

Advise patients on:

- Nonpharmacologic interventions
- Expected side effects and their management
- Seeing a health-care practitioner if the condition lasts >2 weeks or if alarm features appear
