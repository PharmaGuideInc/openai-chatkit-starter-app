### Pathophysiology

The development of cold sores is primarily related to 2 herpes simplex viruses (HSVs): herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex-2 (HSV-2). HSV-1, which is most commonly transmitted via saliva, causes the majority of oral herpes infections; HSV-2, which is present in genital secretions, causes the majority of genital herpes infections.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) However, orogenital contact may cause a primary infection of either type in either the oral or genital region.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause primary or recurrent infections. When symptomatic, and involving the oral region, a first infection is known as primary herpes gingivostomatitis. Although not inevitable, 20–40% of patients who experience a primary herpes infection develop subsequent recurrent herpes infections caused by reactivation of HSV that remains latent in neural ganglion cells.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) Recurrences in the oral region most commonly affect the vermilion border of the lips and are known as herpes labialis, cold sores or fever blisters​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[3]](#psc1192n1003) ([see Photo, Cold Sore](#psc1192n01086)). Less commonly, recurrences appear on the hard palate, chin or oral mucosa.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Primary HSV-1 infection occurs in approximately one-third of school-aged children​[[4]](#psc1192n1004) and serological evidence of HSV-1 infection is evident in up to 80% of adolescents and adults.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) Babies generally acquire anti-HSV antibodies from their mothers, which protect them from infection until around 6 months of age.​[[3]](#psc1192n1003) HSV-1 can be transmitted by intimate oral-to-oral contact and via contact with the virus in sores, saliva and surfaces in or around the mouth. Transmission may happen through sharing cosmetics, razors, towels or eating utensils with an infected individual. The incidence of infection with HSV-2 increases after sexual activity begins; risk factors include being female, having a history of sexually transmitted disease and having multiple sexual partners.​[[3]](#psc1192n1003)​[[5]](#psc1192n1005)​[[6]](#psc1192n1006)

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce any discomfort, including pain or itching
- Reduce viral shedding
- Reduce duration and severity of the episode
- Prevent secondary bacterial infection
- Prevent recurrences

### Patient Assessment

Primary HSV infections occur in patients who have not been previously infected with HSV (i.e., HSV seronegative); they are frequently subclinical, or cause symptoms difficult to differentiate from upper respiratory tract infections.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[7]](#psc1192n1007)​[[8]](#psc1192n1008) Symptomatic infections may be characterized by malaise, fever, chills, muscle aches, lymphadenopathy, and multiple crops of painful vesicles or blisters and ulcerative erosions on the tongue, palate, gingiva, buccal mucosa, and lips, occurring 1–26 days after inoculation.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) The lesions rupture readily, leaving small ulcers covered with a pseudomembrane and surrounded by erythema.​[[5]](#psc1192n1005) Extensive oral involvement is more common in younger children, while older children, adolescents and adults are more likely to exhibit pharyngitis-like symptoms.​[[9]](#James2010) This primary infection lasts 1–3 weeks without scarring. Constitutional symptoms may last 10–14 days. Oral shedding of the virus may continue for up to 23 days.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[6]](#psc1192n1006) In severe primary episodes, discomfort may interfere with eating and drinking to the point of dehydration. Some patients go on to have recurrent infections, typically 1–6 episodes per year, while others never experience a second episode.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) A first episode in a patient already seropositive for HSV is termed a nonprimary initial infection, and these infections tend to be less severe.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)

Recurrent infections tend to be less severe than primary infections.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) A prodromal tingling, itching or burning sensation in the location of the eruption may occur 2–24 hours before the appearance of the vesicles in 60% of patients.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[5]](#psc1192n1005)​[[6]](#psc1192n1006) The lesion on the lips and perioral area then appears over 1–2 days.​[[6]](#psc1192n1006) Papules on an erythematous base usually become vesicles within hours and then break open, leaking a clear, sticky fluid, and subsequently progress through the stages of ulceration, crusting, and healing over 72–120 hours.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[6]](#psc1192n1006) Time to full healing without scarring may take up to 7–10 days.​[[5]](#psc1192n1005)​[[6]](#psc1192n1006) Generally there are no systemic symptoms, and patients complain only of the unsightly appearance, pain and occasional itching. In a quarter of recurrent cases, the infection heals before blisters or ulcers can form.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)

Patients who are immunosuppressed by disease or drug therapy are at higher risk of recurrences of HSV; this includes those receiving immunosuppressive cancer chemotherapy, drugs to suppress rejection of organ transplantation or biologic drugs, and those infected with HIV. Atopic individuals may develop a rapidly progressing HSV cutaneous infection.

Refer immunocompromised patients or those with frequent, persistent, recurrent or swollen oral lesions to an appropriate health-care practitioner for assessment (see [Figure 1](#psc1192n00001)).

### Prevention

Common stressors that can precipitate recurrences include emotional stress, fatigue, sun exposure (UV light), menstruation and other hormonal changes, fever, hyperthermia, upper respiratory tract infection, dental extraction, and physical trauma or surgery.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[5]](#psc1192n1005)​[[10]](#psc1192n1048)​[[11]](#refitem-1202110-914D31BC) Consider the following preventative measures:

- Reducing stress (e.g., eating well, getting enough sleep and exercise, practicing relaxation techniques) may help prevent recurrences in individuals for whom stress is a known trigger.​[[5]](#psc1192n1005)​[[7]](#psc1192n1007)
- Prophylactic treatment with an antiviral prior to dental procedures may be indicated to prevent a recurrence in patients who report more than one episode per year.​[[12]](#psc1192n1049)
- Protecting affected areas from sun exposure, especially while at the beach and on ski hills, will likely reduce the frequency of cold sore recurrences.​[[6]](#psc1192n1006)​[[7]](#psc1192n1007)​[[13]](#psc1192n1039) A sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher should be applied to the lips and face 30 minutes prior to sun exposure. Prophylactic treatment with oral acyclovir prior to prolonged sun exposure and continued for duration of exposure may prevent sunlight-induced recurrences.​[[14]](#refitem-1202134-85DE0F5F)
- Avoid spread of cold sores to other parts of the body and to other people by frequent hand washing and avoiding skin-to-skin contact with others until after the blister has dried up and crusted over.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Advise patients to keep the lesion clean with gentle washing using mild soap and water. Alternatively, the area can be soaked with cool tap water compresses.​[[15]](#psc1192n1011) Patients should avoid excessive touching of the lesion and should wash their hands frequently to prevent autoinoculation and spread of HSV.

Heat application is a treatment yet to be evaluated through randomized research. Devices in the shape of a lipstick have been marketed for use on areas where prodromal symptoms are felt. It is postulated that the high temperature (50°C) may reduce the severity of symptoms such as burning, blistering, itching and swelling, potentially by blocking replication of the virus.​[[1]](#psc1192n1001)​[[16]](#refitem-1202113-846F455F) More evidence is required before such devices are recommended for the treatment of cold sores.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Oral HSV infections are self-limiting in immunocomptent patients. Analgesics can be recommended for symptom relief, and topical protectants (e.g., allantoin, calamine, cocoa butter, petrolatum, **zinc oxide**) may help prevent cracking and excessive drying of the HSV lesions .​[[17]](#psc1192n1010) Antivirals may be considered for immunocompetent patients to decrease the duration of symptoms. Immunocompromised patients should be referred to an appropriate health-care practitioner for further evaluation. [Table 1](#d2e682) presents medications commonly used to manage cold sores.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products of Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Mouth Products: Cold Sores and Canker Sores; Skin Care Products: Anesthetics, First Aid.

### Analgesics

Systemic analgesics such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen can be recommended at standard analgesic dosages to control moderate to severe pain for a period not exceeding 3 days.

Topical products containing anesthetics such as benzocaine, camphor, lidocaine, menthol, phenol, pramoxine or prilocaine may be useful in relieving mild pain for a relatively short period of time.

### Antivirals

Without antiviral treatment, the expected natural healing time of a cold sore is 7–10 days. The antiviral agents acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir have been studied for the treatment and prophylaxis of cold sores;​[[11]](#refitem-1202110-914D31BC) however, only valacyclovir has an indication from Health Canada for the treatment of cold sores (patients ≥12 y). While not officially indicated for herpes labialis, oral acyclovir is the only antiviral agent approved for use in both adults and children (>2 y). Valacyclovir and famciclovir (prodrugs of acyclovir and penciclovir, respectively) are designed to increase the bioavailability of their active forms.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) These antiviral agents have few toxic effects because they are converted by viral thymidine kinase to active drug only once they are inside virally infected cells;​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) they are well tolerated and have comparable safety profiles.​[[22]](#refitem-1202120-878722CC) Docosanol is a topical treatment that prevents the herpes simplex virus from spreading to healthy cells and provides a small clinical benefit on healing time and patient discomfort.​[[24]](#psc1192n1018)

#### Primary infections

Antiviral therapy is often recommended for moderate to severe, uncomplicated cases of primary oral herpes when patients are experiencing pain, discomfort or dehydration. Treatment is most effective when started as soon as possible, ideally within 72 hours.​[[20]](#psc1192n1026)​[[25]](#Goldman2016) Oral acyclovir decreased the duration of symptoms (e.g. fever, odynophagia, lesions) and viral shedding compared with placebo in a small randomized controlled trial in children.​[[20]](#psc1192n1026) Famciclovir and valacyclovir are reasonable treatment alternatives, although randomized controlled trials are lacking. The treatment duration is typically 7 days, but may be up to 10 days depending on the severity of symptoms and response to treatment.

#### Recurrent infections

Three differing approaches to antiviral treatment for recurrent infections may be used:​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)

- *Intermittent episodic therapy* (IET) is the treatment of isolated, acute episodes of HSV at the first clinical sign or symptom for either a primary or recurrent episode. Evidence supports the use of oral acyclovir, ​[[20]](#psc1192n1026)​[[26]](#psc1192n1030) famciclovir​[[27]](#psc1192n1029)​[[28]](#psc1192n1032) and valacyclovir.​[[29]](#psc1192n1031)​[[30]](#psc1192n1014)​[[31]](#psc1192n1036)​[[32]](#psc1192n1024)​[[33]](#psc1192n1025)​[[34]](#psc1192n1027) Recurrent infections are managed with a short course of high-dose antiviral therapy which should be started as soon as possible in patients with prodromal symptoms,​[[21]](#Gilbert2007) ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) (Providing an advance prescription for an oral antiviral to patients who experience recurrent infections is recommended to allow initiation of therapy immediately at the onset of symptoms.) Acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir have all been shown to decrease time to lesion healing and duration of symptoms by 1–2 days in randomized controlled trials​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[26]](#psc1192n1030)​[[27]](#psc1192n1029)​[[29]](#psc1192n1031) with valacyclovir reducing the time to healing and resolution of pain more effectively than acyclovir.​[[22]](#refitem-1202120-878722CC) Famciclovir and valacyclovir offer greater patient convenience with shorter treatment duration and less frequent dosing compared with acyclovir.

  Topical antivirals (e.g., acyclovir **5% cream**, sometimes in combination with hydrocortisone) appear to be less effective than systemic treatments in reducing time to healing. Also, topical antivirals require frequent application and carry a risk of self-inoculation.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002)​[[22]](#refitem-1202120-878722CC)​[[35]](#psc1192n1033)​[[36]](#psc1192n1034)​[[37]](#psc1192n1035)

  A randomized controlled trial that compared docosanol with placebo (polyethylene glycol) found docosanol achieved healing 17 hours sooner (4.1 days vs. 4.8 days) and stopped discomfort 12 hours faster (2.2 days vs. 2.7 days) when the creams were applied 5 times daily, with the first application within 12 hours of episode onset.​[[24]](#psc1192n1018) Because the time to healing in the placebo group was also significantly lower than the expected natural healing time, the issue of a potential therapeutic effect of the polyethylene glycol vehicle has been raised.​[[38]](#refitem-1202118-9F2BE5B9) Docosanol should be applied 5 times daily at the first sign of pain, itching, burning, redness or tingling.
- *Chronic suppressive therapy* (CST) is not indicated for most patients with HSV infection, but may be appropriate for the 5–10% of patients who experience frequent recurrences (≥6 per year) and who also experience disfigurement, have difficulty swallowing or severe pain, have prolonged episodes, or are particularly distressed.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) Evidence supports the use of low-dose daily oral acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir.​[[14]](#refitem-1202134-85DE0F5F)​[[26]](#psc1192n1030)​[[30]](#psc1192n1014)​[[31]](#psc1192n1036)​[[39]](#refitem-1202133-85DF610A)​[[40]](#2017Leung28971780) Topical therapy is not recommended for use in CST.​[[14]](#refitem-1202134-85DE0F5F)
- *Intermittent suppressive therapy* (IST) is appropriate when recurrences can be anticipated based on known precipitating factors (see [Prevention](#psc1192n00015)), particularly in situations where decreasing viral shedding will decrease the likelihood of infecting seronegative individuals.​[[2]](#psc1192n1002) Specific dosing guidelines are not available for IST, but extrapolation of data from CST studies is thought to be appropriate. Oral acyclovir has been shown to have some effect on preventing sunlight-induced recurrences when started 12 hours prior to sun exposure and continued for duration of exposure. Data for topical acyclovir cream are conflicting (possibly due to poor penetration from site of application).​[[14]](#refitem-1202134-85DE0F5F)​[[41]](#psc1192n1037)​[[42]](#psc1192n1038)​[[43]](#psc1192n1040)​[[44]](#psc1192n1041)

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for use in oral inflammation caused by viruses, as they may mask the spread of infection and suppress the normal immune response. However, their topical use in conjunction with antivirals (e.g., fluocinonide **0.05%**, hydrocortisone **1%**) may be helpful.​[[45]](#psc1192n1021)

### Natural Health Products

There is some evidence that a cream of lemon balm (*Melissa officinalis*) containing 1% of a 70:1 leaf extract applied to the site of a cold sore during the prodromal stage reduces the number and size of lesions, although the overall severity of the outbreak is not lessened.​[[46]](#psc1192n1042)​[[47]](#psc1192n1043) Lemon balm is usually applied 2–4 times daily from first sign of prodrome, ideally within 72 hours of onset, to a few days after the lesions have healed, i.e., 5–10 days.​[[46]](#psc1192n1042)​[[48]](#psc1192n1044)

Lysine, an essential amino acid, is available in oral and topical dosage forms for prevention and treatment of cold sores. Lysine is theorized to compete with arginine, another essential amino acid that is required for viral replication, thereby providing an antiviral effect.​[[49]](#refitem-1202149-88040C4E) Evidence regarding the effectiveness of lysine for this indication varies, with some studies indicating efficacy is dose-dependent.​[[8]](#psc1192n1008)​[[50]](#psc1192n1045)​[[51]](#psc1192n1046)

Bee products such as honey and propolis have been studied for their anti-inflammatory, anti-infective and antioxidant effects.​[[52]](#Pasupuleti2017)​[[53]](#Martinello2021) A meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of bee products with topical acyclovir in the treatment of cold sores found similar healing time and pain reduction;​[[54]](#Rocha2022) however, the available studies were of low quality and preparations and dosage regimens varied.

### Other Therapies

Topical application of zinc preparations has been reported to benefit patients with cold sores and may improve time to healing when applied as soon as possible after symptom onset.​[[49]](#refitem-1202149-88040C4E) The risk of skin irritation may be increased.​[[55]](#refitem-1202149-88007220) Given the lack of standardized frequency and concentration, the variety of zinc salts used in trials, and the lack of high-quality data, further information is required.

Limited evidence suggests that oral zinc **sulfate** (up to 50 mg/day) may reduce the occurrence of cold sores as well as the duration of lesions during an episode when administered for a 3–4 month treatment period.​[[8]](#psc1192n1008)​[[49]](#refitem-1202149-88040C4E) However, the potential for copper deficiency with long-term zinc use and lack of quality data should be noted.

There is no published evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of heparin in the treatment of cold sores, although it is an ingredient in frequently recommended products.

Caustic substances such as **silver nitrate** may create further damage and should not be applied to cold sores.

Highly astringent topical ingredients such as **tannic acid** are not recommended for treatment of cold sores. They have the potential to cause excessive drying of the area with resultant fissuring, discomfort and potential bacterial superinfection.​[[15]](#psc1192n1011)​[[17]](#psc1192n1010)

### Monitoring of Therapy

Cold sores are expected to resolve within 2 weeks. Further evaluation is indicated if nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments do not relieve the discomfort, the lesions spread, or the patient develops symptoms of systemic illness (e.g., fever, malaise, swollen glands). If application of a product containing a local anesthetic causes increased erythema and edema in the area of the lesion, contact dermatitis should be suspected and the product discontinued.
