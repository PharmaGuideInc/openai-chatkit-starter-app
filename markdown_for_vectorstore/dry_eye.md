### Pathophysiology

### Anatomy/Physiology

The lacrimal functional unit is composed of the lacrimal glands, the ocular surface (cornea and conjunctiva), meibomian glands, eyelids, and the sensory and motor nerves that connect them. This unit controls the production of the tear film and responds to environmental, endocrine and neurological influences in order to maintain the tear film, the transparency of the cornea and the quality of the image projected onto the retina.

The tear film is composed of 3 layers:

- The mucous layer is the layer closest to the eye and contains multiple mucins produced by goblet cells in the conjunctiva. It acts as a lubricant between the eyelids and the globe. It also traps and removes waste materials such as shed epithelial cells, debris and microorganisms.
- The aqueous layer is the thickest part of the tear film and is produced by the lacrimal glands. It contains inorganic salts, glucose, urea, trace elements, antibacterial proteins (including lactoferrin and lysozyme), vitamins (particularly vitamin A) and growth factors. This layer hydrates the mucous layer, supplies oxygen and electrolytes to the ocular surface, and provides antibacterial defense and wound healing.
- The lipid layer is primarily secreted by the meibomian glands and is the outermost layer of the tear film. It enhances tear film spreading, provides a smooth optical surface, and plays a significant role in stabilizing the tear film.

Although this is the classic description of the tear film, the mucous and aqueous layers are better described as a mucoaqueous subphase, where the mucin concentration is highest at the epithelial cell surface (the eye) and lowest as it comes in contact with the air.​[[1]](#psc1016n1007)​[[2]](#psc1016n01054)​[[3]](#BronAJDePaivaCSChauhanSKEtAl.TFOSDE-B1BDBDE5)

### Dry Eye Disease

The Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) redefined dry eye disease (DED) as “a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface, characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles.”​[[4]](#CraigJPNicholsKKAkpekEKEtAl.TFOSDEW-B1BDF73C)

DED has 2 major classifications: aqueous tear-deficient dry eye (see [Table 1](#psc1016n01040)) and evaporative dry eye (see [Table 2](#psc1016n01043)). However, there can be considerable overlap between the 2, and DED may involve multiple mechanisms.​[[1]](#psc1016n1007)​[[3]](#BronAJDePaivaCSChauhanSKEtAl.TFOSDE-B1BDBDE5)​[[5]](#psc1016n1004)​[[8]](#psc1016n1003) For example, contact lens wearers may experience decreased corneal sensitivity with reflex sensory block, leading to aqueous deficiency. They may also blink less frequently and/or have incomplete lid closure during blinking, leading to premature tear evaporation and low tear breakup time (TBUT) in between blinks. If the patient is also taking a medication with anticholinergic side effects, tear secretion may be decreased further.​[[9]](#psc1016n1016)

Regardless of the mechanism(s) for the development of DED, the impact on a patient's quality of life can be significant. Severe DED may result in ocular surface erosions, epithelial damage and, rarely, ocular surface keratinization, ulceration, perforation, scarring and markedly reduced vision.​[[1]](#psc1016n1007)​[[3]](#BronAJDePaivaCSChauhanSKEtAl.TFOSDE-B1BDBDE5)​[[10]](#psc1016n1001)​[[11]](#psc1016n1015)

**Table 1:** Classification of Aqueous Tear-Deficient Dry Eye

| Non-Sjögren ​ [1] ​ [3] ​ [5] | Lacrimal gland deficiency | Primary: Age-related, congenital alacrima, familial dysautonomia |
| Secondary: Lacrimal gland infiltration, e.g., in sarcoidosis, lymphoma, AIDS, hepatitis C; lacrimal gland ablation; lacrimal gland denervation |
| Lacrimal duct obstruction | Trachoma, cicatricial pemphigoid, mucous membrane pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, chemical injury, graft-versus-host disease |
| Reflex hyposecretion | Sensory block: Secondary to factors that decrease corneal sensation including refractive surgery, trigeminal nerve injury, contact lens wear, diabetes mellitus, neurotrophic keratitis |
| Motor block: Parasympathetic damage, systemic medication use |
| Sjögren ​ [6] ​ [7] | Primary | Autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands; affects approximately 10% of patients with aqueous deficient dry eye |
| Secondary | Associated with other autoimmune diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus |

**Table 2:** Classification of Evaporative Dry Eye​[[1]](#psc1016n1007)[[3]](#BronAJDePaivaCSChauhanSKEtAl.TFOSDE-B1BDBDE5)[[5]](#psc1016n1004)

| Lid-related | Meibomian gland dysfunction : May be associated with dermatoses such as acne rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis; age-related |
| Medications : Isotretinoin therapy |
| Disorders of lid aperture : Exophthalmos (hyperthyroidism, eyelid deformity, poor lid apposition), contact lens wear |
| Low blink rate : Parkinson disease |
| Ocular surface-related | Decreased blink rate : Tends to occur during activities such as reading, watching television, computer work |
| Ocular surface abnormalities : Vitamin A deficiency; exposure to eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride or anesthetic agents |
| Allergic conjunctivitis |

In all severities, an individual with DED can experience disturbances in the activities of daily living such as reading, driving, using a computer and watching television, thus negatively impacting that person’s quality of life and occupational function.​[[12]](#MiljanovicBDanaRSullivanDAEtAl.Impa-989BFCD8) A meta-analysis found that individuals with DED had an increased prevalence of depression (OR = 2.92) and anxiety (OR = 2.8) compared with those who did not have DED. Through subgroup analysis, this study also found that depression and anxiety were more severe in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome.​[[13]](#WanKHChenLJYoungAL.DepressionAndAnx-989C68F1) Although the causal relationship between DED and these psychiatric comorbidities is not yet established, practitioners should be aware of this association and need to be cautious when selecting treatment options for psychiatric conditions, as antidepressants may exacerbate DED through their anticholinergic effects. It may not be practical to screen all patients with DED for psychiatric comorbidities, but screening should occur in those with primary Sjögren syndrome or those with DED whose subjective symptoms appear to be more severe than objective signs would suggest. See Anxiety Disorders and Depression for more information on screening tools.

Patients who have damage to the ocular surface may not complain of symptoms, while others who are highly symptomatic may not demonstrate clinical evidence of DED.​[[1]](#psc1016n1007)​[[3]](#BronAJDePaivaCSChauhanSKEtAl.TFOSDE-B1BDBDE5)​[[5]](#psc1016n1004) For example, patients with fibromyalgia or other centralized chronic pain syndromes may report several symptoms of DED, despite normal findings on ophthalmologic examination.​[[14]](#ShteinRMHarperDEPallazolaVEtAl.Disc-B1BFA946)

See [Table 3](#B1C1901C) for a list of risk factors for DED.

**Table 3:** Risk Factors for Dry Eye Disease​[[15]](#StapletonFAlvesMBunyaVYEtAl.TFOSDEW-B1C23512)

### Goals of Therapy

- Ease patient discomfort and minimize symptoms, while addressing the root cause(s) of DED
- Prevent or delay complications
- Educate patients about their condition and encourage adherence, especially in those with long-term disease

### Patient Assessment

An algorithm for the assessment of eye conditions is presented in Assessment of Patients with Eye Conditions.

Patients with DED may complain of a foreign body sensation in the eye.​[[5]](#psc1016n1004)​[[16]](#WolffsohnJSAritaRChalmersREtAl.TFOS-B8D6F288) Words like “sandy” or “scratchy” are used to convey this symptom. Eyes often feel like they are burning, itchy or tired. Other symptoms include photophobia, blurred vision, redness, discomfort and difficulty in moving the lids. Symptoms are usually present in both eyes.

Although most patients state that their eyes feel dry, some will report increased tearing, especially when exposed to wind or when concentrating on tasks such as reading or computer work.​[[5]](#psc1016n1004)​[[16]](#WolffsohnJSAritaRChalmersREtAl.TFOS-B8D6F288) This is a reflex tearing that does little to increase comfort and illustrates that DED involves compromised tear film quality, not quantity.

Unlike blepharitis and conjunctivitis, dry eye symptoms tend to worsen over the course of the day.​[[5]](#psc1016n1004)​[[16]](#WolffsohnJSAritaRChalmersREtAl.TFOS-B8D6F288)

Patient-reported outcome questionnaires are available for the assessment of DED; two tools recommended for use are the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ-5).​[[16]](#WolffsohnJSAritaRChalmersREtAl.TFOS-B8D6F288) Objective tests to confirm DED are performed by an eye-care professional and include noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT) and fluorescein tear breakup time (FBUT) or, if NIBUT is unavailable, ocular surface staining or tear osmolarity measurement.

### Prevention

Many systemic medications and herbal products have the potential to cause DED (see [Table 4](#B1C4DFDE)). Changing to another medication or using the lowest effective dose may decrease this risk.​[[24]](#GomesJAPAzarDTBaudouinCEtAl.TFOSDEW-B1C48CDB)

Frequent use of eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride as a preservative may contribute to DED by further damaging the ocular surface.​[[25]](#psc1016n1011)​[[26]](#psc1016n1013)​[[27]](#psc1016n1017) Advise patients of this potential effect and provide treatment options in case it occurs (see [Table 6](#B23711CA)).

It is common to blink less frequently and/or have incomplete lid closure during activities requiring concentration such as reading, computer work and video games; remind patients to blink more often during these activities. Contact lens users need to be attentive to proper cleaning and wear of their lenses (see Contact Lens Care). Encourage patients with chronic blepharitis to maintain lid hygiene. Ask patients with autoimmune or dermatologic diseases (e.g., Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, acne rosacea) about any symptoms of dry eye. Because of the severity of DED that has been associated with these diseases, referral to an eye-care practitioner may be suggested to optimize therapy and prevent complications.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy of mild-moderate DED mainly involves altering environmental and lifestyle factors to increase quality and quantity of tear film; for more information, see [Table 5](#B233B7F8).

**Table 5:** Nonpharmacologic Therapy for Dry Eye Disease​[[6]](#psc1016n1008)[[7]](#AkpekEKAmescuaGFaridMEtAl.DryEyeSyn-3C2CEF22)[[10]](#psc1016n1001)[[19]](#psc1016n1010)[[28]](#psc1016n1002)[[29]](#CraigJPNelsonJDAzarDTEtAl.TFOSDEWSI-B234BACA)[[30]](#ClaytonJA.DryEye.NEngJMed2018375221-B234C072)

| Environmental | Avoid smoking or staying in smoky rooms Avoid air drafts (e.g., ceiling fans) Wear sunglasses when outdoors Use humidifiers Use moisture chamber glasses Wear ski or swim goggles (± moistened gauze) Use cool, moist compresses for temporary relief |
| Lifestyle | Screen time: decrease screen time; take regular breaks; lower computer screen to below eye level; make a conscious effort to blink more often Increase fluid intake Increase sleep |
| Punctal occlusion | Punctal plugs Temporary—usually collagen-based; absorb in 1–16 weeks Permanent—usually silicone-based Heat or electrocautery (permanent) |

In severe or chronic DED, tear duct (punctal) occlusion may be used to prevent drainage of existing tears via the nasolacrimal ducts.​[[21]](#psc1016n1020)​[[28]](#psc1016n1002)​[[31]](#ErvinAMLawAPuckerAD.PunctalOcclusio-3C3291D7)​[[32]](#psc1016n1022)​[[33]](#psc1016n1023)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7) Punctal plugs, inserted by an eye-care practitioner trained in this technique, are used to assess whether a patient will benefit from this treatment. It is possible to dislodge the plugs, especially if patients rub their eyelids. Therefore, nasolacrimal occlusion for eye drop instillation is not recommended or required in patients with punctal plugs. Permanent occlusion can be achieved through heat or electrocautery but can also occur spontaneously following insertion of punctal plugs, and can persist even after the plugs are lost.​[[35]](#psc1016n1024)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Ophthalmic Products: Ocular Lubricants.

Pharmacologic therapy generally begins with administration of ocular lubricants. Also referred to as artificial tears, these are used to replace and/or supplement the natural tear film.​[[28]](#psc1016n1002)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7) Although they can relieve symptoms of DED, they do not target the underlying pathology.​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)​[[36]](#PuckerADNgSMNicholsJJ.OverTheCounte-FAF91F55)

All ocular lubricants are composed of an aqueous base but differ in other ingredients and properties (see [Table 6](#B23711CA) and [Table 7](#B242CDC9)). Clinical trials do not provide definitive conclusions about which lubricant is best because of the difficulty in meeting primary efficacy endpoints. Much of the information relating to pharmacologic treatments is proprietary, and large, head-to-head clinical trials are lacking.​[[36]](#PuckerADNgSMNicholsJJ.OverTheCounte-FAF91F55) Until more evidence is available, choosing the best therapy is achieved through a trial-and-error approach.​[[2]](#psc1016n01054)​[[21]](#psc1016n1020)​[[22]](#psc1016n1021)​[[28]](#psc1016n1002)​[[33]](#psc1016n1023)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)​[[37]](#psc1016n01053)​[[38]](#psc1016n1025) This can be frustrating, both for the patient and for the health-care practitioner. In mild to moderate DED, a trial of several weeks is needed to determine the subjective efficacy of an ocular lubricant (patient comfort, improvement in symptoms).

Advise patients who require the use of ocular lubricants more than 4 times a day to use a preservative-free product to avoid any negative effects produced by the preservative.​[[7]](#AkpekEKAmescuaGFaridMEtAl.DryEyeSyn-3C2CEF22)

**Table 6:** Properties of Ocular Lubricants​[[21]](#psc1016n1020)[[22]](#psc1016n1021)[[25]](#psc1016n1011)[[28]](#psc1016n1002)[[33]](#psc1016n1023)[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)[[39]](#psc1016n1027)[[40]](#psc1016n1028)[[41]](#psc1016n1029)[[42]](#WillcoxMDPArguesoPGeorgievGAEtAl.TF-C850DD5C)

| Property | Comments | Examples |
| Viscosity | Although several viscosity agents are available, there is no evidence to inform if one is more effective than the others.​ [34] Higher viscosity agents (e.g., petrolatum ointments, carboxymethylcellulose 1%) increase tear retention time on the ocular surface but may cause more visual disturbance than lower viscosity agents. | Carbomer 940 (polyacrylic acid) Carboxymethylcellulose Dextran Hyaluronic acid Hydroxypropyl-guar (HP-guar) Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose Petrolatum Polyethylene glycol Polyvinyl alcohol Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (povidone) |
| Osmolarity | Hypo-osmolar tear substitutes may counteract the increased tear osmolarity found in DED. | Ocular lubricants with osmolarity <308 mOsm/L are considered hypo-osmolar. |
| Electrolytes | Adding electrolytes to ocular lubricants may better mimic natural tears. In natural tears, potassium helps to maintain corneal thickness while bicarbonate aids in the recovery of epithelial barrier function. | Calcium chloride Magnesium chloride Potassium chloride Sodium bicarbonate Sodium chloride |
| Lipids | To replace low lipid levels and prevent tear evaporation. | Dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) Castor oil Mineral oil |
| Preservatives | Benzalkonium chloride, known to be toxic to the epithelium. Limit use to 4 applications/day or use the following alternatives: Lubricants with other less toxic preservatives (see examples) Unit dose lubricants Multi-dose bottles with filter/valve to maintain sterility (no preservatives included) Ointments, which do not support bacterial growth and do not require preservatives. However, these can produce unacceptable blurred vision | Cetrimide Polyquaternium-1 (Polyquad) Sodium chlorite (Purite) Sodium perborate (GenAqua) |

Ophthalmic corticosteroids may be used for short-term treatment of moderate to severe DED.​[[30]](#ClaytonJA.DryEye.NEngJMed2018375221-B234C072)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)​[[44]](#psc1016n1034)​[[45]](#FoulksGNForstotSLDonshikPCEtAl.Clin-B8E44A93) Fluorometholone and loteprednol ophthalmic solutions, used for 2–4 week periods as pulse therapy, improve DED signs and symptoms by reducing ocular surface inflammation. Short-term use is recommended to minimize adverse effects associated with long-term use of ophthalmic corticosteroids (e.g., glaucoma, cataract, infection).

Ophthalmic cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor that interferes with T-cell function and reduces inflammation, can be used for the long-term treatment of moderate to severe DED.​[[30]](#ClaytonJA.DryEye.NEngJMed2018375221-B234C072)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)​[[45]](#FoulksGNForstotSLDonshikPCEtAl.Clin-B8E44A93)​[[46]](#DeveneyTAsbellPA.PatientAndPhysicia-B8E6A5B5) Cyclosporine ophthalmic solution commonly causes stinging upon instillation; a 2-week course of loteprednol prior to initiation of cyclosporine has been shown to decrease this adverse effect.

Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 antagonist, approved for the treatment of moderate-severe DED.​[[30]](#ClaytonJA.DryEye.NEngJMed2018375221-B234C072)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7) Lifitegrast inhibits T-cell migration into target tissues, leading to a reduction in inflammation.

For more information on ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medications, see [Table 7](#B242CDC9).

Autologous serum eye drops have been used to treat DED.​[[47]](#HussainMShteinRMSugarAEtAl.Long-ter-A3F1B542)​[[48]](#CelebiARUlusoyCMirzaGE.TheEfficacyO-A3F1D88B) They contain biologically active substances required to maintain the tear film, which are believed to be a better substitute than artificial tears. Concerns about autologous serum eye drops include the risk of microbial growth in the protein-rich product and the risks associated with periodic patient blood draws. The optimal concentration and diluent are also unknown. A Cochrane review reported insufficient evidence to prove the safety and efficacy of autologous serum eye drops for the treatment of DED; high-quality randomized control trials are required.​[[49]](#PanQAngelinaAZambranoAMarroneMStark-A3EF3983)

Other treatments that have been investigated for severe dry eye include topical acetylcysteine​[[10]](#psc1016n1001)​[[25]](#psc1016n1011)​[[28]](#psc1016n1002) (removes excessive mucus), topical estradiol​[[50]](#psc1016n1035) and periorbital intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (used for essential blepharospasm).​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7)​[[51]](#psc1016n1036) Oral pilocarpine may be required for the treatment of dry eye associated with Sjögren syndrome.​[[45]](#FoulksGNForstotSLDonshikPCEtAl.Clin-B8E44A93)​[[52]](#psc1016n1033)

Omega-3 fatty acids are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce the inflammatory component of DED.​[[53]](#psc1016n01055)​[[54]](#psc1016n01056) Several preliminary studies have demonstrated that patients with meibomian gland dysfunction associated–DED may benefit from omega-3 fatty acid–rich foods or supplementation.​[[55]](#psc1016n1030)​[[56]](#psc1016n1031)​[[57]](#AlMahmoodAMAl-SwailemSA.EssentialFa-A3EE79F0)​[[58]](#BhargavaRKumarPKumarMMehraNMishraA.-A3ED3B1C)​[[59]](#BhargavaRKumarPPhogatHKaurAKumarM.O-A3ED3CB2) However, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial concluded that 12 months of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids did not significantly improve signs and symptoms of DED.​[[60]](#TheDryEyeAssessmentAndManagementStu-B2418885) Advise patients that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids has general health benefits but may or may not decrease symptoms of DED. Examples of food rich in omega-3 fatty acids include herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines, tuna, canola and flaxseed oil, and various seeds (e.g., pumpkin, sunflower, flaxseed).​[[53]](#psc1016n01055)​[[61]](#LewinGASchachterHMYuenDEtAl.Effects-A3EE1F4B)

### Monitoring of Therapy

Patients with intermittent symptoms of mild-moderate dry eye can be treated effectively with 1 or more of the numerous ocular lubricants available. The patient should be assessed by a health-care practitioner if symptoms do not resolve within 3–5 days or if they worsen.

Signs of preservative toxicity include stinging upon instillation and conjunctival inflammation.​[[5]](#psc1016n1004)​[[21]](#psc1016n1020)​[[25]](#psc1016n1011)​[[34]](#JonesLDownieLEKorbDEtAl.TFOSDEWSIIM-B23669E7) If these symptoms are present, the patient may need a product with a different preservative, a preservative-free product or a referral for assessment.

Periodic assessment of eye drop and ointment instillation technique will help patients make best use of the agents (see Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis, Proper Use of Eye Drops, Proper Use of Eye Ointments—What You Need to Know). Devices such as the AutoDrop and AutoSqueeze ([Owen Mumford](http://www.owenmumford.com)) are usually available through local wholesalers and can be offered to patients to aid in ocular medication administration.
