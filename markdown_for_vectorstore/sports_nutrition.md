CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

Nutritional recommendations are often clearly outlined for the general population. However, athletes require adjustments due to the demands of competitive sport. While achieving macronutrient targets is critical for athletes, micronutrients, nutritional timing and hydration should also be considered.

### Determining Daily Maintenance Calories

Prior to making any dietary adjustments targeting an athlete’s specific goals, baseline calories should be determined. Energy balance is when total energy intake equals total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), resulting in no change in body weight over the long term.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein) Calories consumed in this balance are often referred to as “maintenance” calories.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid) Estimating maintenance calories is inherently difficult as athletes are highly individualized and TDEE is influenced by several factors (see [Table 1](#TDEE)).​[[3]](#Aragon2017) There are several methods and equations used to estimate maintenance calories—each with varying degrees of complexity, accessibility and accuracy.​[[4]](#Mifflin1990)​[[5]](#McArdle2006) One widely used equation is the Mifflin-St Jeor formula (see [Table 2](#CalculatingMaintenanceCalories)).​[[4]](#Mifflin1990)

Prior to making any dietary adjustments targeting an athlete’s specific goals, baseline calories should be determined. Estimating maintenance calories can be a starting point. Competitive athletes need overall caloric intake to optimize performance, sustain extreme physical exercise, achieve desired body weight, and align with specific macronutrient and micronutrient targets. Once an athlete begins consuming the suggested caloric intake, further review should be considered based on fluctuations in body weight, optimizing lean body mass, performance, hunger cues and energy levels. An athlete’s target caloric intake is composed of macronutrient targets, which are individually discussed below.

**Table 1:** Components of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[3]](#Aragon2017)

| Component | Description | Example | Estimated Percentage of TDEE (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basal metabolic rate (BMR) | Energy needed for the body to complete the most basic life-sustaining functions (i.e., completely at rest). | Breathing Cardiac functions | 60–70 |
| Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) | Physical activity outside of structured exercise. Varies widely between individuals. | Standing Subconscious movement (e.g., tapping foot) | 15–50 |
| Thermic effect of food (TEF) | Energy spent metabolizing food. Varies depending on amount and type of food consumed. | Absorption Digestion Metabolism Excretion | 8–15 |
| Exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT) | Physical activity within a structured exercise program. | Running Weight lifting Yoga | 15-30 |

**Table 2:** Calculating Maintenance Calories with the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula​[[4]](#Mifflin1990)​[[6]](#FAO2004)

| Step 1: Calculate resting energy expenditure (REE) |
| Males | REE = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5 |
| Females | REE = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161 |
| Step 2: Determine total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) |
| Lifestyle | Example | Calculation |
| Sedentary | Office worker getting no exercise | REE x 1.2 |
| Lightly active | Office worker getting light exercise 1–3 days/wk | REE x 1.375 |
| Moderately active | Person exercising 3–5 days/wk | REE x 1.55 |
| Active | Construction worker or person running 1 h daily | REE x 1.725 |
| Vigorously active | Agricultural worker (nonmechanized) or person swimming 2 h daily | REE x 1.9 |

### Macronutrients and Fibre

Calories are consumed in the form of macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates and fat.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Macronutrients may be prescribed based on percentage of calories (e.g., protein to account for 30% of total daily calories) or based on total body weight (e.g., 2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day).​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) While prescribing macronutrient targets based on body weight is reasonable, it doesn’t completely account for overall calorie consumption.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid) It is likely that both of the above approaches will need to be considered. While each macronutrient contains differing amounts of calories per gram, there should be a balance of specific macronutrient consumption to overall calorie consumption (see [Table 3](#Macronutrientscaloriespergram)).

Various sport organizations offer recommendations to provide guidelines on energy and macronutrient intake for athletes (see [Table 4](#psc1045n00003)). Although these recommendations are evidence-informed targets for most athletes, further individualization is likely necessary. Additionally, nutritional targets for athletes are not static. Periodical review of nutritional intake and physical training allows for peak performance.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)

**Table 3:** Macronutrient Calories per Gram​[[8]](#Helms2014a)

| Macronutrient | kcal per gram |
| --- | --- |
| Carbohydrate | 4 |
| Fat | 9 |
| Protein | 4 |

**Table 4:** Macronutrient Recommendations for Athletes​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)​[[9]](#Potgieter2013)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)

| Macronutrient | Recommended Daily Intake |
| --- | --- |
| Carbohydrate | 3–10 g/kg body weight Up to 12 g/kg body weight for extreme and prolonged activities (e.g., greater than 4–5 h per day of moderate to high intensity).​ [7] ​ [10] |
| Fat | Athletes may typically consume 20–35% of total caloric intake from fat. Amounts are commonly adjusted to achieve individualized body composition goals.​ [7] Prolonged fat consumption of less than 20% of daily caloric intake or 0.5 g per kg of body weight should be discouraged. Extreme limitations in fat consumption will reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids.​ [2] ​ [7] |
| Protein | 1.2–2 g/kg body weight​ [1] ​ [7] Up to 1.6-3.1 g/kg body weight are suggested if an athlete is in a caloric deficit to prevent loss of muscle mass.​ [1] ​ [2] ​ [7] ​ [8] ​ [11] ​ [12] |

### Carbohydrate

Carbohydrates receive a great deal of attention in athletics and are the key sources of energy for the body. Carbohydrates help maximize muscle and liver glycogen stores before exercise and promote faster recovery of stores after exercise. When possible, athletes should select complex carbohydrates (e.g., starch) because they are digested slowly and therefore supply a sustained release of energy. They also provide fibre, iron (if enriched), magnesium and many of the B vitamins necessary for energy metabolism. Individualized carbohydrate targets should reflect total caloric intake, specific training needs, food preferences and feedback from training performance.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) A summary of daily carbohydrate targets for athletes can be found in [Table 5](#DailyCarbohydrateTargetsBasedOnExer).

**Table 5:** Daily Carbohydrate Targets Based on Exercise Level​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)​[[9]](#Potgieter2013)

| Daily Exercise Level | Daily Carbohydrate Targets(g per kg of body weight) |
| --- | --- |
| Light or low intensity activity (less than 1 h) | 3–5 |
| Moderate (approximately 1 h) | 5–7 |
| High (approximately 1–3 h of moderate- to high-intensity exercise) | 6–10 |
| Very high (greater than 4–5 h of moderate- to high-intensity exercise) | 8–12 |

### Carbohydrate Timing

Carbohydrate consumption and timing is most critical in moderate- to high-intensity endurance activities, but also in resistance-based activities.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) Carbohydrate consumption maintains glycogen stores (within the liver and skeletal muscle), which is of great importance to performance outcomes.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) As glycogen stores are depleted through exercise, an athlete’s ability to maintain exercise intensity and work output decreases.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017)​[[14]](#Coyle1985) When an athlete completes multiple bouts of training or sport in the same day, timing of carbohydrates (and overall nutritional status) becomes more important due to increased demands for performance and recovery.

### Carbohydrate Loading Prior to Competition

Carbohydrate loading is recommended for athletes who compete in events that last 90 minutes or longer, such as marathons, triathlons and cross-country skiing. In the days leading to a competition, the athlete consumes 60–70% of calories from carbohydrate, while simultaneously decreasing the intensity and duration of exercise.​[[15]](#Turner2001) The type of carbohydrate consumed is less important than the amount ingested.​[[16]](#Sedlock2008) Athletes who follow this regimen for up to a week before competition can significantly increase the glycogen content of exercised muscles; this elevation can persist for 5 days with limited physical exercise and taking in 60% of calories from carbohydrate.​[[16]](#Sedlock2008)​[[17]](#Arnall2007) This strategy has been shown to enhance performance, presumably by delaying fatigue.​[[16]](#Sedlock2008) The type and duration of dietary manipulation and the exercise/training activities varies and is flexible enough to personalize the athlete’s pre-event preparation.​[[16]](#Sedlock2008)

Carbohydrate loading in women has not been well studied. Research has shown that up to 93% of total energy as carbohydrate is required, potentially disrupting daily energy requirements.​[[18]](#Tarnopolsky1995) The menstrual cycle may play a role as there is a greater capacity for storage of glycogen during the luteal phase than during the follicular phase.​[[19]](#McLay2007) Additional research is needed in this area.

### Carbohydrates During Exercise

During or immediately following exercise, there is potential to optimize performance through targeted carbohydrate consumption. Recommendations vary depending on the type of exercise being completed (see [Table 6](#CarbohydratesConsumption)).

Current literature on carbohydrate recommendations are based on male endurance athletes. However, more studies are displaying that female athletes deplete glycogen stores at a different rate when compared to male counterparts.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017)​[[20]](#Riddell2003)​[[21]](#Devries2006)​[[22]](#Carter2001)​[[23]](#Wismann2006) More research is needed on this topic.

Overall, timing of carbohydrates throughout the day may align with higher carbohydrate intake prior to or during training sessions to promote performance and recovery. When energy needs are met, carbohydrate intake may simply be guided by convenience and athlete preference.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017)

**Table 6:** Recommended Carbohydrate Consumption for Specific Exercise Types​[[13]](#Kerksick2017)

| Specific Exercise Activity | Example | Recommended Carbohydrate Consumption and Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repetitive endurance exercise (less than 4 h of recovery time) | Multiple races or games per day | Aggressive refeed of 1.2 g per kg of body weight per h. Consider combining carbohydrates (0.8 g per kg of body weight per h) with protein (0.2–0.4 kg per kg of body weight per h). |
| Prolonged high-intensity endurance exercise (greater than 60 min) | Long distance running, cycling, rowing, etc. | Consume 30–60 g per h. Distribute dose every 10–15 min. |
| Resistance exercise | Weightlifting, crossfit | Consumption, in small amounts, with or without protein. Evidence is limited and further research regarding specifics of dosing is required. |

### Side Effects and Safety Considerations

There are a drawbacks to both high– and low-carbohydrate consumption. To consume high amounts of carbohydrates while maintaining low food volume, athletes may select simple carbohydrates. However, simple carbohydrates contain limited nutritional value. High carbohydrate consumption (e.g., carbohydrate loading) may also cause weight gain and feelings of sluggishness.​[[15]](#Turner2001) These symptoms are in response to the body storing 2.7 g of water for every 1 g of glycogen stored in the muscle tissue.​[[15]](#Turner2001) Alternatively, low carbohydrate consumption may result in low energy, impaired concentration and increased feelings of exertion.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)

### Fat

Fat plays an essential role in maintaining cell membranes and aiding in the absorption of fat soluble vitamins and is therefore a necessary component of a healthy diet.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Fat should comprise between 20–35% of total energy intake.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Individualization of fat intake should be based on an athlete’s training level, dietary preferences and body composition goals.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)

### Side Effects and Safety Considerations

For athletes on caloric-restricted diets, fat consumption may be inappropriately low. Extreme fat restriction limits food choices and sources of protein. A prolonged consumption of less than 20% of total calories may compromise fat stores, thereby inhibiting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Therefore athletes should maintain fat consumption above 20% of total energy intake or no less than 0.5 g per kg of body weight per day.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Athletes requiring a high caloric intake (>5000 calories per day) are recommended to consume less than or equal to 35% of calories from fat.​[[15]](#Turner2001)​[[24]](#Rodriguez2009) A high-fat diet is associated with impaired exercise capacity​[[25]](#Hawley1998) and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.​[[26]](#Sarna1994) For more information on dietary fat, see Special Diets.

Despite growing popularity of the ketogenic diet, there is currently insufficient evidence to support this nutritional strategy in improving athletic performance.

### Protein

Compared to sedentary individuals, higher protein intake is suggested for athletes to support metabolic adaptation, muscle repair and protein turnover.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Recommended protein intake for athletes is 1.2–2 g/kg of body weight per day.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Slight variability exists between expert groups regarding the recommended range.​[[27]](#ACSMProteinIntake) During hypocaloric periods, athletes benefit from a further increase in protein intake (1.6–3.1 g per kg of body weight per day) to retain lean body mass.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)​[[28]](#Philips2011)​[[29]](#Wall2015)

It is possible to consume adequate protein from dietary sources. The best protein sources include high-quality protein such as lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products, legumes, nuts and soy products (e.g., tofu, tempeh).​[[27]](#ACSMProteinIntake) However, select athletes may struggle to meet protein targets through diet alone, especially if on a restricted diet. Supplemental protein products may be used to achieve a protein target while minimizing total caloric intake or due to convenience.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)

Preferred supplemental protein products include high-quality sources such as whey, casein or soy.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)​[[27]](#ACSMProteinIntake)​[[30]](#Tipton2004) These products have been shown to improve muscle repair and hypertrophy in response to training.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C)​[[27]](#ACSMProteinIntake)​[[30]](#Tipton2004)​[[31]](#Tipton2007) Numerous consumable protein products (e.g., powders, drinks, bars) are available. Selection should be made on protein quality, product macronutrients (e.g., ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrates) and convenience.

### Protein Timing

It was believed that protein consumption needed to occur immediately postexercise to benefit from skeletal muscle hypertrophy and to promote recovery.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) Ideally, protein consumption should occur postexercise; however, the window for benefit is quite broad. The anabolic effects of exercise are most prevalent immediately posttraining and diminish gradually over a 24-hour period.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) As the digestive process is slow, when protein consumption is evenly spaced (approximately every 3 h during the day), postexercise protein intake is not as critical. The protein ingestion timing relating to physical activity may be left to individual preference, as there are benefits of ingestion both prior to and post exercise.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)

### Side Effects and Safety Considerations

Extensive research has demonstrated the safety of long-term, high-protein diets.​[[32]](#Antonio2015)​[[33]](#Antonio2016a)​[[34]](#Antonio2016b)​[[35]](#Antonio2014)​[[36]](#Martin2005)​[[37]](#Poortmans2000) Dietary protein intake much higher than current recommendations for athletes (e.g. 2.5–3.3 g per kg of body weight per day) has shown to be safe.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein) Despite proven safety, concern remains regarding higher protein intakes.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein) Undoubtedly individuals with pre or existing renal failure benefit from low-protein diets.​[[38]](#Fouque2009) However, much worry has stemmed from renal and hepatic failure literature and has been inappropriately applied to a healthy athletic population.​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein) There are, however, a few concerns regarding high intake of dietary or supplemental protein:

- Diets high in protein are often high in fat
- Displacement of other nutrients due to high protein intake
- Acceleration of the progression of pre-existing renal disease​[[1]](#Jager2017Protein)​[[39]](#Brenner1982)
- Protein supplements may cause flatulence and/or stomach upset

### Fibre

Fibre consumption is important for gut health and improving satiety while decreasing overall caloric intake.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[40]](#Kristensen2011) Current fibre recommendations are 14 g per 1000 kcals, which equals approximately 25 g per day for females and 38 g per day for males.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid) Athletes who are focused on eating whole or “clean” foods should be cautioned on excessive fibre intake. Diets that are excessively high in fibre can be detrimental to gastrointestinal health and the ability to absorb nutrients.​[[41]](#Shah2009) The suggested maximum fibre intake is 20% of total carbohydrate intake per day.​[[41]](#Shah2009)

### Meal Frequency and Timing

Meal frequency and timing for athletes has been controversial. Meal frequency simply refers to the number of times per day one consumes nutrients (i.e., meals or snacks).​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) It was believed that 6–8 meals per day improved body composition.​[[13]](#Kerksick2017) However, it is now generally accepted that a moderate number of meals per day (i.e., 3–6) offers the same effects on weight loss and body composition (when calorie intake is equal).​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid)​[[42]](#Helms2014)​[[43]](#Schoenfeld2015) Consuming an extremely low or high number of meals can impact dietary adherence.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid) These extremes can also negatively impact training and result in poor food relationships.​[[2]](#MuscleStrengthPyramid) Additionally, there is no existing evidence to support positive outcomes of calories primarily consumed at any particular point of the day (e.g., breakfast, dinner).​[[13]](#Kerksick2017)

### Micronutrients

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Vitamin and Mineral Products: Liquid Combinations, Single Entity, Solid Combinations.

There are no specific micronutrient guidelines for athletes; athletes should therefore consume the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).​[[44]](#psc1045n01058) Most athletes will be able to consume micronutrient targets through a well-balanced diet. However, various factors can contribute to micronutrient deficiencies among athletes: energy intake restriction (e.g., severe weight-loss practices, elimination of 1 or more food groups) or consuming high– or low–carbohydrate diets of low–micronutrient density.

The female athlete triad includes the 3 interrelated conditions of amenorrhea, disordered eating and low bone mineral density. Female athletes with nutritionally inadequate diets and/or amenorrhea or menstrual disturbances are at higher risk of early osteoporosis and may have higher calcium and vitamin D requirements.​[[47]](#Rauh2010)

**B vitamins** are essential for energy metabolism and are adequately supplied if sufficient calories and plenty of complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables are part of an athlete’s diet. Those following a gluten-free diet may have difficulty meeting their vitamin B requirements, as many gluten-free products are not fortified. Vegans and some vegetarians require a vitamin B12 supplement.

Calcium is important for metabolic processes including bone health (protecting against stress fractures), muscle contraction, nerve conduction and clotting functions.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018) The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommends 1500 mg per day of calcium with the focus on dietary consumption and supplementation, if required.​[[45]](#Mountjoy2014) Some good dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, fortified dairy alternatives (e.g., nut, rice, soy-based products), fortified orange juice, tofu, figs, beans, collards and broccoli.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin required for adequate calcium absorption and regulation of serum calcium and phosphorus levels. It also regulates the development and homeostasis of the nervous system and skeletal muscle. In athletes, it has shown to decrease the risk of stress fractures and has a positive effect on injury prevention.​[[26]](#Sarna1994)​[[46]](#Lukaski2004) Those who live in northern climates or train primarily indoors year-round are at risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially if they do not consume foods fortified with vitamin D.​[[45]](#Mountjoy2014) Many athletes will not be able to consume adequate dietary vitamin D to maintain target levels or correct deficiencies.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018)

The IOC recommends 1500–2000 units per day of vitamin D to optimize bone health in athletes with low energy intake or menstrual dysfunction.​[[45]](#Mountjoy2014)

Iron is needed to carry oxygen (via hemoglobin) to active muscle cells.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018) Iron depletion is more common in the following situations: endurance athletes, heavy menstruation, inadequate dietary intake and regular blood donors.​[[48]](#DellaValle2013) Female endurance athletes are at higher risk of iron deficiency.​[[48]](#DellaValle2013) Most experts agree that the iron requirements for athletes are higher than the RDA recommendations, although there is no consensus on a target dose.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018) Lack of iron leads to fatigue; however, mild iron deficiency has little effect on performance.​[[49]](#Zhu1997) Athletes who are at risk or concerned about iron deficiency should be tested and receive dietary recommendations or supplementation.

Magnesium plays a role in regulating metabolism, including energy utilization and work performance. Engaging in intensive exercise may decrease tissue magnesium levels, partly due to magnesium losses in perspiration.​[[50]](#Kerksick2018) Increasing magnesium intake of athletes with magnesium deficiency may help reduce physiological strain during exercise.​[[51]](#Lukaski2002) Supplementation or increased dietary intake of magnesium does not appear to have a beneficial effect on exercise performance unless a deficiency is present.​[[50]](#Kerksick2018) Foods sources of magnesium include halibut, cashews, artichoke, peanut butter, pinto beans, banana, potato and broccoli.

**Antioxidants** (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, **selenium**) help protect the body’s cells from free-radical damage. Exercise produces free radicals, which are capable of damaging muscle fibres.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018) However, physical training may enhance the antioxidant defense system to offset the reactive oxygen species generated during exercise.​[[52]](#Tauler2006) Athletes should focus on consuming a diet that is rich in antioxidants including fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains and legumes. Little available evidence supports antioxidant supplementation enhancing athletic performance, but it may benefit recovery.​[[53]](#Peternelij2011)

It is preferable for an athlete’s micronutrient needs to be met through food sources rather than supplements. If an athlete’s diet is nutritionally complete, using supplements has not been shown to enhance performance.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018)​[[46]](#Lukaski2004)

### Hydration

Exercise generates body heat, which is lost through evaporation of fluid (sweat) from the skin. Some elite athletes lose as much as 1–2 L of fluid per hour, and dehydration can occur quickly without fluid replacement.​[[15]](#Turner2001)​[[24]](#Rodriguez2009) Common signs of dehydration include dizziness, tiredness, nausea, chills, headache and muscle cramps.

Adequate fluid intake before, during and after exercise is necessary to prevent dehydration, which can decrease exercise performance and increase risk of potentially life-threatening heat injury such as heat stroke. Athletes are encouraged to consume a fluid volume of 5–10 mL per kg of body weight in the 2–4 hours before exercise (until urine is pale yellow in colour), sufficient fluid to replace sweat losses during exercise and sufficient fluid to restore any deficit after exercise. Hydration strategies must be customized, as sweat rates vary during exercise from 0.3–2.4 L per hour, depending on exercise duration and intensity, climate, altitude and the athlete’s level of fitness. Acute changes in body weight reflect change in body water and allow athletes to track their hydration status. Pre- and postexercise body weight measurements aid in estimation of fluid loss; a loss of 1 kg body weight correlates to 1 L sweat loss. While the sensation of thirst is a good indication of the need for fluid, it is not a timely sign of dehydration.​[[10]](#Bytomski2018)

Water can replace fluid lost in sweat but may not be adequate for rehydration because it does not contain energy or electrolytes. Most people exercising for less than 1 hour require fluids through water consumption only. Sports drinks may be appropriate when participating for less than 1 hour in intense sports, when doing endurance sports (greater than 1 hour) or when exercising in hot weather.​[[15]](#Turner2001)​[[24]](#Rodriguez2009)​[[54]](#Marriage1999)​[[55]](#CoachingAssociation)​[[56]](#vonDuvillard2008)

Sports drinks provide energy (from glucose, glucose polymers, sucrose) and electrolytes. Beverages containing 6–8% glucose or sucrose are absorbed as rapidly as water and provide energy needed for prolonged exercise.​[[54]](#Marriage1999) Electrolytes replace lost sodium, chloride and potassium and enhance the palatability of the beverage. Sodium helps to retain ingested fluids and should be included in fluid replacement during and after exercise when large sweat losses occur.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) Sodium and chloride help ensure an adequate intake of fluid and stimulate greater rehydration or thirst after exercise.

Fruit juices and soft drinks are concentrated sources of carbohydrate (>10% carbohydrate concentration), which may deter fluid replacement and cause GI discomfort.​[[54]](#Marriage1999) A homemade sports drink can be made by diluting unsweetened fruit juice with water and adding iodized table salt, e.g., 500 mL unsweetened orange juice, 500 mL water and 1–2 mL (one-quarter to one-half teaspoonful) iodized table salt (one-quarter teaspoonful table salt = 500 mg Na+);​[[55]](#CoachingAssociation) the resulting 1 L mixture contains 54 g (5.4%) carbohydrate.

**Hyperhydration**

Excessive drinking of water during exercise can cause hyponatremia (blood sodium <135 mmol/L). Signs of hyponatremia include weight/fluid gain, mental confusion and general weakness.

Hyponatremia can lead to seizures, coma and even death. Recreational athletes have been identified as being at risk of overhydration and hyponatremia, as their work output and sweat rates are lower, and their belief in the need to drink and opportunities to drink are often greater, compared with competitive athletes.​[[7]](#refitem-126212-042B947C) To prevent overhydration during an event, recreational athletes are encouraged to drink only enough water to quench thirst.

### Nutritional Supplements as Ergogenic Aids

Athletes may select to use nutritional supplements in an attempt to support overall performance. While some supplements have efficacy and safety data to support long-term use, other products may be contaminated, harmful or prohibited in competitive sport. Efficacy and safety should be assessed as part of comprehensive patient care for the individual athlete (See Drug Use and Abuse in Sports).
