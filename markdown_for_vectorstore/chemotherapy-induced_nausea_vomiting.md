### Introduction

Managing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving anti-cancer treatments is a challenge. Although data on relative emetogenicity are available for many IV chemotherapeutic agents, there is less data available on oral chemotherapy regimens, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy.

Commonly called chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the condition is classified into 5 types: acute, delayed, anticipatory, refractory and breakthrough. Whether acute or delayed nausea and vomiting is experienced depends most strongly on the actual chemotherapy agents administered and their dosage and infusion rate.​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)

Acute CINV:

- Starts within a few minutes to hours after anti-cancer drug administration and usually does not persist beyond 24 hours
- Occurs in >90% of patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens (e.g., cisplatin, cyclophosphamide)​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)
- Patient-related risk factors include younger age, past history of low alcohol intake, poor control of symptoms in prior cycles, history of motion sickness or nausea in pregnancy, and female sex. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients*.)​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)
- The neurotransmitter most responsible is serotonin (5-HT3 receptors), while type 2 dopamine and neurokinin-1 receptors also play a role​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)
- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy cause enterochromaffin cells lining the GI tract to release serotonin in large amounts, activating 5-HT3 receptors in the GI tract, which stimulate the vomiting centre in the medulla oblongata​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)

Delayed CINV:

- Begins at least 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy and may last for 6–7 days​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)
- Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide are the most commonly used drugs that cause acute as well as delayed nausea and vomiting, often with a nausea and vomiting–free period in between. With cisplatin, the incidence of delayed nausea and/or vomiting may be as high as 80%​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)​[[2]](#psc1030n00049)
- Serotonin is less important in delayed nausea and vomiting, while substance P-dependent mechanisms appear to play a significant role​[[3]](#psc1030n00051)

Anticipatory CINV:

- A conditioned or learned response to previously poorly managed nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients
- Occurs in approximately 25% of patients by the fourth course of chemotherapy​[[4]](#c0109n00027)
- Occurs before, during or immediately after chemotherapy administration but before acute nausea and vomiting would be expected to occur
- Usually worsens with each cycle; up to 30% of patients refuse further chemotherapy because of intolerable nausea and vomiting​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)​[[5]](#c0109n00030)

Refractory CINV:

- Occurs in subsequent cycles when antiemetic prophylaxis has not been effective in earlier cycles

Breakthrough CINV:

- Occurs within 5 days of treatment despite optimal antiemetic regimen; requires rescue therapy with other antiemetics

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent or minimize acute, delayed, anticipatory and refractory nausea and vomiting to maintain quality of life, help patient adherence with active treatment and avoid treatment delays
- Decrease incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting (once it has occurred) and maintain patient comfort​[[4]](#c0109n00027)
- Prevent complications, such as esophageal tears, dehydration, anorexia, malnutrition, weight loss, pathological bone fractures, metabolic alkalosis, chloride and potassium depletion​[[4]](#c0109n00027)

### Investigations

- A thorough history including:

  - onset and duration of symptoms
  - timing of nausea and/or retching and/or vomiting
  - effect on the patient, e.g., weight loss, asthenia
  - description of the vomiting episodes
  - medications
- Physical examination with particular attention to:

  - orthostatic hypotension
  - abdominal pain, distention, constipation, hemorrhage
  - neurologic assessment including cranial nerves, vestibular and pupillary functions, extrapyramidal signs
- Laboratory tests:

  - electrolytes: urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride (to assess hydration status); calcium, albumin (to assess for hypercalcemia)
  - drug screening, such as for digoxin if suspected as a cause of nausea and vomiting

Although medication is the most likely cause of nausea and vomiting in a patient receiving cancer treatment, rule out other potential causes (e.g., fluid/electrolyte abnormalities, partial or complete bowel obstruction, brain or hepatic metastases, infections, radiation therapy). Other drugs (e.g., opioids, digoxin, antibiotics) may cause or exacerbate nausea and vomiting; therefore, a thorough medication history is essential. Some anti-cancer agents are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting than others (see [Table 1](#c0109n00011) and [Table 2](#table-1934-8FE9792D)). It is important to consider the emetogenic potential, the dose of the chemotherapy agents and the expected pattern of emesis of the chemotherapy regimen when choosing antiemetics.​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)​[[5]](#c0109n00030)​[[11]](#c0109n00152) For combination chemotherapy regimens, manage the patient based on the drug with the highest emetogenic potential.

Patient-specific factors such as <50 years of age, female sex, and a history of motion sickness, nausea in pregnancy or CINV may raise the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting;​[[12]](#c0109n00252) therefore, antiemetic regimens must be tailored to the individual patient.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Dietary adjustment suggestions for patients:

  - try small, light meals several times daily
  - avoid foods high in fat or those with a heavy aroma
  - try dry, starchy foods, such as crackers
  - if unable to tolerate solid foods, try ice chips and small sips of clear liquids
  - avoid food preparation because the smell of food cooking often worsens nausea
- Behavioural methods to recommend:​[[4]](#c0109n00027)

  - practice relaxation techniques to help decrease physiologic arousal and anxiety
  - use individualized exercise programs to help decrease anxiety
  - try systematic desensitization (a behavioural therapy in which the patient is gradually conditioned to replace the nausea response to stimuli with a relaxation response) to avoid anticipatory nausea and vomiting
- Other advice for patients:​[[4]](#c0109n00027)

  - keep movement to a minimum; rest in bed or a chair to avoid vestibular stimulation
  - try acupuncture and acupressure​[[13]](#c0109n00034)​[[14]](#c0109n00035)​[[15]](#c0109n00251)
  - prioritize sleep​[[16]](#c0109n00036)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Nausea and vomiting are mediated through a number of receptors; however, the type 3 serotonin (5-HT3) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors appear to be most important in CINV. Antiemetic agents targeting other neurotransmitters are important additional agents to help provide optimal prevention and treatment, but are not used as single agents for moderate or highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. Combining antiemetic drugs with different receptor targets can be an effective strategy in managing nausea and vomiting.

- Prevention of acute nausea and vomiting is the best way to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting.
- Successful prevention of acute and delayed CINV in a current chemotherapy cycle is the best way to prevent anticipatory and refractory nausea and vomiting in subsequent cycles.
- Use antiemetic therapy to prevent anticipatory nausea and vomiting.
- Regularly scheduled and administered antiemetics (not PRN) are more effective at preventing nausea and vomiting.

[Figure 1](#c0109n00003) outlines the prevention of CINV and management of breakthrough nausea and vomiting for regimens with minimal, low, moderate and high emetogenic potential. Individual medications are detailed in [Table 3](#c0109n00026).

### Serotonin Antagonists

The first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) granisetron and ondansetron have equivalent efficacy and toxicity when used for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.​[[18]](#c0109n00052)​[[19]](#c0109n00053) Single-agent efficacy is reported with ondansetron, but when it is used in combination with olanzapine, dexamethasone and an NK-1 receptor antagonist, efficacy for highly emetogenic regimens is improved. Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-HT3RA. When administered IV, it is effective in preventing both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The oral dosage form is effective in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with MEC; it is available only as a fixed-dose combination with netupitant.​[[20]](#c0109n00143)​[[21]](#c0109n00144)​[[22]](#c0109n00234)​[[23]](#c0109n00235) Single-dose IV palonosetron prior to start of chemotherapy may be a more convenient option over the first-generation agents if multiple-day 5-HT3RA dosing is anticipated. These drugs are generally well tolerated with constipation and headache the most common adverse reactions.

### Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists

The NK-1 receptor antagonists aprepitant, fosaprepitant and netupitant bind to substance P, found in the brainstem and GI tract. Fosaprepitant is used intravenously; aprepitant and netupitant are oral agents, with netupitant available only as a fixed-dose combination with palonosetron.​[[24]](#Shirley2021) When added to a regimen of olanzapine, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3RA for HEC, NK-1 receptor antagonists improve prevention of acute and delayed emesis.​[[25]](#Aapro2017)​[[26]](#Karthaus2019) Aprepitant and netupitant inhibit CYP3A4 and interact with corticosteroids, requiring a decrease in the antiemetic dose of dexamethasone when used concomitantly. These agents appear to be well-tolerated. Asthenia/fatigue and hiccups are the most commonly reported side effects with aprepitant, and constipation, fatigue and headache are the most common with netupitant.

### Corticosteroids

Dexamethasone is the corticosteroid most commonly used in the management of CINV, although several others including methylprednisolone have been studied.​[[27]](#c0109n00045) The actual mechanism of action is unknown, but corticosteroids appear to be effective as single agents or in combination with other antiemetics and are particularly effective in the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting.​[[27]](#c0109n00045)​[[28]](#c0109n00046) The combination of dexamethasone with olanzapine, a 5-HT3RA and an NK-1 receptor antagonist is the most effective antiemetic regimen for acute nausea and vomiting.​[[29]](#c0109n00043)​[[30]](#c0109n00047) For patients receiving HEC or MEC who have few risk factors for CINV, or for patients who are intolerant of corticosteroids, dexamethasone can be given on Day 1 only or replaced with olanzapine.

### Dopamine Antagonists

Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide are the dopamine antagonists most commonly used in the management of nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy regimens with low emetogenicity or as rescue agents.​[[10]](#c0109n00199) Both agents block the dopaminergic receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Prochlorperazine may also exhibit serotonin antagonistic activity at higher doses. The availability of a wide variety of dosage forms (tablet, suppository, injectable) facilitates prochlorperazine use, especially for outpatients. Low doses of metoclopramide (10–20 mg) are generally as effective as prochlorperazine; however, in high doses (1–3 mg/kg), metoclopramide provides significantly higher antiemetic activity.​[[31]](#c0109n00038) A limitation to dopamine antagonist use is the development of extrapyramidal side effects.

Although insufficient evidence from randomized, controlled trials exists,​[[32]](#c0109n00207) haloperidol may be useful in the management of refractory nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy,​[[10]](#c0109n00199)​[[33]](#c0109n00054)​[[34]](#c0109n00055) but may be less effective than metoclopramide.​[[35]](#c0109n00208)

Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic agent that antagonizes several neurotransmitter receptors involved in the emetic pathway, including dopamine, 5-HT, histamine and acetylcholine-muscarine. Regimens containing olanzapine have demonstrated efficacy in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from HEC and MEC, and olanzapine monotherapy has proven effective in the treatment of breakthrough nausea and vomiting.​[[36]](#Sutherland2018) Expert groups support the use of olanzapine as part of 2-drug to 4-drug regimens for the prevention of CINV and as monotherapy for the treatment of breakthrough nausea and vomiting.​[[8]](#refitem-1132140-4277748C)​[[10]](#c0109n00199)

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines provide useful antianxiety, amnesic and sedating effects. Lorazepam and alprazolam are the most commonly used, and have been studied in cases of anticipatory nausea.​[[37]](#c0109n00146)​[[38]](#c0109n00147) They are usually used in combination with antiemetics.​[[8]](#refitem-1132140-4277748C)​[[10]](#c0109n00199)

### Cannabinoids

The synthetic cannabinoid nabilone is of limited use because it is available only as an oral formulation and is associated with several side effects including dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, mood alterations, hallucinations, delusions, tachycardia and hypotension.​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)​[[39]](#c0109n00057)​[[40]](#c0109n00058) Higher doses are associated with increased risk of side effects. It is generally used in refractory nausea and vomiting or in combination with other antiemetics.​[[1]](#psc1030n00044)

The College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) indicates that cannabis (the dried plant or oil extracts) may be used in patients with treatment-refractory CINV who have failed to respond to standard therapies and a trial of nabilone.​[[41]](#CFPCcannabis)​[[42]](#CPScannabis) Medical cannabis is not recommended in standard antiemesis guidelines.​[[10]](#c0109n00199)​[[43]](#ASCOguideline)

### Antihistamines and Anticholinergics

The antihistamine dimenhydrinate and the antimuscarinic scopolamine are useful for treating vomiting due to motion sickness but they are considered no more effective than placebo against CINV.​[[44]](#c0109n00059)​[[45]](#c0109n00148)

### Therapeutic Tips

- If the patient can tolerate oral antiemetics, this is the recommended route of administration. However, rectally administered antiemetics such as prochlorperazine are especially useful in patients who are vomiting or unable to take oral medications and who are at home. For hospitalized patients, the IV route of administration is recommended in patients who are vomiting.
- For multiday chemotherapy regimens, antiemetics should be given on each day of treatment. For HEC, dexamethasone and olanzapine may be given for up to 2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. For MEC, olanzapine may be continued for up to 2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.​[[10]](#c0109n00199)​[[17]](#CancerCareON)

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad322391e1405) Aprepitant is administered for 3 consecutive days beginning 1 hour before start of chemotherapy cycle. A single dose of fosaprepitant injection 30 minutes before start of chemotherapy on Day 1 may replace all 3 days of oral aprepitant dosing regimen. Netupitant is administered as a single oral dose 1 hour prior to chemotherapy.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd322391e1409) Dexamethasone-sparing regimen (dexamethasone given on Day 1 only) may be considered for patients receiving HEC who have few risk factors for CINV or who are intolerant of corticosteroids.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd322391e1412) Dexamethasone-sparing regimen (dexamethasone given on Day 1 only) may be considered for patients receiving MEC who have few risk factors for CINV or who are intolerant of corticosteroids. Olanzapine may be considered as replacement on Days 2–4.

| lorazepam Ativan , generics <$25 | 0.5–2 mg Q4–6H PO/SL | Sedation. | Additive sedation occurs with other sedating medications such as opioid analgesics, hypnotics, alcohol; avoid or minimize concurrent use if possible. |

**Drug Class: Cannabinoids**

| nabilone Cesamet , generics <$25 | Starting dose is 0.5 mg BID PO titrated up to 1–2 mg BID PO as tolerated. Maximum 6 mg per day. First dose is given the night before start of chemotherapy and the second dose is usually administered 1–3 h before chemotherapy | Sedation, dizziness, ataxia, psychotropic effects (“high”), tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth. | Additive sedation occurs with other sedating medications such as opioid analgesics, hypnotics, alcohol; avoid or minimize concurrent use if possible. |

**Drug Class: Corticosteroids**

| dexamethasone generics <$25 | Acute: 12 mg single dose PO/IV on Day 1 Increase to 20 mg in HEC or MEC if not used with NK-1 RA Delayed: 8 mg once daily PO on Days 2–4 | Mood changes, increased appetite, GI irritation, ulceration, fluid retention, weight gain, may mask signs of infection. | Dexamethasone is a CYP3A4 substrate. CYP3A4 inhibitors may decrease its metabolism. Antacids and CYP3A4 inducers may increase its metabolism. Aprepitant, fosaprepitant and netupitant may increase the serum concentration of dexamethasone. Dosing guidelines account for this by decreasing the recommended dose of dexamethasone (usually reduced from 20 mg to 8–12 mg) when aprepitant or fosaprepitant is coadministered. |

**Drug Class: Dopamine Antagonists**

| haloperidol generics <$25 | 1–2 mg Q4–6H PRN PO | Sedation, extrapyramidal effects. | Additive sedation occurs with other sedating medications such as opioid analgesics, hypnotics, alcohol; avoid or minimize concurrent use if possible. Avoid concomitant use with drugs that prolong the QT c interval when possible. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 can decrease metabolism of haloperidol; avoid combination when possible or monitor for increased toxicity. Inducers of CYP3A4 can increase the metabolism of haloperidol; avoid combination when possible or monitor for decreased effect. |
| metoclopramide generics PO: <$25 IV: $75–100 | 10–40 mg Q4–6H PRN PO/IV | Sedation, dose-related diarrhea, extrapyramidal effects. | Additive sedation occurs with other sedating medications such as opioid analgesics, hypnotics, alcohol; avoid or minimize concurrent use if possible. Anticholinergic agents antagonize effects of metoclopramide on GI motility. |
| olanzapine Zyprexa , generics <$25 | 5 mg PO before chemotherapy 5 mg daily PO or 2.5–5 mg BID PO | Dizziness, constipation, postural hypotension, akathisia, somnolence, dry mouth. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a rare but very serious adverse effect (see Drug-Induced Skin Reactions ). | Concomitant use with benzodiazepines may cause cardiorespiratory depression and excessive sedation. Use with metoclopramide may raise risk of tardive dyskinesia. Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors may decrease the metabolism of olanzapine. Olanzapine may decrease the therapeutic effect of antiparkinsonian agents. |
| prochlorperazine generics <$25 | PO: 5–10 mg TID-QID PR: 25 mg Q12H IV: 2.5–10 mg; not to exceed 40 mg/day IM: 5–10 mg initial dose, may repeat Q3–4H; not to exceed 40 mg/day | Sedation, anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nasal congestion, urinary retention), extrapyramidal effects, hypotension, hypersensitivity, pancytopenia (rare). | Additive sedation occurs with other sedating medications such as opioid analgesics, hypnotics, alcohol; avoid or minimize concurrent use if possible. |
