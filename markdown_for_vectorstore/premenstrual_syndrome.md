### Pathophysiology

### Definition

The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to the cyclic recurrence of physical and/or cognitive (behavioural) symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) that ameliorate upon onset of menses.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001) Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe subtype of PMS that includes clinically significant distress and interference with work, school, interpersonal relationships and/or social activities.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001) For a more complete discussion of the menstrual cycle, see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods or Dysmenorrhea.

PMS symptoms occur in 90% of people who menstruate and who are of reproductive age at some point in their life,​[[1]](#psc1182n1001) whereas PMDD affects only 3–8%.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001) The main focus of this chapter is PMS.

### Etiology and Risk Factors

The etiology of PMS has not been fully elucidated.​[[2]](#psc1182n1002) Several theories have been proposed involving increased sensitivity to normal fluctuations in sex steroid hormones (estradiol and progesterone) during the menstrual cycle, dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems as well as nutritional deficiencies.​[[2]](#psc1182n1002)​[[3]](#psc1182n1005)​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) While evidence for serotonin abnormalities in PMS are the most convincing, abnormalities in the catecholaminergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid neurotransmitter systems have also been observed in people with PMS.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[5]](#psc1182n1006)​[[6]](#psc1182n1007)​[[7]](#psc1182n1008)

Risk factors for PMS include high body mass index,​[[8]](#psc1182n1010) a history of domestic violence, physical or emotional trauma, and substance abuse,​[[9]](#psc1182n1011)​[[10]](#psc1182n1012) as well as affective disorders such as major depression and postpartum depression.

Deficiencies in certain nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, manganese, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin E and linoleic acid have been reported in PMS;​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) however, consistent excess or deficiency in these dietary factors has not been clearly documented in people with PMS as compared with control subjects.​[[11]](#psc1182n1009)

PMS is twice as prevalent in identical twins compared with fraternal twins, suggesting a genetic predisposition.​[[2]](#psc1182n1002)​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)

### Clinical Presentation

PMS is frequently a diagnosis of exclusion, as there is no currently accepted diagnostic test for this condition.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[12]](#psc1182n1013)​[[13]](#psc1182n1014) Indeed, some clinicians challenge the very existence of PMS.​[[12]](#psc1182n1013) The differential diagnosis may include anemia, diabetes, thyroid disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, polycystic ovaries, adverse effects from oral contraceptives, perimenopause, fibrocystic breast changes and various psychiatric disorders.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[12]](#psc1182n1013) These conditions should be considered before a firm diagnosis of PMS is made.

A diagnosis of PMS is generally agreed upon if symptoms:​[[12]](#psc1182n1013)

- Are present during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle
- Reach their peak shortly before the beginning of menstruation and remit at the onset of menses or shortly thereafter
- Are severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and interpersonal relationships
- Are absent during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle

The diagnosis of PMS is confirmed through prospective monitoring of an individual’s symptoms during at least 2 menstrual cycles.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[12]](#psc1182n1013)​[[14]](#psc1182n1015) A daily symptom calendar can be used to determine whether the symptoms are cyclical and are confined to the luteal phase.

Over the past several decades, research into PMS has identified over 100 premenstrual symptoms.​[[15]](#psc1182n1016) Symptoms of PMS can be divided into 2 broad categories: cognitive (or behavioural) and physical (see [Table 1](#psc1182n00008)). The 5​th edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5) includes PMDD as a formal diagnosis.​[[16]](#psc1182n01065)​[[17]](#refitem-1192121-98A2B157) However, debate continues surrounding the potential for pathologizing normal physiology in establishing diagnoses for PMS and PMDD.​[[18]](#psc1182n01066)

The onset of PMS and related symptoms can occur at any time after puberty with typical onset in the mid-20s. People usually seek treatment in their 30s.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) Individuals who are perimenopausal can suffer from PMS, but it subsides after menopause.

The number of symptoms required for a diagnosis of PMS is not consistent among different authorities.​[[12]](#psc1182n1013) The criteria developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists require the presence of at least 1 symptom from a list of specific cognitive and physical symptoms during the 5 days prior to menses and occurring over several cycles. Symptoms must cause social or economic decline in function.​[[19]](#psc1182n1018)​[[20]](#psc1182n1019) To prevent overdiagnosis of this condition, it is suggested that the presence of 5 or more symptoms that change in severity throughout the menstrual cycle is appropriate for a diagnosis of PMS.

**Table 1:** Symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome

| Cognitive/Behavioural | Physical |
| --- | --- |
| Aggression | Irritability | Acne | Headache |
| Anger | Lethargy | Appetite changes | Hot flashes |
| Anxiety | Mood lability | Bloating, fluid retention, oliguria | Muscle aches |
| Depression | Panic attacks | Breast pain or swelling | Nausea and vomiting |
| Fatigue | Poor concentration | Constipation | Pelvic heaviness or pressure |
| Forgetfulness | Reduced coping skills | Dizziness or vertigo | Weight gain |
| Hostility |  | Fatigue |  |

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms
- Minimize functional impairment

Health-care practitioners can support these goals by providing patient education about the pathophysiology of PMS, the proper use of symptom diaries to evaluate symptoms and available treatment options.

### Patient Assessment

For a diagnosis of PMS, patients should prospectively report symptoms in the latter half of their cycle for at least 2 menstrual cycles. [Table 2](#psc1182n00012) presents a sample chart that patients may use to record their symptoms. These complaints should be cyclic in nature, i.e., they should resolve at the start of menses and not be present during the entire menstrual cycle (see Pathophysiology, [Clinical Presentation](#psc1182n00007)). Assess or refer patients who have severe, debilitating symptoms with a strong affective or psychological component for assessment of possible PMDD (see [Table 3](#psc1182n00011)). Those with mild to moderate symptoms of PMS often do not seek or require pharmacologic treatment.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)

[a] Rate symptoms according to severity, e.g., 3 = severe, 2 = moderate, 1 = mild, 0 = absent.

**Table 3:** DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)

| A. | In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least 5 symptoms must be present in the final week before onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses and become minimal or absent in the week post menses. |
| B. | One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present: Marked affective lability, e.g., mood swings, feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge |
| C. | One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present to reach a total of 5 symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above. Decreased interest in usual activities, e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies Subjective difficulty in concentration Lethargy, easy fatigability or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain |
| Note: The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year. |
| D. | The symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with work, school, usual social activities or relationships with others, e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school or home. |
| E. | The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders). |
| F. | Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 symptomatic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.) |
| G. | The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

[Figure 1](#psc1182n00016) presents the suggested treatment of patients with PMS.

### Lifestyle Modifications

Relaxation and stress reduction techniques (reflexology, massage, biofeedback) and treatments such as acupuncture and light therapy, although not rigorously studied, can be recommended to people suffering from PMS as a means of promoting a healthy lifestyle and symptom control.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)​[[21]](#psc1182n1020)​[[22]](#psc1182n01056) Because symptoms of PMS can include both insomnia and hypersomnia, encourage appropriate sleep hygiene techniques (see Insomnia).​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) Symptom diaries (see [Table 2](#psc1182n00012)) confer a sense of understanding and control of PMS and are recommended for monitoring and improving the symptoms themselves.

Data suggest regular moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the symptoms of PMS​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[23]](#psc1182n1021) including breast tenderness, fluid retention, stress and depression.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)​[[23]](#psc1182n1021) Encourage patients to engage in moderate aerobic activity 3–4 times weekly as a method of alleviating their symptoms.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)

### Dietary Modifications

In a study on the effects of caffeine restriction, a large proportion of individuals who refrained from consuming methylxanthine-containing foods and beverages noted improvement in breast symptoms.​[[11]](#psc1182n1009) Although data are limited, it is reasonable to recommend that those who suffer from PMS limit their intake of caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate and caffeine-containing soft drinks.​[[11]](#psc1182n1009)​[[24]](#psc1182n1022)

Carbohydrate intake may lessen appetite changes and cognitive symptoms;​[[25]](#psc1182n1023) therefore, recommend small, frequent carbohydrate servings to those experiencing these symptoms.

Restricting salt intake in the luteal phase has been suggested as a method of alleviating PMS symptoms of fluid retention, weight gain, bloating, and breast swelling and tenderness.​[[20]](#psc1182n1019) Although not studied, it is a reasonable recommendation for reducing PMS symptoms.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Feminine Care Products: Dysmenorrhea and Premenstrual Syndrome Symptom Relief; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity, Solid Combinations.

The use of prostaglandin inhibitors is based on a theory that PMS results from an excess of prostaglandins. NSAID choices include ibuprofen and naproxen. Both are expected to provide symptomatic relief of headache, breast pain and muscle aches experienced during PMS.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) Ibuprofen or naproxen should be started at the onset of pain and used short term in the lowest effective dose. For more information, see Headache.

At a dose of 50–100 mg daily, pyridoxine **(vitamin B6)** may be effective in treating premenstrual syndrome in its capacity as a cofactor in the synthesis of dopamine and the metabolism of the serotonin precursor tryptophan.​[[26]](#psc1182n1028)​[[27]](#psc1182n01042) Doses exceeding 200 mg daily have been associated with peripheral neuropathy (see [Table 4](#d2e3695)).​[[27]](#psc1182n01042)

Low-dose calcium carbonate (400–500 mg daily) may alleviate symptoms of mild PMS,​[[28]](#Shobeiri2017) and higher doses (1200 mg daily) may reduce symptoms of negative affect, water retention, food cravings and pain (see [Table 4](#d2e3695)).​[[29]](#psc1182n01069)​[[30]](#psc1182n1025)

Although not a first-line option, magnesium at a dose of 200–400 mg daily throughout the menstrual cycle could be recommended to treat fluid retention.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004) A mild laxative effect has been observed with higher doses.​[[4]](#psc1182n1004)

Although **vitamin E** has been proposed as a potential treatment of PMS, there is no definitive evidence to support its efficacy.

Several combination products include an analgesic as well as pamabrom (a diuretic) and/or pyrilamine (an antihistamine). Evidence that the addition of these 2 agents offers superior efficacy over an analgesic alone is not available. Most experts believe that if these 2 agents have added benefit, their effects are mild at best.

Although combined oral contraceptives **(COCs)** containing ethinyl estradiol, and various first-, second- and third-generation progestogens have been used to treat PMS, evidence of their effectiveness is inconsistent, though there was a general trend toward improvement in both physical and cognitive symptoms.​[[20]](#psc1182n1019)​[[31]](#psc1182n01067) It is therefore reasonable to recommend the use of COCs in patients who also wish to use COCs for contraception.​[[32]](#RCOG2017)

COCs containing ethinyl estradiol 20 or 30 mcg plus drospirenone 3 mg may lessen symptom severity and improve function in patients with severe PMDD symptoms in the short term (unknown effectiveness beyond 3 cycles).​[[33]](#psc1182n1034) Drospirenone-containing COCs have not demonstrated efficacy in those with less severe PMS symptoms.​[[33]](#psc1182n1034) In Canada, COCs containing drosperinone are not indicated for PMS or PMDD. There is a small risk of venous thromboembolic events with the use of any combined oral contraceptive.​[[34]](#psc1182n01057)​[[35]](#refitem-1192153-98A8AEBF) This risk is slightly higher with those that contain cyproterone or drospirenone.​[[36]](#refitem-1192152-98A8784C)​[[37]](#refitem-1192152-98A71FE4)

The SSRIs citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline may offer short-term clinical benefit in the treatment of psychological symptoms of PMS/PMDD.​[[38]](#psc1182n1036) They may be taken at the usual antidepressant doses continuously or only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Risk of experiencing an adverse effect, particularly asthenia and nausea, with a moderate and high SSRI dose was considerable. Patients with physical symptoms only may not find SSRIs effective.

Other antidepressants such as **clomipramine**, **duloxetine** and **venlafaxine** have also been used in PMS but have comparatively less support than SSRIs for use in this population.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)

Other therapies include spironolactone for breast tenderness and fluid retention, as well as bromocriptine for breast tenderness.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001) The dopamine agonist cabergoline (0.5 mg daily on days 14 and 21 of the menstrual cycle) showed similar efficacy to bromocriptine for breast tenderness associated with PMS in a preliminary trial.​[[39]](#psc1182n01063) GnRH analogues (e.g., goserelin, leuprolide, nafarelin) and danazol (used during luteal phase) are reserved for severe or unresponsive cases of PMS due to their extensive and serious adverse effect profiles.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)

### Natural Health Products

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Health Products: Single Entity.

Oil of evening primrose has been shown to be no better than placebo in relief of PMS-related symptoms.​[[24]](#psc1182n1022)​[[40]](#psc1182n1029)​[[41]](#psc1182n1030) St. John’s wort has a lack of well-designed trials to support use.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)​[[42]](#psc1182n01055) A Cochrane review found 1 well-designed trial that supported the use of jingqianping granule, a traditional Chinese medicine that can be used for increasing the rate of recovery from PMS. However, further study is needed before this remedy can be recommended.​[[43]](#psc1182n1031) Ginkgo biloba has been shown to decrease the severity of both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS in a preliminary trial.​[[44]](#psc1182n01072) At this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend these strategies as appropriate methods of treating PMS.

Chasteberry has been found to have benefit in reducing cyclical breast discomfort and for improving symptoms of PMS overall.​[[1]](#psc1182n1001)​[[29]](#psc1182n01069)​[[45]](#psc1182n01071)​[[46]](#psc1182n1032) However, variances in dosing and study design, publication bias and high risk of bias complicate recommendations.​[[47]](#verkaik2017) Doses used in trials include 4 mg daily of an extract standardized to 6% of agnuside, 20–40 mg daily of the fruit extract, 40 drops daily of a fluid extract or 35–45 drops 3 times daily of a tincture.​[[46]](#psc1182n1032) Side effects of chasteberry include dizziness, headache, fatigue, dry mouth and mild GI discomfort. A trial comparing chasteberry with fluoxetine found similar efficacy between the 2 treatments.​[[48]](#psc1182n1033)

Aromatherapy has shown positive effects in 2 small randomized controlled trials. A trial of less than 50 individuals showed that lavender oil aromatherapy statistically reduced symptoms of anxiety, depressive affect, nervousness, pain, bloating and depressive thoughts when compared to a control group that had no intervention.​[[49]](#Uzuncakmak2018) A trial of aromatherapy with essential oils of Rosa damascene (Damascus Rose) also showed improvement of multiple symptoms of PMS when compared to placebo.​[[50]](#Heydari2018) While aromatherapy appears to be promising, it remains an experimental treatment at this time.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Encourage people with PMS to self-monitor their response to various treatment measures by charting their symptoms regularly (see [Table 2](#psc1182n00012)).

Efficacy: Patients with unrelenting or progressive symptoms despite drug therapy for 1–3 months (depending on drug and degree of response) should have treatment reassessed.

Safety: Adverse effects of drugs should be screened at appropriate intervals depending on therapy chosen.

### Drug Table

**Table 4:** Selected Therapies for Premenstrual Syndrome

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Minerals**

| calcium Caltrate , generics $3–6 | 1200 mg (elemental calcium) daily in divided doses PO | Constipation. Caution in severe renal impairment. | Decreases absorption of bisphosphonates, iron, levothyroxine, phenytoin, phosphate, quinolones, tetracyclines. Antacid effect may alter absorption of other medications; calcium dosing should be separated from other medications by 2 h. May decrease therapeutic effect of calcium channel blockers. May enhance inotropic effects of digoxin and lead to arrhythmias. Thiazide diuretics decrease excretion of calcium and may increase risk of hypercalcemia. | Improvement in mood, water retention, cravings, pain; corroborating trials are required to confirm efficacy. |
| magnesium generics < $3 | 200–400 mg daily PO | Diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness. | Magnesium salts decrease GI absorption of drugs dosed concomitantly; dosing should be separated by 2 h. | Good-quality evidence is lacking to support use, but may be helpful for fluid retention. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment and heart block. |

**Drug Class: Vitamins**

| pyridoxine generics < $3 | 50–100 mg daily PO Do not exceed 200 mg/day | Nausea, headache, paresthesia. Sensory neuropathy (ataxia, numbness of hands and feet) has occurred with chronic use of large doses. | Metabolism of levodopa increased; effect prevented when levodopa combined with carbidopa. High doses (80–200 mg/day) may increase metabolism of phenytoin and barbiturates. Estrogen therapy increases pyridoxine requirements. | Do not exceed recommended dose. |
