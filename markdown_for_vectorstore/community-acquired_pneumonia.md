### Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common and serious illness. It is typically defined by signs and symptoms such as cough, which typically is productive, shortness of breath and fever. Dullness of percussion and crackles may be heard on auscultation; these clinical findings are associated with a new infiltrate on chest x-ray. The very young and the very old, people who smoke, and those with cardiopulmonary conditions, alcohol dependence or immunodeficiency are at highest risk. While most cases (about 80%) are safely managed at home, the mortality rate among those requiring hospitalization is 8–10% and up to 40% for those requiring treatment in an ICU.​[[1]](#c0093n00021) In general, the clinical presentation of CAP does not allow for an etiologic diagnosis. Many microorganisms cause CAP (see [Table 1](#c0093n00560)).​[[2]](#c0093n00456) Each microbe can result in an illness that spans the spectrum from mild to life-threatening. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for about 50% of all cases of CAP that require hospital admission.​[[1]](#c0093n00021)

A prospective CDC cohort study of patients hospitalized with CAP revealed that a causative organism was detected in only about 40% of patients. Of those, viruses were detected in about 25% and bacteria in about 10%.​[[3]](#JainSSelfWHWunderinkRGEtAlCommunit-A4FADD8C) The most common pathogens detected were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%) and S. pneumoniae (in 5%).​[[3]](#JainSSelfWHWunderinkRGEtAlCommunit-A4FADD8C) During the COVID-19 pandemic, bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection was rarely reported (approximately 7% of cases).​[[4]](#Langford_CMI)

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is an uncommon and often forgotten cause of pneumonia. Consider M. tuberculosis particularly in those with nonresolving pneumonia who are born outside of Canada, have HIV or other immune deficiencies, or are residents of long-term care facilities. People in poor housing, crowded conditions and with limited access to good nutrition may also be at higher risk. This includes those from First Nations communities. Also consider tuberculosis in patients who do not respond to treatment (see Tuberculosis).

This chapter discusses the diagnosis and treatment of CAP in adults; discussion related to pediatric cases is outside the scope of this chapter.

**Table 1:** Pathogens in Community-Acquired Pneumonia​​[[a]](#afn17272)

| Streptococcus pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Chlamydophila pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis Legionella spp. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (uncommon) Gram-negative bacilli, e.g., Escherichia coli , Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp. , Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Influenza A and B adenovirus coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2) parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus human metapneumovirus fungi (uncommon) |

[a] May be mixed or polymicrobial in etiology, e.g., viral *plus* bacterial.

### Goals of Therapy

- Assess severity of pneumonia to determine appropriate initial treatment setting
- Relieve symptoms such as cough, pleuritic chest pain, sputum production and/or dyspnea
- Prevent morbidity (respiratory failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, empyema, pulmonary abscess, pneumothorax, sepsis, septic shock, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [SIADH], immobility-related complications)
- Prevent transmission
- Prevent recurrence

### Investigations

- History and physical examination with particular attention to:

  - symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, sputum production, fever, chills, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, new-onset confusion (may be common in older patients)
  - history of recent travel, including travel to regions that have pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory infections, should be considered. Other risk factors for pneumonia include tobacco smoking, exposure to second-hand smoke, excessive alcohol ingestion, removal of wild rodent excrement (associated with hantavirus), hobbies such as exploring old caves (associated with histoplasmosis), cats/animals farms (associated with Q fever), recent loss of consciousness (associated with aspiration), comorbid illnesses; some of these risk factors may prolong recovery
  - physical findings: general appearance, e.g., respiratory distress, being unwell or chronically ill or acutely ill, crackles, wheezes, findings of consolidation of pulmonary tissue (dullness to percussion, increased tactile and vocal fremitus, bronchial breathing, whispered pectoriloquy), pleural friction rub, altered mental status
- Objective measurements:

  - vital signs: respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute is the most sensitive and specific sign of severe pneumonia in adults; in those <50 years of age, a respiratory rate ≥25 may be indicative of severe pneumonia
  - temperature: check patients with ongoing fever (oral temperature >37.5°C), slow resolution or progression of symptoms with a repeat chest radiograph for empyema
  - oxygenation status: in all patients with CAP presenting to the emergency department, measure oxygen saturation; if oxygen saturation <92% in a COPD patient, perform arterial blood gas
  - chest radiograph: posterior-anterior and lateral views; consider a CT scan of the chest in those who have a negative chest radiograph when pneumonia is clinically suspected
    - radiological changes consistent with CAP may in fact be related to COVID-19​[[5]](#Guan_NEJM)
    - consider follow-up chest radiographs for all patients >50 years of age, particularly if the patient smokes. Anywhere from 1–2% of all patients with CAP will have lung cancer and in half of these, the cancer is not diagnosed on the initial radiograph.​[[6]](#c0093n00548)​[[7]](#c0093n00549)​[[8]](#ShepshelovichDGoldvaserHEdelYEtAlH-A5005E1E) Perform follow-up chest radiograph 6–12 weeks after presentation. If the pneumonic opacity is still present, further investigation such as bronchoscopy may be warranted
- Laboratory tests for hospitalized patients:

  - electrolytes, glucose, urea, creatinine, CBC and differential WBC count
  - sputum and blood cultures should be limited to patients with severe CAP or inpatients with risk of MRSA or *Pseudomonas*. Special requests, such as culture for M. tuberculosis, Legionella and fungi such as Blastomyces dermatitidis or Cryptococcus, are dictated by the clinical setting; consult a microbiologist
  - MRSA nasal swab can be considered to assess MRSA colonization status and need for ongoing MRSA empiric coverage. Given the high negative predictive value of a negative MRSA nasal swab, consider stopping vancomycin for MRSA coverage for pneumonia when a nasal swab is negative​[[9]](#MRSAnasal1)​[[10]](#MRSAnasal2)
  - pneumococcal urine antigen testing should be limited to severe CAP
  - urine for *Legionella* antigen if high clinical suspicion for legionnaires disease or for patients who require ICU admission because of progressive pneumonia; if available, use polymerase chain reaction test on sputum or other respiratory secretions that can amplify DNA of all Legionella species
  - an HIV test may be considered where risk is increased
  - consider reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for influenza and other circulating viral respiratory pathogens
  - consider nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) as dictated by clinical setting, e.g., suspected M. pneumoniae pneumonia. If legionnaires disease is suspected (e.g., when there is an epidemiologic link to an outbreak), consider Legionella respiratory secretion culture, Legionella urinary antigen test (only detects Legionella serogroup 1) or NAAT. Hantavirus infection and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) are best diagnosed serologically
  - for patients admitted to hospital and who undergo bronchoalveolar lavage in addition to routine testing samples, some laboratories have the capacity to use nucleic acid amplification tests to detect nucleic acid of Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses

### Assessment of Illness Severity

Several scores designed to predict either death or admission to ICU can be used. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI; see [Table 2](#c0093n00388)) was one of the first to be adopted and was designed to predict 30-day mortality rates among patients with CAP and to help decide admission for hospitalization.​[[11]](#c0093n00403)​[[12]](#c0093n00404) If the score is ≤90, the recommendation is to treat as an outpatient; however, some patients in this category may require hospital admission. If the PSI is ≥91, the recommendation is to treat in hospital. However, clinician judgment is paramount in the assessment of any patient and should always override any scoring system.

**Table 2:** Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)

| Category | Patient Characteristics | Points Assigned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demographic factors | Male​ [a] Female​ [a] Nursing home resident | age (years) age (years) minus 10 10 |
| Comorbid illness | Neoplastic disease Liver disease Heart failure Cerebrovascular disease Renal disease | 30 20 10 10 10 |
| Physical examination findings | Altered mental status Respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg Temperature <35°C or ≥40°C Pulse ≥125 beats/min | 20 20 20 15 10 |
| Laboratory findings | Arterial pH <7.35 Blood urea nitrogen >11 mmol/L Sodium <130 mmol/L Glucose ≥14 mmol/L Hematocrit <30% Partial pressure of arterial oxygen <60 mmHg Pleural effusion | 30 20 20 10 10 10 10 |

[a] CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. The terms “male” and “female” are used in this table per the scoring system developed by the cited authors. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

The CURB-65 score predicts risk of death and assigns 1 point for each of the following:

- New onset confusion
- Urea >7 mmol/L
- Respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute
- Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≤60 mmHg
- ≥65 years of age

Scores range from 0.6% mortality (0 points) to 57% mortality (5 points).​[[13]](#c0093n00508)​[[14]](#c0093n00509)​[[15]](#c0093n00510)

The CRB-65, a variant of the CURB-65 score, includes the components of the CURB-65, with the exception of urea; a recent meta-analysis demonstrated accuracy and discrimination of the decision support tool, providing evidence to support the CRB-65 score.​[[16]](#Ebell-A33FE301)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

Successful management of pneumonia is based on an accurate assessment of illness severity (see [Table 2](#c0093n00388)) and selection of the most appropriate site for treatment.​[[17]](#c0093n00022)

### Empiric Therapy

The evidence for empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials is limited. Review of a cluster randomized controlled trial suggests that for CAP of moderate severity, there is no difference between **beta-lactam** alone, **macrolide and beta-lactam**, or **fluoroquinolone** therapy.​[[18]](#PostmaDFVanWerkhovenCHVanEldenLJEtA-A4FD8503) A systematic review showed no difference between macrolides and fluoroquinolones but fewer adverse events with clarithromycin than erythromycin.​[[19]](#PakhaleSEtAlAntibioticsForCommuni-A4FD974E) Another review showed no difference between macrolides and fluoroquinolones for death.​[[20]](#SkalskyKEtAlMacrolidesVsQuinolon-A4FD998C)

For outpatients, amoxicillin as a first choice or either amoxicillin/​clavulanate or doxycycline as second choice are reasonable and supported by international recommendations.​[[21]](#LimWSEtAlBritishThoracicSocietyC-A4FD9BCE)​[[22]](#Eliakim-RazNEtAlEmpiricAntibiotic-A4FDA063) A third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) in combination with azithromycin or clarithromycin is a rational empiric regimen for severe pneumonia. However, it should be noted that macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) and fluoroquinolones may cause QT interval prolongation; caution is advised.​[[23]](#InBriefFDAAzithromycinWarninMedLe-A4FD9E71)​[[24]](#USFDAAzithro)​[[25]](#USFDAClarithro)

Systematic review evidence for inpatients showed no difference between macrolides and fluoroquinolones for death​[[27]](#AsadiLSliglWIEurichDTEtAlMacrolide-A4FEDBAB) and no difference for death whether or not atypical coverage was used.​[[22]](#Eliakim-RazNEtAlEmpiricAntibiotic-A4FDA063) In order to reduce increasing fluoroquinolone resistance and prevent adverse events (e.g., QTC interval prolongation​[[26]](#USFoodAndDrugAdministrationFDANew-A666E423), tendonitis, tendinopathy or tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, neuropsychiatric effects​[[28]](#HealthCanadaSummarySafetyReview-Fl-A666E1CC)), use of a respiratory fluoroquinolone should be reserved for when cephalosporins or penicillins cannot be used. Piperacillin/​tazobactam should be used only for severe pneumonia or in patients at high risk for resistant pathogens, e.g., P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa risk factors include prior respiratory isolation of *P. aeruginosa* or recent hospitalization and receipt of parenteral antibiotics (in the past 90 days).​[[17]](#c0093n00022)

If etiology is established (see [Table 3](#c0093n00018)), tailor the antibiotic and/or antifungal therapy based on culture and sensitivity results as well as local susceptibility patterns of bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae) and local epidemiologic patterns (e.g., outbreaks or endemic foci of *Legionella* species and dimorphic fungi such as *Blastomyces* and *Histoplasma*). Antibiotics used in the treatment of CAP are described in [Table 4](#c0093n00020).

**Table 3:** Antibiotic Therapy for Community-Acquired Pneumonia caused by Specific Pathogens​​[[a]](#afn13982)[[17]](#c0093n00022)

| Organism | Recommended Antibiotics |
| --- | --- |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae | Penicillin susceptible (MIC <2 mg/L) Initial therapy: penicillin G , amoxicillin Alternatives: macrolide, IV cephalosporins ( ceftriaxone , cefotaxime ), doxycycline , respiratory fluoroquinolones ​ [c] Penicillin resistant (MIC ≥2 mg/L) Initial therapy: cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, respiratory fluoroquinolone​ [c] Alternatives: vancomycin , linezolid ,​ [b] high-dose amoxicillin ( 3 g/day for penicillin MIC ≤4 mg/L) |
| Haemophilus influenzae | Second- or third-generation cephalosporin, amoxicillin /​ clavulanate , fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, azithromycin , clarithromycin ; amoxicillin monotherapy if non-beta-lactamase producing |
| Staphylococcus aureus | Methicillin-susceptible (MSSA): cloxacillin , cefazolin Methicillin-resistant (MRSA): vancomycin, linezolid​ [b] Do not use daptomycin in MRSA or any other pneumonia, as it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant​ [29] |
| Legionella species (legionnaires disease) | Fluoroquinolones or azithromycin; alternative: doxycycline |
| Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydophila pneumoniae | Macrolides or doxycycline; alternative: fluoroquinolones |
| Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) | Doxycycline or fluoroquinolones |
| Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Ceftazidime, piperacillin /​ tazobactam , meropenem ,​ [b] ciprofloxacin |

[a] Delafloxacin (approved but not yet available in Canada) and ceftobiprole​[[b]](#afn59890) are newer antibiotics approved for CAP; however, their use should be reserved for cases where other agents are inappropriate and, if selected, used in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist.

[b] This medication should be used only in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist as it is listed on Health Canada’s “[Reserve list for antimicrobial drugs](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/reserve-list-antimicrobial.html).”

[c] Respiratory fluoroquinolones: levofloxacin, moxifloxacin.

### Duration of Antibiotic Therapy

For patients who are well enough to be treated on an ambulatory basis, a minimum of 5 days of antibiotic therapy is required.​[[17]](#c0093n00022) Patients who are hospitalized, who respond to treatment within 48 hours and who have no complications may be treated for 5–7 days; 5 days of therapy is recommended if patient is afebrile for 48 hours and has no more than 1 sign of clinical instability.​[[17]](#c0093n00022) Repeat chest x-ray is not necessary if there is clinical resolution and if the patient is <50 years of age. Specific etiologies may require longer treatment, such as 21 days for severe legionnaires disease and 7–10 days for pneumonia caused by bacteremic aerobic gram-negative bacilli and P. aeruginosa.​[[1]](#c0093n00021) Empyema requires drainage and treatment for 14 days or longer. Prolonged therapy is necessary when a lung abscess complicates pneumonia, e.g., until the cavity has closed, a process that may take 12–16 weeks.

### Aspiration Pneumonia

Aspiration pneumonia denotes 2 distinct clinical entities. The first is aspiration pneumonitis, which is aspiration of gastric contents (usually sterile as long as there is gastric acid present) into the lungs with a resultant inflammatory response. The second is aspiration pneumonia resulting from the aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lung with resultant bacterial infection. Risk factors for aspiration include altered level of consciousness, incompetent gastroesophageal junction, elevated intragastric pressure or volume, impaired swallowing mechanisms secondary to neurologic diseases, and interference of glottic closure due to neuromuscular diseases.​[[30]](#c0093n00463)

Generally, younger patients aspirate due to altered level of consciousness (seizures, drugs, alcohol) and older patients aspirate due to neurologic diseases that affect the swallowing mechanism. Patients with aspiration pneumonia require admission to an ICU more commonly than those with CAP due to other causes.​[[31]](#c0093n00464)

Aspiration pneumonitis does not require antibiotic therapy. For suspected aspiration pneumonia, routinely adding anaerobic coverage is not recommended; anaerobes should be covered only if lung abscess or empyema is suspected. Aspiration pneumonia should be treated similar to CAP.

### Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia​[[32]](#c0093n00406)

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), an uncommon yet serious cause of CAP, accounts for 1–5% of cases. MRSA pneumonia is more common in patients with severe pneumonia who require treatment in an ICU and among residents in long-term care facilities. S. aureus, both MSSA and MRSA, is about the third most frequent cause of bacteremic pneumonia in the community.

S. aureus pneumonia has classically been described as a secondary bacterial pathogen in the setting of a primary influenza virus upper respiratory tract infection.​[[33]](#c0093n00438)​[[34]](#c0093n00439)​[[35]](#c0093n00440) In the setting of bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia, exclude endocarditis (often right sided), especially if multiple rounded opacities are present on the chest radiograph (septic emboli). More recently, community-acquired MRSA infections have been caused by strains known to be associated with tissue necrosis.​[[36]](#c0093n00441)​[[37]](#c0093n00442) Vancomycin and linezolid are effective choices for these strains;​[[38]](#c0093n00407) however, linezolid should be used only in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist, as it is listed on Health Canada’s “[Reserve list for antimicrobial drugs](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/reserve-list-antimicrobial.html).”

Do not use daptomycin in MRSA or any other pneumonia, as it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant.​[[29]](#c0093n00454)

### Corticosteroids

A meta-analysis of moderate-quality trials studying hospitalized patients treated with oral or IV corticosteroids found a reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with severe pneumonia.​[[39]](#SiemieniukRAMeadeMOAlonso-CoelloPEt-8DC2A65F) Patients treated with corticosteroids were less likely to require mechanical ventilation or to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additional benefits included shorter time to clinical stability and shorter hospital stay. Predictably, patients who received corticosteroids were more likely to have elevated blood glucose requiring treatment. No difference was seen in the rate of GI hemorrhage between corticosteroid-treated and placebo patients. In a Cochrane review, corticosteroid therapy was reported to reduce death and morbidity in adults with severe CAP, but death was not reduced in nonsevere CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, but the harm did not seem to outweigh the benefits.​[[40]](#Stern-A34E55C1) In an individual patient data meta-analysis, adjunct corticosteroids for patients hospitalized with CAP reduced time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay by approximately 1 day without a significant effect on overall mortality; an increased risk for CAP-related rehospitalization and hyperglycemia was observed. However, data from 3 clinical trials that reported reductions in mortality were not available for the meta-analysis.​[[41]](#BrielM-A34E59E7)

In summary, for hospitalized patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, as defined by validated scales (see [Assessment of Illness Severity](#c0093n00558)) and clinical judgment, administration of adjunctive corticosteroids could be considered to reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of mechanical ventilation and ARDS.​[[39]](#SiemieniukRAMeadeMOAlonso-CoelloPEt-8DC2A65F) Corticosteroid regimens in the meta-analysis included prednisone 50 mg daily PO for 7 days, methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg BID IV for 5 days and dexamethasone 5 mg daily IV for 4 days. The ideal regimen has not been determined.

### Influenza Pneumonia

Groups at high risk for complications include older adults, patients with comorbidities or morbid obesity, pregnant patients, and Indigenous persons.​[[42]](#c0093n00506) Studies from autopsy specimens of deaths from pH1N1 revealed that bacteria (S. pneumonia, Group A Streptococcus, S. aureus) were present in over 55% of cases, of which S. aureus was a secondary pathogen in 40% and pneumococcus in 35% of cases.​[[43]](#c0093n00507)​[[44]](#c0093n00478) Current recommendations for treatment of influenza A or B virus infection include the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (see Influenza for more information).

### COVID-19 Pneumonia

Bacterial co-infection is relatively rare in patients with COVID-19;​[[4]](#Langford_CMI) therefore, antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed in patients with mild or moderate cases. For severe COVID-19, empiric agents should be considered only if bacterial co-infection is strongly suspected.​[[45]](#ONT_COVID) Antibiotic use should be judicious, with a re-assessment after 3–5 days for de-escalation and/or optimization (see: COVID-19 for further information).

### Prevention of Community-Acquired Pneumonia

### Vaccines

### Influenza Vaccine

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for anyone >6 months of age who wants to avoid developing influenza, especially those at high risk of complications from influenza.​[[46]](#c0093n00410) Previous studies have reported that immunization of older patients reduced the rate of admission to hospital for both pneumonia and heart failure,​[[47]](#c0093n00411) hospitalized patients with CAP demonstrated improved survival from prior vaccination,​[[48]](#c0093n00412) and immunization of health-care workers against influenza reduced the mortality rate due to influenza in patients.​[[49]](#c0093n00413) Although these studies demonstrated benefit, later evidence suggested that the beneficial effects of influenza vaccine may have been overestimated because of confounding, i.e., a “healthy-user effect”; a 51% reduction in mortality with influenza vaccination was observed in patients who developed CAP outside the influenza season ​[[50]](#c0093n00469) (for further information, see: Influenza). Cluster randomized trial data suggest that immunizing health-care workers reduces morbidity and mortality in patients,​[[51]](#c0093n00568)​[[52]](#c0093n00567)​[[53]](#c0093n00566)​[[54]](#c0093n00565) although a Cochrane review concluded otherwise ​[[55]](#c0093n00470) (see Influenza). A randomized controlled trial in patients with heart failure showed that influenza vaccine reduced pneumonia by 40%.​[[56]](#iVax_reduce_vascular)

### Pneumococcal Vaccine

Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are available in Canada—polysaccharide and conjugate (polysaccharide conjugated to a protein carrier to enhance immunogenicity). The only available polysaccharide vaccine is a 23-valent vaccine (Pneu-P-23), the vaccine with the most serotypes; however, its immune response is short-lived (approximately 5 y).​[[57]](#CIG_Pneumo) Numerous conjugate vaccines are approved in Canada, each with increasing coverage of S. pneumoniae serotypes (e.g., Pneu-C-10, Pneu-C-13, Pneu-C-15, Pneu-C-20, Pneu-C-21).​[[57]](#CIG_Pneumo) The Pneu-C-20 and Pneu-C-21 vaccines offer coverage of the majority S. pneumoniae serotypes in Pneu-P-23, with the added benefit of longer duration of immunogenicity, which may potentially be lifelong.​[[57]](#CIG_Pneumo) Conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are also used in the routine immunization of children, which, because of community protection (i.e., herd immunity), has decreased (but not eliminated) invasive pneumococcal disease among adults.​[[58]](#c0093n00415)

Clinical trial results for pneumococcal vaccines are as follows:

- Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (e.g., Pneu-P-23) were shown to be effective in preventing pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia​[[59]](#c0093n00512) and reducing ICU admission and mortality in hospitalized patients;​[[60]](#c0093n00458) however, the evidence for prevention of all-cause pneumonia in high-income countries\ is weak.​[[59]](#c0093n00512) Furthermore, as mentioned above, the antibody concentrations of this vaccine begin to decline after 5 years.
- A large randomized controlled trial comparing Pneu-C-13 to placebo in patients ≥65 years of age showed a reduction in pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumococcal CAP.​[[61]](#Bonten-A34FCAEA)
- In a clinical trial evaluating immunogenicity, Pneu-C-15 was shown to be noninferior to Pneu-C-13.​[[62]](#Platt-7197E1A9)
- In a clinical trial evaluating immunogenicity,  Pneu-C-20 was shown to be noninferior to the combination of Pneu-C-13 followed by Pneu-P-23 1 month later (the standard of care at the time).​[[63]](#Essink-719809E6)
- Two clinical trials have compared the immunogenicity of Pneu-C-21 to Pneu-C-15, Pneu-C-20 and Pneu-P-23; all demonstrated that Pneu-C-21 was noninferior to the other vaccines.​[[62]](#Platt-7197E1A9)​[[64]](#Scott-71982FF3)

Current Canadian recommendations are to provide **Pneu-C-20** or **Pneu-C-21** to all adults. In those who have already been vaccinated with Pneu-C-13, Pneu-C-15 or Pneu-P-23, a dose of Pneu-C-20 or Pneu-C-21 is recommended if the individual is: ​[[65]](#NACI_Pneu-C-21)

- ≥65 years of age
- <65 years of age with risk factors that increase their risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), e.g., long-term care resident; immunocompromising conditions or medications; chronic lung, heart, liver or kidney disease; diabetes mellitus; cochlear implants; tobacco, alcohol or substance use disorder (for more information, see [Table 1](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-16-pneumococcal-vaccine.html#a3) of the Canadian Immunization Guide’s (CIG) [pneumococcal vaccines chapter](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-16-pneumococcal-vaccine.html)).

A 1–year gap is recommended between the administration of the older pneumococcal vaccine (e.g., Pneu-C-13, Pneu-C-15, Pneu-P-23) and the newer pneumococcal vaccine (e.g., Pneu-C-20, Pneu-C-21).​[[65]](#NACI_Pneu-C-21) However, in some immunocompromised individuals, an ≥8 week interval may be appropriate (see the CIG's [pneumococcal vaccines chapter](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-16-pneumococcal-vaccine.html) for more information).

Other pneumococcal vaccines that are approved in Canada but are no longer recommended for routine use in adults include Pneu-C-10, Pneu-C-13, Pneu-C-15 and Pneu-P-23.​[[65]](#NACI_Pneu-C-21)

### Smoking Cessation

Encourage smoking cessation (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). Tobacco smoking is associated with a 2-fold increase in risk for invasive pneumococcal pneumonia.​[[66]](#c0093n00408) It is likely that cessation of tobacco smoking will reduce the rate of pneumonia, but there are no data from clinical trials. Nevertheless, this recommendation is likely to have many benefits, including slowing the age-related decline in lung function and reducing the risk of lung cancer. Second-hand smoke is a risk factor for pneumonia in patients living with a person who smokes.​[[67]](#AlmirallJSerra-PratMBolxedbarIEtAl-A4FFD7BC)

### Prevention of Aspiration Pneumonia

For patients at risk of aspiration, the “chin down” posture may reduce the occurrence of aspiration both before and during the swallow; however, definitive evidence is lacking.​[[68]](#c0093n00513) This posture results in a posterior shift of the anterior pharyngeal structures, narrowing the laryngeal entrance while widening the angle of the epiglottis to the anterior tracheal wall. The end result is protection of the airway. Cleaning of the teeth and gingiva by caregivers after each meal reduced the latency time of the swallowing reflex and increased substance P in the saliva of patients with dysphagia due to cerebrovascular disease.​[[69]](#c0093n00569) Substance P stimulates the neural pathways to improve the swallowing reflex. Elevation of the head of the bed is also helpful in preventing aspiration pneumonia.

CAP in pregnancy is not uncommon, accounting for about 4% of antepartum hospitalizations for nonobstetric complications.​[[70]](#c0093n00520) It is believed that CAP poses a disproportionate burden of illness in pregnant patients and should be promptly diagnosed and treated.​[[71]](#c0093n00521) If left untreated, pneumonia in pregnancy can cause life-threatening disease to the patient and adverse effects to the infant, e.g., preterm birth and low birth weight.

### Management of CAP in Pregnant Patients

Clinical presentation of CAP is similar to nonpregnant patients. Perform a chest radiograph in patients for whom CAP is suspected. In healthy pregnant patients with no recent antibiotic exposure, use of high-dose amoxicillin is recommended.

Treat pregnant patients with severe CAP with a beta-lactam and a macrolide.​[[17]](#c0093n00022) Erythromycin is the preferred macrolide in pregnancy,​[[72]](#Muand-0B51290E) but it is not currently available in Canada; azithromycin has been shown to be safe in pregnancy and is a suitable alternative.​[[73]](#Briggs) Amoxicillin is the preferred beta-lactam; ceftriaxone is an alternative. Ideally, local macrolide and beta-lactam resistance rates should be available to tailor the regimen. Should a resistant pathogen be suspected, infectious disease consultation is recommended.

In most patients, there will be clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, and therapy should not be changed in the first 72 hours unless there is marked clinical deterioration.​[[71]](#c0093n00521) Fever should resolve in 2–4 days and cough after 7–10 days. Radiologic abnormalities may persist for up to 6 weeks, so continued hospitalization is not required to await radiologic improvement. Therapy is recommended for a minimum of 5 days for uncomplicated CAP. Treatment failures may be encountered in up to 15% of cases; choose a broad-spectrum regimen or more specific treatment if the infecting agent is identified.

### Management of CAP in Breastfeeding Patients

The antimicrobials recommended in pregnancy (see [Management of CAP in Pregnant Patients](#c0093n00516)), including those for MRSA, are considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[[74]](#c0093n00523)​[[75]](#c0093n00524)

### Prevention of CAP in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Patients

Pregnant patients should be immunized against influenza because of the high risk of complications. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for pregnant patients with conditions placing them at higher risk of pneumococcal disease, i.e., immunosuppression; cigarette smoking; alcohol use disorder; diabetes; cardiac, pulmonary or renal disease; or asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease). The COVID-19 vaccination is safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should be offered vaccination against COVID-19 (primary series and/or booster doses) at any time during pregnancy if they are eligible and no other contraindications exist. Primary prevention strategies such as handwashing and limiting contact with sick individuals reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- For empiric therapy, administer an agent from a different therapeutic class if the patient has received antibiotics within the 3 months prior to diagnosis of CAP.
- Because of its lowered activity against H. influenzae, erythromycin monotherapy is not routinely recommended in patients with COPD.
- In the outpatient setting, the superiority of one agent over another is difficult to define because most of the randomized, controlled trials are noninferiority studies conducted for licensing purposes.
- Evidence from 1 randomized controlled trial suggests that early mobilization during management of CAP can reduce length of stay.​[[76]](#c0093n00526)
- Despite the recommendation from various guidelines for empiric coverage of atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients, there is no evidence that regimens that include atypical coverage result in better outcomes than those that do not.​[[77]](#c0093n00525)
- In patients receiving parenteral therapy, consider switching to oral antibiotics when the following criteria are met:​[[17]](#c0093n00022)​[[78]](#c0093n00418)​[[79]](#c0093n00419)
  - GI tract is functioning normally, e.g., no vomiting, diarrhea or disorder compromising GI absorption
  - hemodynamically stable
  - 2 temperature readings are normal (oral temperature <37.5°C) over a period of 16 hours in previously febrile patients
  - normalized white blood cell count
  - subjective improvement in cough and shortness of breath
  - able to consume oral medicationsIf blood cultures are positive, the duration of IV therapy is dictated by the organism recovered from the blood. Use of clinical pathways that emphasize early antibiotic switch and early mobilization may reduce lengths of hospital stay.​[[80]](#c0093n00553)
- Discharge the patient when the following criteria are met in addition to those above:

  - absence of complications from the pneumonia, e.g., empyema
  - absence of complications from comorbid illnesses, e.g., MI
  - absence of complications from treatment, e.g., severe adverse drug reactions
  - physiological stability: oxygen saturation of ≥92% while breathing room air for those who do not have COPD (for patients with COPD, a return to baseline status is desirable), pulse rate of <100 beats/minute and respiratory rate ≤24 breaths/minute​[[17]](#c0093n00022)
- Prevent recurrent pneumonia in patients ≥65 years of age and in those suffering from recurrent episodes. A checklist that includes identification of causes of aspiration and measures to prevent recurrent aspiration may be useful.
- Review pneumococcal and influenza vaccine status and immunize if indicated.
