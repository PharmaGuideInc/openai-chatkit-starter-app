### Introduction

This chapter addresses the following bacterial skin infections:

### Superficial skin infections:

**Folliculitis:** Inflammation of superficial or deep hair follicles, producing papules and pustules. Infectious causes include Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (hot tub–associated) and other gram-negative rods. Noninfectious causes may be termed “pseudofolliculitis” and are induced by friction and/or occlusion (e.g., hair removal). A **furuncle (boil)** is an S. aureus–mediated infection of the hair follicle with extension of suppurative material into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Interconnecting multiple furuncles that coalesce into a single purulent mass are termed a **carbuncle**.​[[1]](#Clebak2018)

**Impetigo:** Superficial infection of skin primarily caused by S. aureus (more common) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus), which most often affects young children. Primary impetigo refers to infection of previously healthy skin, while secondary impetigo (also known as **impetiginization**) affects nonintact skin (e.g., abrasions, eczema). Two clinical forms of impetigo include **nonbullous** (S. aureus and/or S. pyogenes), characterized by papules, vesicles and pustules that break down to an adherent “honey-crust” appearance on the face or extremities; and **bullous** (S. aureus-mediated toxin), which presents as fluid-filled vesicles that can evolve into flaccid bullae that rupture to form a thin, brown crust on the trunk. **Ecthyma** is a deeper form of nonbullous impetigo that extends into the dermis, resulting in ulceration and crusting, and is more commonly associated with S. pyogenes than S. aureus.​[[2]](#Hartman2014)

### Skin and soft tissue structure infections:

**Cellulitis:** Acute infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue characterized by poorly circumscribed bright-red erythema, edema, warmth and tenderness. Cellulitis can be categorized into **nonpurulent** (caused predominantly by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or **purulent** (S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] strains). Other less common pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae with buccal (facial) cellulitis (particularly in children not immunized with H. influenzae B (Hib) vaccine), Pasteurella and Capnocytophaga (oral organisms) with animal bites, and Aeromonas and Vibrio with environmental water exposures.​[[3]](#Raff2016)

**Erysipelas:** Acute infection of the upper dermis and lymphatics, occurring most commonly on the face and lower extremities. It is often caused by S. pyogenes; less frequently by S. aureus. Erysipelas is distinguished from cellulitis by more superficial cutaneous and prominent lymphatic involvement, with more sharply delineated, raised margins and dimples around the follicles, described as “*peau d’orange*” (orange peel texture).​[[1]](#Clebak2018) Recurrence occurs in up to 30% of cases.​[[4]](#Inghammar-9129043E)

**Human and animal (dog and cat) bites:** Bite wounds may often lead to superficial soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis with or without abscess. Human bites are associated with human oral flora (e.g., Eikenella, S. pyogenes, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Prevotella), while cat and dog bites are associated with Pasteurella and Capnocytophaga.​[[5]](#c0072n00268) Deeper infections, including septic arthritis, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis and necrotizing infection, should be referred to an infectious diseases physician.

**Cutaneous abscess:** Infection of the dermal or subcutaneous tissues in which a collection of pus is formed without follicular involvement. The most common cause is S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] or -resistant [MRSA] strains); however, polymicrobial infections may also occur.​[[5]](#c0072n00268)

**Necrotizing fasciitis:**

- **Necrotizing fasciitis, type I** (also known as synergistic necrotizing cellulitis, progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene or Fournier gangrene): Rapidly advancing polymicrobial (aerobic and anaerobic bacteria) limb- and life-threatening infection characterized by progressive necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle. Diagnosis is associated with severe pain that exceeds the clinical presentation; early recognition is critical to prevent rapid progression and tissue destruction.​[[6]](#Stevens2017)
- **Necrotizing fasciitis, type II**: Monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis often associated with S. pyogenes or other beta-hemolytic streptococci, and less commonly with Clostridium and S. aureus.​[[6]](#Stevens2017)
- Other rarer forms of necrotizing fasciitis include **type III** (monomicrobial infections with Clostridium or gram-negative bacteria [e.g., Vibrio]) and **type IV** (fungal infections—mainly in immunocompromised hosts).

### Goals of Therapy

- Eradicate the bacterial skin infection
- Alleviate symptoms of the skin infection
- Prevent complications due to progression of disease
- Prevent recurrence of the skin infection by modifying contributing factors

### Investigations

### Differential Diagnosis

- Skin infections are mimicked by numerous noninfectious syndromes; when patients lack hallmark clinical features of infection or have bilateral or atypical findings, clinicians should carefully evaluate the patient to rule out these syndromes and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics:

  - Venous stasis dermatitis: resembles nonpurulent cellulitis, causing an itchy or painful red discoloration of the lower limbs. This common syndrome can be distinguished from infection based on the following: disappearance of the redness with elevation of the legs, the absence of proximal streaking, low inflammatory markers in blood and bilateral presentation.
  - Deep vein thrombosis: a potentially life-threatening mimic of cellulitis. It can be distinguished by the lack of inflammatory markers or proximal streaking, elevated markers of coagulation such as D-dimer, and the presence of pain on stretching of the calf. It is commonly associated with prolonged immobility (e.g., long-haul flight) or in the presence of neoplasms.
  - Herpes zoster: may be confused with both cellulitis or impetigo, especially early in disease. This condition can be distinguished from cellulitis by a prodrome of burning or itching, manifestation in a dermatomal pattern and presence of clustered, clear vesicles (sometimes described as dew-drops on a rose petal). It is also possible for zoster to impetiginize due to a secondary infection. Careful clinical evaluation is necessary to distinguish herpes zoster from these 2 bacterial infections.
  - Gout: may be confused with cellulitis. It generally affects joints and is frequently recurrent or migratory. Sampling of joint fluid is often necessary.
  - Ruptured or inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts (often incorrectly called sebaceous cysts): may appear infected or may resemble an abscess given significant erythema and tenderness; however, only those with secondary cellulitis require antibiotic therapy.
  - Less commonly: contact dermatitis, toxin-mediated disease (e.g., toxic shock syndrome), viral infections (e.g., dengue; hand, foot and mouth disease), vasculitis, arthropod bites or infestations, and erythema migrans (associated with Lyme disease).

### Therapeutic Choices

Information on the management of bacterial skin infections can be found in [Figure 1](#c0072n00006), [Figure 2](#c0072n00005), [Figure 3](#ManagementOfNonpurulentCellulitis-DD11D001), [Figure 4](#ManagementOfPurulentSkinAndSoftTiss-DD11D3EC), [Figure 5](#c0072n00007) and [Figure 6](#BitesFig). Information on specific antibiotic choices can be found in [Table 1](#c0072n00022) and [Table 2](#c0072n00023).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Considerations before treating with pharmacological agents:

- Folliculitis:

  - Address any factors contributing to folliculitis in intertriginous regions and areas of friction by eliminating tight-fitting clothing and reducing friction, moisture and heat.
  - Mild folliculitis (with few pustules) and hot tub folliculitis usually resolve spontaneously without any treatment.
- Impetigo:

  - For primary impetigo or secondarily impetiginized skin, use normal saline or warm water compresses for 10–15 minutes TID–QID to expedite removal of crusts and promote healing.
- Cellulitis:

  - Elevation of affected area helps to reduce edema.
  - Cool, wet compresses can be used to relieve local discomfort.
  - Given the higher recurrence rates for lower-extremity cellulitis, contributing factors (e.g., edema, stasis dermatitis, interdigital tinea pedis) should be identified and treated in all patients.​[[5]](#c0072n00268)
  - Daily compression stocking use in patients with chronic lower extremity edema have been shown to reduce recurrent cellulitis (15% vs. 40%).​[[12]](#Webb-913DC8AB)
- Cutaneous Abscess:

  - In the absence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (e.g., fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukocytosis) or surrounding cellulitis, isolated skin abscesses can be treated with incision and drainage alone, if feasible, even in the setting of MRSA infection.​[[5]](#c0072n00268) Systemic treatment should be reserved for nondrainable abscesses (e.g., areas near the eyes, nose, mouth), surrounding cellulitis or immunocompromised hosts. Routine packing of wounds post-incision and drainage does not appear to influence clinical cure rates and may be considered optional.​[[13]](#ListMHeadleeDKondratukK.TreatmentOf-506728B0)
- Necrotizing fasciitis:

  - If necrotizing infection is suspected, obtain urgent surgical consultation for débridement and infectious diseases consultation for antibiotic choice and follow-up. This is a limb-threatening medical emergency and requires immediate attention from surgical and infectious diseases experts.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Considerations prior to systemic treatment:

- Folliculitis:

  - Topical anti-staphylococcal antibiotic may be considered for patients with limited skin involvement.
- Impetigo/Ecthyma:

  - Topical therapy is effective for limited skin involvement, while oral therapy is recommended when multiple lesions are present; however, ecthyma always requires oral treatment.
- Cellulitis:

  - When patients lack hallmark clinical features of cellulitis (e.g., red, hot, swollen, tender, regional lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, chills), consider noninfectious alternative diagnoses (e.g., stasis dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, vascular causes) before treating with antibiotics.
  - Since nonpurulent cellulitis is usually caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci (e.g., S. pyogenes), empiric coverage of staphylococci is not necessary, unless risk factors for S. aureus or severity of disease dictates use.
  - Purulent cellulitis is caused by S. aureus and should be drained wherever possible; nondrainable abscesses require anti-staphylococcal therapy.
  - Empiric treatment for MRSA in purulent cellulitis should be based on local epidemiology and patient risk factors (e.g., systemic symptoms, MRSA colonization).​[[5]](#c0072n00268) Definitive treatment should be based on cultures taken from purulent areas at the time of diagnosis.
  - In cases of exposure to salt or brackish water, consider covering Aeromonas and Vibrio with dual therapy, including a third-generation cephalosporin and either a tetracycline or fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
  - Erysipelas should be treated with anti-streptococcal therapy.
  - **Note:** any cellulitis or serious soft tissue infection presenting with severe pain that is out of proportion with the clinical appearance, associated with blisters or necrosis, “dusky grey” skin colour, crepitus (from subcutaneous gas), numbness, rapid spread, or systemic toxicity (e.g., fever, hemodynamic instability) should be investigated for necrotizing fasciitis or synergistic gangrene (e.g., Fournier gangrene) and referred as a medical emergency to surgery for débridement.
- Cutaneous abscess:

  - Abscesses should be drained, if possible. Addition of antibiotics after incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses should be considered if the area involved is extensive, if there are associated signs and symptoms of cellulitis, or if comorbidities justify more aggressive treatment.​[[14]](#c0072n00255) Recurrent abscesses at the same site suggest a potentially noninfectious, underlying cause (e.g., hidradenitis suppurativa, pilonidal cyst, foreign body).
  - In select patients with recurrent S. aureus infection, a trial of decolonization may be considered.​[[7]](#SmithCH-914005A4)
- Necrotizing fasciitis:

  - Definitive treatment includes early surgical exploration and aggressive débridement of necrotic tissue. Antibiotics are considered supportive therapy to complement surgical intervention.
  - Suspected necrotizing fasciitis type I (rapid progression, dusky grey appearance, bullae) should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem).
  - Suspected necrotizing fasciitis type II (severe pain not correlating with skin appearance, rapid progression, severe presentation) should include the addition of clindamycin to a beta-lactam antibiotic for S. pyogenes and S. aureus coverage based on its potential *in vitro* anti-toxin activity. Use of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is controversial​[[15]](#Kadri-9140373B)​[[16]](#Madsen-91406EE8)​[[17]](#Peetermans-9140A10B) and not generally recommended.

### Systemic Agents

Information on systemic agents used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections can also be found in [Table 1](#c0072n00022).

Note that for invasive or life-threatening infections and those not responding to treatment, cultures and clinical evaluation must be used to guide specific pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy.

### Beta-lactams

- Oral and intravenous first-generation **cephalosporins** (e.g., oral: cephalexin, cefadroxil, cefprozil; intravenous: cefazolin) are usually first-line agents for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue bacterial infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), including impetigo and nonpurulent and purulent cellulitis where MRSA is considered unlikely. First-generation cephalosporins are preferred over second- or third-generation cephalosporins due to their narrower spectrum of coverage and limited collateral damage to the microbiome.
- An alternative beta-lactam agent is cloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin; although its use is limited by poor oral bioavailability, limited activity (covers primarily S. aureus) and need for frequent (i.e., Q6H) dosing.
- **Penicillin** is the treatment of choice for streptococcal infections (e.g., erysipelas) but should not be used empirically as monotherapy for infections where S. aureus is suspected, given high rates of resistance to penicillin. In the setting of cellulitis, purulence or cutaneous abscess that suggests the presence of S. aureus, empiric coverage of MRSA may be appropriate based on local rates or patient risk factors.​[[14]](#c0072n00255)
- Amoxicillin/​clavulanate is the treatment of choice for human or animal bites (e.g., cat, dog). Alternate regimens should cover *Staphylococcus*, *Streptococcus*, fastidious gram-negative organisms (Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga) and mouth anaerobes.

  *Note*: Second-line options for animal bites include combination therapy with metronidazole *plus* one of either a second- (e.g., cefuroxime) or third-generation **cephalosporin** (e.g., ceftriaxone) or doxycycline.​[[5]](#c0072n00268)​[[18]](#c0072n00264) P. multocida is commonly present in animal bites and is resistant to cloxacillin, first-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin and macrolides.
- Piperacillin/​tazobactam (beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor) and meropenem (carbapenem) are broad-spectrum antibiotics used in empiric or directed therapy for severe polymicrobial infections (i.e., necrotizing fasciitis type I infections). Meropenem should be reserved for patients with a history of multi-drug resistance or when multi-drug resistant pathogens are suspected or documented.

### Penicillin allergy

Penicillin allergy is reported in 10% of the population, however less than 1% are truly allergic.​[[19]](#Shenoy2019) Cross-reactivity with cephalosporins is based on similarities in the side-chain between antibiotics, not the beta-lactam ring structure. Patients with minor delayed reactions (e.g., rash without hives) have low risk of experiencing adverse events with cephalosporins (approximately 1%).​[[20]](#c0072n00261)​[[21]](#TericoATGallagherJC.Beta-lactamHype-D3369649) Patients with type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, hives) may receive cephalosporins that do not share side-chains with the offending beta-lactam antibiotic,​[[22]](#BugsDrugs) with close monitoring of the first dose. Patients describing severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to any beta-lactam antibiotic should not receive any class of beta-lactam antibiotics due to potential life-threatening reactions.

### Lincosamides

- Clindamycin is a third-line agent for treating skin and soft tissue infections caused by staphylococci or streptococci in penicillin-allergic patients who do not tolerate cephalosporins. Recent data suggest S. aureus and S. pyogenes resistance rates of up to 30%,​[[23]](#lifelabs) so consideration for use should be based on local susceptibilities or definitive culture results. Clindamycin has been associated with an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and pseudomembranous colitis.
- For community-acquired MRSA, clindamycin may be considered as an option; however, there has been an increase in resistance, so local epidemiology should be considered or treatment should be based on culture results.​[[14]](#c0072n00255)

### Oxazolidinones

- Linezolid has broad gram-positive activity against streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci. It is mainly used for MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) coverage. Both oral and IV formulations have similar bioavailability, i.e., 100%.
- For MRSA, linezolid may be used as an alternate agent when other anti-MRSA agents (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, doxycycline, clindamycin, vancomycin IV) cannot be used.

### Sulfonamides

Sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim should be considered when MRSA skin infection is suspected or documented; however, this drug does not cover streptococci effectively. Additional coverage should be considered if streptococci are suspected.

### Tetracyclines

**Tetracyclines** (e.g., doxycycline) cover both streptococci and staphylococci, including MRSA. These drugs are less studied, but appear to be effective for minor infections when used in conjunction with abscess drainage and other interventions.

### Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolones use should be limited when treating common bacterial skin infections, unless gram-negative organisms are suspected. Ciprofloxacin can be used to treat *Pseudomonas* or hot tub folliculitis in select patients with extensive or symptomatic involvement, or in those who are severely immunocompromised; however, the condition is often self-limiting in untreated patients.

### Topical Agents

Topical agents should not be used to treat an infection that exceeds the immediate area surrounding a wound or lesion. Topical agents may have a role in preventing infection; however, good wound care is probably as effective and less likely to induce toxicity or resistance. If used, topical agents should be used sparingly and for a limited period of time.

Information on topical agents used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections can be found in [Table 2](#c0072n00023).

Mupirocin is an effective topical antibiotic for localized treatment of impetigo and folliculitis caused by S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Applied intranasally, it can be used to eradicate S. aureus nasal carriage as part of a decolonization protocol (see [Figure 2](#c0072n00005)).​[[24]](#c0072n00025) Resistance rates to mupirocin in MRSA have been increasing and are linked with prior exposure to the drug.​[[24]](#c0072n00025)

Fusidic acid is another topical antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Due to reports of increasing resistance of S. aureus to fusidic acid, the drug should be used only for a defined treatment course and not for reducing the colonization of wounds at risk for infection.​[[25]](#PfallerMACastanheiraMSaderHSEtAl.Ev-95F32E04)

Ozenoxacin is a topical nonfluorinated quinolone with activity against S. aureus (including MRSA) and S. pyogenes.​[[26]](#GropperSAlbaredaNCheliusKEtAl.Ozeno-5BCC0D81) It is indicated only for the treatment of impetigo. There are no studies comparing effectiveness of ozenoxacin to that of other topical antibiotics used in Canada to treat localized impetigo.

Numerous nonprescription proprietary preparations containing antibiotics with both gram-positive and -negative coverage are available (e.g., **bacitracin**, **gramicidin**, **polymyxin B**). These agents have limited clinical studies for bacterial skin infections.​[[24]](#c0072n00025) Bacitracin use has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis.​[[27]](#BatesB.ContactDermatitisTreatmentMa-98052455)

**Silver sulfadiazine** was previously believed to play a role in reducing microbes in wounds and burns; however, there are some reports that suggest a risk of delayed wound healing associated with silver sulfadiazine such that alternative wound regimens should be considered when feasible.​[[28]](#c0072n00206)

### Prevention

Infection-control practices are important in preventing the spread of confirmed S. aureus or MRSA skin infections in either the patient or to a family member. General measures, such as covering of any exposed wounds or lesions, not sharing personal items, avoiding contact with bandages or wounds of infected individuals, and regular handwashing can help to reduce the risk of transmission.

Prophylaxis using low-dose beta-lactams for cellulitis is controversial. If considered, it should be used only for those with numerous recurrences, since the protective effect is diminished with discontinuation of prophylaxis.​[[29]](#c0072n00257)​[[30]](#c0072n00269)

Patients with invasive group A streptococcal infections (e.g., associated with bacteremia or necrotizing fasciitis) must be reported to Public Health. Prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated in close contacts.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Skin Infections and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Indications and treatment principles for bacterial skin infections in pregnancy are similar to those for nonpregnant patients, with avoidance of oral or IV antimicrobials known to have teratogenic risk. Pregnancy may exacerbate frictional folliculitis due to weight gain.

### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

Patients considering conception should discontinue potentially teratogenic antibiotics (e.g., sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline) unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Advise patients with recurrent folliculitis of unknown origin to obtain bacterial swabs to rule out community-acquired MRSA, as its presence would require appropriate counselling for management during pregnancy. Ensure preventative strategies are optimized for patients with underlying skin disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis) who are prone to secondary skin infections.

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

Beta-lactams are generally considered safe in pregnancy and are first-line for most skin and soft tissue infections.

For confirmed bacterial infections requiring systemic antibacterial agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin and erythromycin (with the exception of the estolate salt) can all be used safely during pregnancy.​[[31]](#c0072n00197)​[[32]](#c0072n00198) **Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim** should be avoided in the first trimester due to risks of neural tube defects and avoided in the last month due to risk of kernicterus after delivery.​[[33]](#c0072n00258)

There is limited data available on safety of topical antibiotics in pregnancy. Mupirocin is not expected to pose any risk to the fetus based on animal data and its limited absorption with topical use.​[[33]](#c0072n00258)​[[34]](#Murase-91BFD52A) The manufacturer states that there is some evidence that systemic (not topical) fusidic acid crosses the placental barrier,​[[35]](#c0072n00209) but no reports of teratogenicity have been found. Topical ozenoxacin has not been studied in pregnant patients, but systemic absorption is negligible.​[[36]](#CPSOnline.OttawaONCanadianPharmacis-53FB4450)

### Management during Breastfeeding

If a breastfeeding patient requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for a cutaneous infection, penicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin and erythromycin may be used safely, but may alter the bowel flora of the infant and rarely cause a hypersensitivity reaction.​[[32]](#c0072n00198) Small cuts and abrasions on the nipple are common with breastfeeding and may lead to mastitis usually due to S. aureus; continued breastfeeding, warm compresses and careful massage may help to reduce pain and abscess development. Oral or IV antibiotics should be reserved for when conservative measures fail.

Topical mupirocin may be used safely during breastfeeding, since limited amounts are absorbed.​[[37]](#c0072n00259)​[[38]](#c0072n00211) No information on safety of topical use of fusidic acid by a breastfeeding patient is available. The safety of topical ozenoxacin has not been studied in breastfeeding patients; however, it is not expected to be transferred into breast milk, as systemic absorption is negligible.​[[36]](#CPSOnline.OttawaONCanadianPharmacis-53FB4450) As a general precaution, direct skin-to-skin contact of the breastfeeding infant with the patient’s treated skin area should be avoided with topical use of any medication.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- When assessing patients with atopic dermatitis, determine whether secondary infection is present. This may manifest as crusting, weeping, painful fissured eczema, or nonhealing erosions and crusts. Treating the secondary impetiginization is vital for providing symptom relief and control of eczema.
- In patients with recurrent painful, sterile abscesses and scarring in the axillae and groin, consider the possibility of hidradenitis suppurativa and refer for appropriate specialist care (e.g., dermatology or plastic surgery).
- Avoid prolonged use of topical antibacterials (>2 wk) to prevent development of bacterial resistance. Routine topical or systemic antibiotics should be avoided in the management of chronic wounds, such as venous stasis ulcers. Overuse may lead to resistance and possible allergic contact dermatitis.
- In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies, maintain increased vigilance in monitoring for skin and soft tissue infections, which are known complications of these agents.
- Correcting underlying and exacerbating causes of skin infections (e.g., vascular compromise, intertriginous fungal infections) is an important intervention to reduce risk of skin and soft tissue infections.
- After initiation of cellulitis treatment, the affected area can appear to worsen (i.e., deepening of erythema and extension beyond demarcated area) within the next 24–48 hours before clinically improving. This observation is due to the destruction of bacteria, causing release of toxins that produce a localized inflammatory response and should not be misinterpreted as treatment failure.
- Elevation of the affected limb (above the level of the heart) may be used to differentiate between venous stasis and active cellulitis, since the red erythematous appearance will subside if the cause is due to venous stasis but will remain in cellulitis. Limb elevation also assists in reducing the edema.
- When necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, an urgent surgical and/or infectious diseases consultation is warranted.
