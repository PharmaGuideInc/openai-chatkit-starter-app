### Introduction

Treatment of alcohol-related disorders requires a biopsychosocial approach. Alcohol-related disorders are common and have a significant impact on health, productivity and social problems such as domestic violence, impaired driving and crime. This chapter focuses on at-risk drinking as well as 2 components of alcohol-related disorders: alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal (see [Table 1](#n00393) for diagnostic criteria). Other alcohol-related disorders, such as alcohol intoxication, other alcohol-induced disorders and unspecified alcohol-related disorder, will not be discussed.

At-risk drinking is a pattern of drinking that does not meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder, but exceeds recommended safe limits for alcohol consumption. According to Canada’s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines,​[[2]](#ButtPBeirnessDGliksmanLParadisCStoc-08761500) safe limits are:

- Women: 10 drinks per week or 2 drinks per day
- Men: 15 drinks per week or 3 drinks per day

Complications of alcohol use disorder may include:​[[3]](#SpithoffSKahanM.PrimaryCareManageme-0875FF06)

- Poor nutrition (thiamine deficiency, low potassium, low magnesium, low phosphorus)
- Liver disease
- Bleeding diathesis (increased INR, impaired platelet function/thrombocytopenia)
- Tremor, ataxia, seizures, Wernicke encephalopathy
- Autonomic dysfunction (hypertension, dehydration, pyrexia)
- Neuropathy
- Trauma
- Increased risk of certain cancers (mouth, throat, liver, colon, breast)
- Infections (aspiration pneumonia, cellulitis)
- Concurrent psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety)
- Psychosis (hallucinations, delusions)
- Insomnia and sleep apnea

### Goals of Therapy

- Assess and address safety issues, e.g., ability to care for dependents, high-risk activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery
- Change pattern of alcohol use according to patient goals (complete abstinence or reduction)
- Assess for and treat medical complications and/or psychiatric comorbidities
- Assess for and treat alcohol withdrawal
- Facilitate integrated pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment
- Prevent relapse

**Table 1:** Diagnostic Criteria for Select Alcohol-Related Disorders​[[1]](#AmericanPsychiatricAssociation.Diag-0875D7A6)

| Alcohol-Related Disorder | Diagnostic Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol Use Disorder Specify current severity: Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptoms Moderate: Presence of 4−5 symptoms Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms | A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least 2 of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol or recover from its effects. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal) Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms |
| Alcohol Withdrawal | Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged. Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A: Autonomic hyperactivity, e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpm Increased hand tremor Insomnia Nausea or vomiting Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions Psychomotor agitation Anxiety Generalized tonic-clonic seizures The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The signs and symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. |

### Investigations

More information on the assessment of patients with alcohol-related disorders can be found in [Figure 1](#AssessmentAndTreatmentOfPatientsWit-3E809F2F).

- Detailed history and physical examination to assess use (amount, frequency, duration) of alcohol and other substances (opioids, sedative-hypnotics, marijuana, tobacco). Assess impact on function (occupational, social, familial), history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, as well as comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions (see [Table 1](#n00393) for diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal).
- Screening tools are useful for detecting those at risk of alcohol use disorder. All patients should be screened at regular intervals, even if an alcohol problem is not suspected.
  - The one-question screen can be used for a quick assessment:​[[4]](#SmithPC1EtAl.PrimaryCareValidationO-0875F607)
    - One-question screen: How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day? X = 5 for men and 4 for women. An answer of ≥1 is considered positive.
  - If positive, follow-up with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT).​[[5]](#ReinertDFAllenJP.TheAlcoholUseDisor-087616D2)
- Tools such as CIWA-Ar​[[6]](#SullivanJTSykoraKSchneidermanJEtAl.-0875DB3A) (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised) are effective for evaluating the severity of alcohol withdrawal.
- Laboratory tests and/or imaging are used to assess comorbidities/complications. In those with alcohol-related disorders (suspected or confirmed), tests may be routine (pregnancy test, CBC, renal/liver function, electrolytes, magnesium, phosphorus) or as indicated (chest x-ray, CT head, abdominal ultrasound).
- Toxicology, including urine testing for substances (including ethanol and its metabolite, ethylglucuronide). A blood alcohol level is a useful indicator of alcohol use only for a period of hours prior to the test and is not a reliable marker of chronic use.

### Therapeutic Choices

The best practice for the treatment of alcohol use disorder is the integration of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. It is also important to recognize that substance use disorders are relapsing-remitting conditions. Communicate to patients that relapse is a normal part of this disorder and that the practitioner is available to help them if this should occur. For more information on the management of patients with alcohol use disorder, see [Figure 1](#AssessmentAndTreatmentOfPatientsWit-3E809F2F).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- A nonjudgmental approach that views alcohol use disorder as a treatable medical condition and not a moral failing is recommended.
- Consider the stages of change and how ready the patient is for treatment; see [Table 2](#table2). For more information on the Model of Behaviour Change, see Facilitating Behaviour Change. Motivational interviewing is a technique that can be helpful in assisting a patient to move into the action stage of change.​[[7]](#ZimmermanGLOlsenCGBosworthMF.AStage-0875F750)​[[8]](#ProchaskaJODiClementeCCNorcrossJC.I-0875F912)
- In the primary care setting, brief interventions alone (such as the motivational interviewing described in [Table 2](#table2)) have demonstrated efficacy in at-risk drinkers who do not yet meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder.​[[9]](#KanerEFBeyerFDickinsonHOEtAl.Effect-0875FB45) At-risk drinkers may also benefit from brief advice and education regarding Canada’s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines.​[[2]](#ButtPBeirnessDGliksmanLParadisCStoc-08761500)
- Several psychosocial treatment options are available for patients diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder, such as psychoeducation, relapse-prevention training, trauma therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, interpersonal therapy, network support​[[10]](#LittMDKaddenRMKabela-CormierEEtAl.C-0875FD39) (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery), and group and family therapies.​[[11]](#NaranjoCASellersEMChaterKEtAl.Nonph-0875DE9A) There is little evidence to support the superiority of any single modality.​[[12]](#KlimasJTobinHFieldCAEtAl.Psychosoci-087600CA)
- The combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy is associated with a significant increase in abstinence rates.​[[13]](#KhanATanselAWhiteDLEtAl.EfficacyOfP-087602E4) This combination is effective in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety, which is a common presentation in alcohol use disorder.​[[14]](#BakerALThorntonLKHilesSEtAl.Psycohl-0875FA08)

**Table 2:** Stages of Change: Motivational Interviewing Approach

| Stage of Change​[7]​[8] | Motivational Interviewing Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Precontemplation | Encourage patients to openly discuss their alcohol use. Discuss health consequences of heavy alcohol use, but avoid confrontational or judgmental comments or body language. |
| Contemplation | Encourage patients to list pros/cons of alcohol use; create a “decisional balance” weighing out the items on each side. Be understanding if the patient expresses ambivalence, and be encouraging. Provide positive reinforcement of any “change talk.” |
| Preparation | Work on practical elements of planning the quit/reduction attempt. Discuss treatment options including psychosocial treatment, need for withdrawal management and anticraving medications. Address any concerns and provide information on options. |
| Action | Monitor progress. Provide positive reinforcement for any successes. Troubleshoot any difficulties encountered. |
| Maintenance | Continue to provide positive reinforcement of successes. Work on relapse-prevention skills and self-management techniques. Build a community-based support network to sustain motivation to maintain success. |
| Relapse | Normalize relapse as a part of any change process and particularly as part of the disease of addiction. Frame relapse as a learning opportunity and not as a failure. Excessive guilt can lead to shame, which may worsen the relapse. Reassess current stage of change; use motivational approaches to help move patient back into preparation/action phase. |

### Pharmacologic Choices

Medications used in the management of alcohol withdrawal are listed in [Table 3](#dt1); those used for alcohol use disorder are listed in [Table 4](#dt2).

General principles:

- Assess need for pharmacologic treatment of withdrawal symptoms
- Initiate pharmacotherapy to assist with alcohol reduction or cessation
- Medication is most effective when used in combination with psychosocial treatment

### Thiamine Deficiency

Heavy alcohol consumption can lead to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency through poor dietary intake and interference with vitamin absorption. Thiamine deficiency puts patients at risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, which can be fatal. Thiamine replacement is recommended for all patients who consume significant amounts of alcohol. Given the poor quality of studies of this treatment, expert consensus recommends a dose of 200 mg per day.​[[17]](#DayEBenthamPWCallaghanREtAl.Thiamin-C0C7142A)

### Alcohol Withdrawal

Approximately two-thirds of patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be managed with supportive measures and monitoring.​[[18]](#HackJBHoffmanRSNelsonLS.ResistantAl-0875E1FE) Pharmacologic treatment is always required for moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal and may be required for about one-third of patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Most cases respond well to benzodiazepines, as they reduce the hyperactivity of GABA that occurs during withdrawal. A benzodiazepine protocol, with dosing based on the patient’s CIWA-Ar score, can be used in the primary care setting to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.​[[19]](#SAMHADocument-08760478) For more information on how to prepare the patient for office-based withdrawal, see the [Primary Care Addiction Toolkit](https://www.porticonetwork.ca/web/alcohol-toolkit/treatment/alcohol-withdrawal). Patients should be counselled on the risk of respiratory depression if alcohol relapse occurs during (or shortly after) benzodiazepine treatment, due to its synergistic effect. For dosing information, see [Table 3](#dt1).

Larger doses of benzodiazepines and/or addition of a different GABA-inhibitory drug such as phenobarbital may be required for resistant alcohol withdrawal (<5% of cases); such patients will require monitoring in a critical care area.​[[15]](#GoldJARimalBNolanAEtAl.AStrategyOfE-0875E30F)​[[16]](#MinozziSAmatoLVecchiSEtAl.Anticonvu-0875E508)

### Alcohol Use Disorder

Evidence supports the use of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorders.​[[19]](#SAMHADocument-08760478)​[[20]](#JonasDEAmickHRFeltnerCEtAl.Pharmaco-087605E5)

First-line options include:​[[21]](#ReusVIFochtmannLJBuksteinOEtAl.TheA-9B838B05)

- Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, thought to decrease the euphoria related to endogenous opioid release upon drinking alcohol, thus making drinking less pleasurable. It is therefore useful in patients who wish to abstain from drinking or reduce consumption without completely abstaining. Naltrexone also reduces cravings for alcohol. In a meta-analysis, naltrexone demonstrated greater efficacy in decreasing heavy drinking and cravings than acamprosate.​[[22]](#MaiselNCBlodgettJCWilbournePLEtAl.M-087607A2) Administered in a primary care setting, naltrexone has been shown to be as effective as specialist-administered cognitive behavioural therapy.​[[23]](#AntonRFOMalleySSCirauloDAEtAl.Combi-0875EAB1) Naltrexone is contraindicated in patients on opioid therapy due to precipitation of opioid withdrawal; a patient must be opioid-free for ≥7 days prior to naltrexone initiation. Use with caution in those with hepatic dysfunction due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.
- Acamprosate is a glutamate and GABA modulator, which is believed to underlie its ability to relieve symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the euphoric effects of alcohol. Acamprosate has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining abstinence from alcohol when combined with psychosocial programs.​[[24]](#RosnerSHackl-HerrwerthALeuchtSEtAl.-08760D9B) It is the treatment of choice for patients with hepatic insufficiency, since it is renally excreted. Acamprosate also may be the drug of choice in patients whose aim is complete abstinence from alcohol. In a meta-analysis, acamprosate demonstrated greater efficacy in maintaining complete alcohol abstinence than naltrexone.​[[22]](#MaiselNCBlodgettJCWilbournePLEtAl.M-087607A2)

Preliminary studies have investigated the concurrent use of naltrexone and acamprosate, but further research is required.​[[24]](#RosnerSHackl-HerrwerthALeuchtSEtAl.-08760D9B)

Second-line options should be considered after trials of both naltrexone and acamprosate:​[[21]](#ReusVIFochtmannLJBuksteinOEtAl.TheA-9B838B05)

- Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of alcohol. If a patient on disulfiram therapy drinks alcohol, acetaldehyde levels increase, causing the “disulfiram reaction” (nausea, flushing, vertigo, arrhythmias and, rarely, death). Disulfiram is an aversive therapy, meaning that patients stop drinking out of fear of experiencing this very unpleasant reaction. Low-quality studies have shown that supervised disulfiram may be beneficial in patients with a particularly long history of alcohol use disorder.​[[25]](#DiehlAUlmerLMutschlerJEtAl.WhyIsDis-08760C0D) It is contraindicated in those with hepatic dysfunction due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Disulfiram is not as extensively studied as other therapies, nor is it commercially available in Canada. It may be accessible at select compounding pharmacies.
- Anticonvulsant medications (e.g., topiramate, gabapentin) have been investigated for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.​[[26]](#PaniPPTroguEPaciniMEtAl.Anticonvuls-08761162) The proposed mechanism of action is similar to that of acamprosate, i.e., modulation of glutamate receptors and attenuation of withdrawal and cravings. Efficacy of these agents is equivocal, and adverse effects may include cognitive dysfunction.​[[26]](#PaniPPTroguEPaciniMEtAl.Anticonvuls-08761162) Anticonvulsant medications require slow titration into the therapeutic range to mitigate side effects. A study investigating gabapentin for alcohol use disorder demonstrated a higher abstinence rate than placebo (17% vs. 4%), although the dropout rate was high.​[[27]](#MasonBJQuelloSGoodellVEtAl.Gabapent-087612D1)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), alcohol-related birth defects and spontaneous abortion.

Alcohol withdrawal carries a risk to both mother and baby, and should take place in a medically supervised in-patient setting. The CIWA-Ar scale is utilized, and benzodiazepine loading protocols are similar to those used for the nonpregnant population.

There are no studies investigating the pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.​[[28]](#SmithEJLuiSTerplanM.PharmacologicIn-08760F92) The safety of acamprosate, disulfiram and naltrexone in pregnancy has not been established and thus prescribers must carefully weigh the risks of using such medications against the risk of continued alcohol use.​[[19]](#SAMHADocument-08760478)

With respect to breastfeeding, disulfiram is contraindicated.​[[19]](#SAMHADocument-08760478) Although naltrexone appears to be minimally transferred into breast milk,​[[29]](#DrugsAndLactationDatabaseLactMed.Be-C87F4CB2) limited data exist regarding the safety of both acamprosate or naltrexone in the breastfeeding mother and thus prescribers must assess the benefits versus the risks of treatment.​[[19]](#SAMHADocument-08760478)​[[30]](#Briggs-0876087E)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Choices for Older Persons

Older patients are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to a variety of factors including lower levels of the enzymes that metabolize alcohol, lower total body water and concurrent medical conditions. Elderly patients tend to have more severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may experience medical complications of alcohol use more frequently than younger patients. In withdrawal management, avoid diazepam, which is renally excreted and may result in accumulation of both diazepam and its active metabolites. Lorazepam is the preferred choice for withdrawal management in this population. Elderly patients may benefit from relapse-prevention medications; carefully consider the increased potential for adverse reactions and drug interactions in this population.

### Therapeutic Tips

- For screening, assessment and treatment tools and resources, see the [Primary Care Addiction Toolkit: Dealing with Alcohol Problems](https://www.porticonetwork.ca/web/alcohol-toolkit/).
- Studies have shown that the primary care setting is ideal for treating alcohol-related disorders due to increased accessibility, continuity of care, and the pre-established relationship between the family physician and patient.​[[3]](#SpithoffSKahanM.PrimaryCareManageme-0875FF06)​[[9]](#KanerEFBeyerFDickinsonHOEtAl.Effect-0875FB45)​[[23]](#AntonRFOMalleySSCirauloDAEtAl.Combi-0875EAB1)
- A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy is the treatment of choice for alcohol use disorders.
- The treatment of concurrent mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, should be integrated into the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and treatment for both conditions should occur simultaneously.
