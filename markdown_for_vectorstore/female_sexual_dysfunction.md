CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “women” or “female” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Sexual dysfunction impacts the quality of life of people of all genders. This chapter addresses 3 disorders of sexual function: female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD) and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.

Sexual response results from the brain's appraisal of sexual stimuli to trigger feelings of sexual excitement, arousal and desire as well as physical responses including genital blood flow and congestion (see [Figure 1](#c0077n00006)).​[[4]](#c0077n00097)​[[5]](#c0077n00098) Although the major factors influencing sexual response are mood, stress,​[[6]](#c0077n00130) feelings for sexual partners and past sexual experiences,​[[7]](#c0077n00100)​[[8]](#c0077n00084) other aspects of health, such as medical conditions, obesity,​[[9]](#c0077n00131) medications, surgery, radiation or aging, may contribute to impairment.​[[10]](#c0077n00150)​[[11]](#c0077n00103)​[[12]](#c0077n00085)​[[13]](#c0077n00086)

Multiple factors influence a patient’s motivation to begin a sexual encounter,​[[7]](#c0077n00100)​[[14]](#c0077n00101) their response to stimulation and level of arousal. Frequently the degree of subjective arousal and genital congestion are poorly correlated.​[[15]](#c0077n00102) A lack of subjective arousal commonly occurs despite a genital vasocongestive response.​[[15]](#c0077n00102) A patient’s awareness of the engorgement of the genitalia is often minimal. The subjective experience is influenced more consistently by concurrent thoughts and emotions than by feedback from the vasocongesting genitalia.​[[16]](#c0077n00036) In assessing a patient’s sexual concerns, it is recommended to interview both the patient and any partner who is interested in particpating, preferably together and separately (see [Table 1](#c0077n00151)).​[[17]](#c0077n00104)

### FSIAD & FOD

### Introduction

To make a diagnosis of FSIAD, there must be a lack of sexual interest/arousal for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months as manifested by at least 3 of the following indicators:​[[18]](#c0077n00132)

- Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity
- Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies
- No/reduced initiation of sexual activity and typically unreceptive to attempts by others to initiate
- Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity in all or almost all (approximately 75%) sexual encounters
- Absent/reduced sexual interest/arousal in response to any internal or external sexual/erotic cues, e.g., written, verbal, visual
- Absent/reduced genital and/or nongenital sensations during sexual activity in all or almost all (approximately 75%) sexual encounters

Note that the diagnosis of female hypoactive desire disorder and female arousal disorder have been merged into FSIAD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-5) to increase diagnostic precision. FSIAD includes potential loss of genital sexual sensitivity seen typically at menopause.

To make a diagnosis of FOD, at least 1 of the 2 following symptoms must have been present for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months and be experienced on all or almost all (approximately 75%) occasions of sexual activity:​[[18]](#c0077n00132)

- Marked delay in, infrequency of, or absence of orgasm
- Markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensation

### Goals of Therapy

- Improve patient’s knowledge and understanding of sexual response cycle (see [Figure 1](#c0077n00006)). Address problematic areas as identified by the patient, which are often lack of desired sexual stimuli or context, and frequently inability to stay focused on the sensations of sexual arousal due to sexual and non-sexual distracting thoughts including the fear of a negative outcome.
- Identify need for psychological or psychiatric consultation for deep-seated issues that result in a patient experiencing negative emotions such as shame, guilt or disgust with arousal or for issues regarding control and vulnerability precluding orgasmic release.

### Investigations

- Sexual history including current and past sexual function of both patient and partner(s), if appropriate (see [Table 1](#c0077n00151)). Past sexual function strongly modulates current sexual function​[[7]](#c0077n00100)
- Medical history including current and past depression—the factor most consistently correlated with sexual function of both well and chronically ill patients​[[7]](#c0077n00100)​[[19]](#c0077n00105)​[[20]](#refitem-1192121-0B6496C5)
- Address factors impairing subjective arousal: psychological (e.g., distractions, depression, sexual anxiety, stressors, relationship issues, previous abuse) and biological (e.g., fatigue, chronic pain)
- For patients in partnered relationship, past and present concerns focusing on nonsexual intimacy, trust and respect, safety, birth control, fertility, and stressors
- Address medications that may impair subjective arousal or interfere with genital vasocongestion (see [Table 2](#drugsfsd))
- Address any lack of required auditory, visual or physical sexual stimuli
- Genital examination: physical examination is required when FSIAD is in the context of medical disease potentially limiting genital vasocongestion such as multiple sclerosis, pelvic cancer surgery/radiation, scleroderma or when there is a reported lack of genital sexual sensitivity that may result from conditions such as lichen sclerosus or the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).​[[21]](#c0077n00112) GSM refers to genital symptoms (dryness, burning, irritation), sexual symptoms (dyspareunia) and urinary symptoms (urgency, dysuria, urinary tract infections) seen in postmenopausal patients.
- Lab investigations only as indicated by medical history. No correlation has been found between androgen levels and sexual function, even when using mass spectrometry methods, which avoid the difficulties with previous assays of testosterone.​[[22]](#c0077n00106) In the past, lack of correlation was thought to be in part because about 50% of testosterone is made within cells and not reflected in serum levels. However, in studies of patients with and without distressing low sexual desire, no correlation was found between sexual desire and total testosterone as measured by serum androgen metabolites.​[[20]](#refitem-1192121-0B6496C5)​[[22]](#c0077n00106)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Standard therapy includes cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sexual therapy and, more recently, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).​[[26]](#c0077n00114)​[[27]](#c0077n00135)

- Screen for and treat mood disorders, especially depression, with CBT or MBCT.
- Counsel or refer the patient when emotional intimacy is insufficient to motivate the patient sexually and/or impairs subjective arousal/pleasure.
- Address lack of stimuli, e.g., insufficient nongenital stimuli, insufficient nonpenetrative genital stimuli or lack of desired sexual context. A range of stimuli are often needed, including nonphysical (e.g., erotic conversation or music), nongenital (e.g., caressing/kissing neck, breasts, thighs, toes) and genital but nonpenetrative (e.g., manual, oral or vibrator stimulation of mons pubis and all parts of the vulva).
- Address psychological factors that are inhibiting the effectiveness of sexual stimulation:

  - distractions/nonsexual stressors
  - dysphoric arousal (may indicate previous abuse)
  - constant sexual self-monitoring
  - low self-esteem/poor body image/feeling sexually substandard
  - past experience of pain—a past history of dyspareunia can interfere with the processing of sexual stimuli, even if pain is currently absent
  - negative outcome, e.g., sexual dysfunction of partner(s), dyspareunia from provoked vestibulodynia (see [Genito-pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder](#c0077n00019)) and subsequent sexual avoidance. In this situation, address the primary problem
  - negative emotions with arousal
  - suppressed anger and therefore suppressed sexual emotions
  - learned pattern of feeling emotions minimally
- Address biological factors limiting the effectiveness of stimulation (other than depression):

  - conditions that may be impairing genital vasocongestion, (e.g., estrogen deficiency)
  - medications (see [Table 2](#drugsfsd))
  - fatigue, e.g., chronic ill health, sleep disorder, shift work, disturbed nights, chronic pain
  - irregular or absent menstrual cycles indicative of hyperprolactinemia
  - hypo and hyperthyroidism
  - urinary incontinence and fear of incontinence during sexual activity

Specific for FOD:

- Guided self-stimulation involves education and information followed by body awareness exercises designed to enhance the patient’s awareness of their genitals and to challenge any negative or distorted thoughts that might emerge. Explain that vulnerability is needed to let go of control so that orgasm occurs. This is very difficult for many people; learning to orgasm alone may be the first step (see [Suggested Readings](#SR-FSD)).
- Coital Alignment Technique is a behavioural technique that allows more pubis-to-pubis contact between partners during intercourse so as to stimulate the deep clitoral bulbar tissue deep in the perineal muscles.
- Vibrostimulation involves the use of a vibrator. It may be especially useful in patients with nerve damage (e.g., from multiple sclerosis or diabetes).
- Referral to mental health professional if the following issues are identified: lack of trust, fear of closeness or fear of losing control.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Note that there is a significant psychosocial aspect to sexual difficulties experienced some patients, and current systemic treatment options have been found to be minimally superior to placebo.​[[28]](#refitem-1182129-0BDF3AD8)

### Topical

Use **local** estrogen when lack of genital congestion, loss of pleasure from genital stimulation, loss of lubrication or dyspareunia are associated with estrogen-deficient states (see Menopause).

**Vaginal** lubricants (e.g., Astroglide) or **moisturizers** (e.g., Replens, Gynatrof, Zestica) used regularly improve lubrication but may not remove pain from lost elasticity.

Vaginal **dehydroepiandrosterone (**DHEA**)** provides a sexual benefit in terms of motivation and desire seemingly from increases in coital comfort, genital sexual sensitivity and ease of orgasm without any increase in serum levels of testosterone or estrogen.​[[29]](#c0077n00115) Vaginal DHEA, prasterone (Intrarosa) was approved by Health Canada in 2019 for the treatment of GSM. It is also used off label for menopausal loss of genital sexual sensitivity. DHEA can also be compounded into a cream or vaginal suppository.

### Systemic

In North America, testosterone supplementation is not approved or recommended for women. While testosterone has been prescribed off-label for complaints of low desire in those who are postmenopausal, there is ample evidence that low desire in these patients is not related to testosterone levels.​[[22]](#c0077n00106) RCTs showed conflicting results with testosterone.​[[30]](#c0077n00146)​[[31]](#c0077n00143)​[[32]](#c0077n00144)​[[33]](#c0077n00145) The trials were underpowered and lacked appropriate inclusion criteria and long-term safety data. Although the last American Endocrine Society guidelines recommended short-term treatment with investigational testosterone limited to accurately diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, that diagnosis is no longer clinically relevant with the 2013 DSM-5 criteria.​[[34]](#c0077n00088) ​[[35]](#Davis2019)Importantly, the lack of safety data beyond 2 years also precludes recommendation of investigational testosterone for female sexual dysfunction.​[[34]](#c0077n00088)

Flibanserin is a serotonin agonist/antagonist and weak partial dopamine agonist with approval by Health Canada in 2018 for low sexual desire in premenopausal patients. Its use leads to a mean increase of 0.49 satisfying sexual events per month and an increase of 0.3–0.4 on the desire subscale of a validated questionnaire (mean baseline is 1.8–1.9 on a scale of 1.2–6.0).​[[36]](#refitem-1182133-0CE49A5D) Major drug interactions are a concern; alcohol and moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) cause hypotension with a risk of syncope and must be strictly avoided.​[[36]](#refitem-1182133-0CE49A5D) The minimal benefit and daily dosing requirement along with drug interaction concerns limits the drug’s use.

Sildenafil in clinical practice and randomized controlled trials has not been found to benefit patients with impaired physical arousal (e.g., sexual dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury). With the exception of one small RCT investigating the use of sildenafil (50–100 mg as needed prior to sexual activity) in antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction,​[[37]](#c0077n00139) sildenafil has not been found clinically useful.

The treatment and remission of depression improves sexual desire and function beyond any sexual dysfunction that may emerge as a side effect from medication. Preferably choose sexually neutral drugs, e.g., bupropion, vortioxetine or vilazodone​[[23]](#c0077n00107)​[[38]](#refitem-1182129-0BDD2FB3)​[[39]](#refitem-1182129-0BDCB8F0) (see [Table 2](#drugsfsd)).

### Genito-pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

### Introduction

To make this diagnosis, persistent or recurrent difficulties for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months with 1 or more of the following must be present:​[[18]](#c0077n00132)

- Marked difficulty with vaginal penetration
- Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal penetration attempts
- Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration
- Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration

*Dyspareunia* is persistent or recurrent pain with attempted or complete vaginal entry and/or penetrative vaginal intercourse.​[[25]](#c0077n00058) *Vaginismus* is the persistent or recurrent difficulty of a patient to allow vaginal entry of a finger, a penis and/or any object, despite the patient’s expressed wish to do so. There is often phobic avoidance and anticipation/fear/experience of pain, along with variable and involuntary pelvic muscle contraction. Vaginismus and dyspareunia are now merged under genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder due to clinical overlap.

Because some patients are unable to endure penetration, penile introital contact may have rarely or never been possible in those who desire it. A history of unconsummated heterosexual relationships with or without allodynia of the vestibule observed during physical examination can confirm a diagnosis of vaginismus.

*Provoked vestibulodynia* (PVD) is the most common cause of dyspareunia affecting about 16% of patients.​[[40]](#c0077n00116)​[[41]](#c0077n00117) The pain is typically from touch to the vaginal opening (including attempted vaginal penetration) associated with allodynia (pain sensation from a non-painful stimulus) around the outer edge of the hymen and no abnormal physical signs other than variable redness. Other chronic pain syndromes are typically present including severe dysmenorrhea in adolescence.​[[42]](#c0077n00118)

*Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)*: the dyspareunia associated with the pallor, loss of elasticity, skin turgor and atrophy of labia minora can lead to symptoms similar to those of PVD: painful introitus, pain with penetration and movement, and post-coital burning. Note that the 2 conditions may coexist.​[[43]](#refitem-1172144-0D63242A)

### Goals of Therapy

- Increased understanding of chronic pain (i.e., a composite experience of physical sensations, emotions and thoughts) and how parts of the pain experience can be altered using methods such as CBT/MBCT
- Recognition and management of any contributing biological factors, personal psychological factors or psychosexual factors

### Investigations

- Gynecologic, medical and psychosocial history to identify any contributing factors (see [Table 3](#c077n00152))
- Physical exam looking for:

  - abdominal tenderness, masses
  - signs of GSM
  - interlabial fissures (associated with estrogen deficiency or candidiasis)
  - signs of past tears of posterior fourchette
  - adhesions between labia minora, which preclude penetration and require surgical division
  - tight posterior fourchette requiring topical estrogen or simple perineoplasty
  - abnormal discharge (vaginal infection or possibly more serious pelvic pathology)
  - erythema of introital margin (consistent with but not diagnostic of PVD)
  - allodynia of introital margin (diagnostic of PVD)
  - lichen sclerosus involving the introitus

- Bimanual exam: pain on palpation of uterus, cervix or adnexae, or nodularity along uterosacral ligaments or in the pouch of Douglas are all evidence of possible pelvic pathology; pelvic muscle hypertonicity with “trigger points” in deep levator ani muscles; abnormalities in urethra, bladder or rectum
- Patients unable to be examined: encourage preparing for the exam at home for 10 minutes daily. Patient should recline on couch or bed, or in the bathtub, partially abducting the thighs and touching the vulva and ultimately the introitus, spreading the labia so the introitus can be examined. When the patient is ready for the exam, allow them to be in control, separating the labia, with any touch (e.g., with a Q-tip for PVD) done by the patient themselves. Full examination is preferably delayed to a subsequent visit

**Table 3:** Contributing Factors to Genito-pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

| Biological Factors | Psychological Factors | Psychosexual Factors |
| Sensitization of the central nervous system associated with anxiety disorders and other types of stress (PVD) Estrogen deficiency Infection, e.g., chronic vaginitis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic pathology, e.g., endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, inflammatory bowel disease Rare congenital abnormalities, e.g., vaginal septum Other chronic pain syndromes in patients with PVD | Fear of pain or being damaged by something entering the vagina, difficulty with relinquishing control causing reflexive pelvic muscle tightening on introital contact (vaginismus) Ambivalence about being sexual (the pain may be solely from appropriate tightening of perivaginal muscles) Psychological distress associated with intense fear of negative evaluation, anxiety, somatization and catastrophization as shown by a majority of patients with PVD Past and present stress (PVD) | Lowered sexual self-confidence Avoiding sexual stimuli or finding stimuli ineffective because of the focus on negative outcome Feelings of being extremely sexually abnormal, shame and guilt Lack of sexual arousal and therefore lack of increased elasticity, lubrication and expansion of proximal vagina For those in partnered relationships, partner(s) may be confused, feel unattractive and withdraw emotionally, compounding the patient’s low sexual self-image |

- Determine timing of pain. See [Table 4](#TimingPainCondition).

  **Table 4:** Timing of Pain and Commonly Associated Condition

  

| Timing of Pain/Condition | GSM | Infection | Lack of Arousal | Pelvic Pathology (e.g., endometriosis) | PVD | Tears of Posterior Fourchette | Vaginismus |
| External contact (i.e., minimal entry of finger, penis or other object) |  |  |  |  | + |  | + |
| Partial entry | + |  |  |  | + | + | + |
| Full entry and movement |  |  | + | + | + |  |  |
| Movement, if applicable | + | + |  |  | + |  |  |
| Ejaculation, if applicable, and/or postcoital urination | + |  |  |  | + | + |  |
| Any of the above, lasts hours after sexual encounter |  |  |  | + | + |  |  |

- Laboratory investigations as indicated by history and physical examination

  - KOH whiff test (fishy odour intensified by addition of a few drops of potassium hydroxide 10% to vaginal secretions on speculum or smear) to detect bacterial vaginosis
  - microscopy and pH for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, trichomoniasis
  - fasting glucose and HIV status if chronic candidiasis present
  - biopsy of any vulval area with abnormal appearance
  - DNA and/or culture for gonococcus and chlamydia

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Identify nonpharmacologic means of addressing pain, e.g., MBCT,​[[44]](#c0077n00119) CBT​[[45]](#c0077n00136)
- Assess pelvic muscle hypertonicity​[[46]](#refitem-1172146-0D6462C9) and identify physical methods (including pelvic muscle physiotherapy and biofeedback) to address the associated hypertonicity of pelvic muscles

  - refer to pelvic muscle physiotherapist or teach “reverse Kegel exercises” with use of conical vaginal inserts of gradually increasing diameter
- Explain role of stress in chronic pain, and counsel on management
- Advise patients to focus on sexual activity that does not include vaginal penetration of any kind in order to break the cycle of pain
- Address concomitant lack of arousal and desire that is different than what is normal for the patient
- Refer for definitive treatment if pelvic pathology suspected
- Refer if conservative therapy for recurrent tearing of posterior fourchette fails (see [Other](#Other))

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause

Intravaginal estrogen is beneficial for GSM (see Menopause) using tablet, cream or Silastic ring formulation to restore vaginal cell health, pH and to increase vulvar and vaginal blood flow. When systemic estrogen is used for nonsexual reasons, additional topical vaginal estrogen may still be required. Vaginal DHEA improves dyspareunia associated with GSM along with other aspects of sexual function without an increase in serum levels of testosterone and estrogen. **Vaginal** hyaluronic acid **hydrogel** provides similar benefit to 0.5 mg estriol cream when applied every 3 days with benefits being seen in 2 weeks.​[[47]](#refitem-1182146-0BE90C7A) Other **vaginal** lubricants and **vaginal moisturizers** can be helpful when used regularly to improve lubrication (see Menopause).

Intravaginal estrogen therapy may be required for GSM associated with chemotherapy-induced menopause. Sudden iatrogenic loss of ovarian estrogen is frequently highly symptomatic. For patients with estrogen-dependent cancer, an individual approach is necessary. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that while nonhormonal treatments are preferred, current low-dose estrogen vaginal products do not raise serum estrogen levels above those in untreated menopausal patients and are not associated with higher breast cancer recurrence rates or endometrial stimulation.​[[48]](#refitem-1172149-318B6732) More research is required before recommendations can be made regarding the use of vaginal estrogens in patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (where the goal of adjuvant therapy is a complete absence of estrogen at the tissue level).​[[48]](#refitem-1172149-318B6732)

### Provoked Vestibulodynia

Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of PVD are lacking. The application of a local anti-inflammatory (i.e., sodium cromoglycate) to prevent the release of inflammatory agents from mast cells or the introital application of a local anesthetic (i.e., lidocaine) is of benefit to some patients.​[[50]](#refitem-1182146-0CF24526)​[[51]](#c0077n00121) The local anesthetic may be used in conjunction with psychological therapy: a patient may regain sexual confidence with different types of sex and experience reduced distress and pain intensity as therapy progresses. Topical local anesthetic can be applied to residual allodynia prior to a sexual encounter. The lessened reactivity to physical sensations and the expectation of less pain and elevated reward contribute to reduced intensity of dyspareunia. PVD at menopause may benefit from local estrogen applied directly to the introitus. There is consensus to recommend against the use of topical steroids and botulinum toxins.​[[51]](#c0077n00121)​[[52]](#c0077n00122) Although some patients may benefit from either tricyclic antidepressants (with or without additional local anesthetic) or antiseizure drugs, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in the treatment of PVD.

### Other

For recurrent posterior fourchette tearing, intravaginal estrogen **cream** can be applied topically to the affected area. Topical testosterone 2% (compounded in a vehicle such as Glaxal Base) is also helpful. Apply sparingly daily to the posterior fourchette and review in 3 months.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Information is often therapeutic, especially for changes in sexual function and needs in all patients with life cycle changes and aging. For those in partnered relationships, note that desire commonly lessens with duration of relationships; sexual pleasure and satisfaction may increase if emotional intimacy is strong. Gradual loss of spontaneous/initial desire, but the ability to become aroused and trigger desire “once into it” is normal for many patients, especially those who are middle-aged and older. The need for orgasm with each sexual interaction normally lessens with age in most.
- Loss of sexual desire is a common symptom of depression. Successful treatment of the depression is the most important aspect of improving sexual desire and function,​[[23]](#c0077n00107) despite the fact that many antidepressants can cause not only orgasmic dysfunction but loss of desire. Vortioxetine, bupropion, mirtazapine and moclobemide appear to be less likely to cause sexual dysfunction.​[[38]](#refitem-1182129-0BDD2FB3)​[[53]](#c0077n00147)​[[54]](#refitem-1192126-0B66FE8D) There is some evidence that adding on bupropion 150 mg twice daily may benefit patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.​[[53]](#c0077n00147)
- For patients complaining of low sexual desire or arousal or orgasmic dysfunction, construct the sex response cycle (see [Figure 1](#c0077n00006)) to identify the breaks. Application of this logic is therapeutic, as the patient may feel less dysfunctional and become aware of the contextual and interpersonal changes needed to restore motivation and the ability to become sexually aroused and satisfied.
- Most patients complaining of lack of arousal have normal vulvar and vaginal congestion. Focus assessment and therapy on the adequacy of stimuli and context and the biological and psychological factors interfering with arousability.
- When the etiology of desire and arousal disorders appears to stem from deep-seated themes in childhood or adolescence and/or there is a history of abuse (mental, emotional, physical), refer to a psychiatrist or psychologist. When the relevant factors are lack of useful sexual contexts, stimuli, sexual information, needed eroticism and attractive behaviours of others, consider referral to a sex therapist.
