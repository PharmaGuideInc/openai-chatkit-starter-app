### Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infection of the cardiac endothelium associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs as a result of a combination of injury or trauma to the cardiac endothelial surface (e.g., turbulent blood flow, congenital cardiac abnormalities, IV catheter or foreign particulate matter), fibrin deposition and bacterial adherence. Infective endocarditis may involve the heart valves and surrounding tissues on either the left or right side of the heart, although bilateral involvement has been described. Metastatic infection to extracardiac sites may occur. Complications include heart failure, periannular abscess, mycotic aneurysm and glomerulonephritis. Emboli to extracardiac sites such as the brain, lung or kidney may also occur.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce morbidity and mortality associated with IE
- Eradicate infection
- Stabilize or normalize patient hemodynamics via pharmacologic, surgical and supportive interventions as necessary
- Avoid or minimize drug toxicity
- Prevent IE in patients with cardiovascular conditions at risk of severe outcome

### Investigations

The modified Duke criteria (last updated in 2000) are widely accepted as the clinical standard for determining the likelihood of IE.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[2]](#c0124n1002) The criteria are used to classify IE cases as definite, probable or rejected based on pathologic, clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings (see [Table 1](#c0124n00021) and [Table 2](#c0124n00022)).​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[2]](#c0124n1002) Due to the heterogeneous nature of IE, clinical judgment should be used in conjunction with the modified Duke criteria.​[[2]](#c0124n1002)

- Systematic history and physical examination:

  - History: conduct a thorough history to document signs and symptoms, time course of illness and potential risk factors, e.g., recent dental or surgical procedures, poor dental health, cardiac disease or malformation, history of cardiac surgery or valve replacement, prior history of IE, IV drug use, or placement or manipulation of any intravascular device; review past/recent microbiology results and past animal exposure(s)
  - Medication history: conduct a thorough medication review. Assess patients receiving oral anticoagulation to determine anticoagulation need (e.g., temporarily stopping anticoagulants) if IE is suspected or documented. Note whether patient is taking any antibiotics that may interfere with culture results. Document drug allergies including antibiotics
  - Symptoms: fever, chills, weakness, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, arthralgia, night sweats, skin lesions, nausea/vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, back pain
  - Physical findings:

    - Metastatic infection: spinal tenderness, neurologic defects, loss of visual acuity
    - Signs of cardiac infection/decompensation: cardiac murmurs, pulmonary edema to suggest heart failure, hypotension
    - Extra-cardiac manifestations of endocarditis: splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, buccal or mucosal surface petechiae, clubbing, Roth spots, conjunctival petechiae, splenomegaly
- Laboratory investigations:

  - Blood cultures prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy are key to determining the pathogen, antibiotic sensitivities and antibiotic management. Take at least 3 blood culture sets from different venipuncture sites, with the first and last samples at least 1 hour apart.​[[1]](#c0124n1001) Alternatively, at least 3 blood culture sets taken within a 1–2 hour interval has also been recommended.​[[3]](#BaltimoreRSGewitzMBaddourLMBeermanL-4FFCFA1B) Ensure sufficient blood volume (minimum 30–40 mL plus per bottle in an adult patient) to improve detection. Repeat blood cultures after 24–72 hours during antibiotic therapy to confirm clearance of bacteremia​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[4]](#habib)
  - CBC and differential, electrolytes, glucose, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein, complement C3/C4
  - Urinalysis to detect abnormalities such as hematuria, proteinuria, pyuria or red cell casts
  - Negative blood cultures may require serologic and/or molecular diagnostics to identify difficult-to-grow pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii and Bartonella spp. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist and/or clinical microbiologist is encouraged
- Diagnostic tests:

  - Baseline ECG and chest radiograph
  - Echocardiography in all patients with suspected or documented IE. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is commonly available and performed initially, especially in patients with low suspicion or risk of IE.​[[1]](#c0124n1001) Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than TTE for detecting abscess, small vegetations, or small extension into tissue surrounding the valve or for assessing prosthetic heart valves.​[[1]](#c0124n1001) TEE may be used in high-risk patients (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia) or those with moderate to high suspicion of IE. Repeat or follow-up echocardiography may be used to assess response to antimicrobial therapy, disease progression, new intracardiac complications (e.g., unexplained progression of heart failure symptoms, change in cardiac murmurs, new atrioventricular block or arrhythmia), or need for surgery
- Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist and/or cardiothoracic surgeon
- Consider referring to local/institutional beta-lactam hypersensitivity guidelines or consulting with an immunologist for patients with beta-lactam hypersensitivity reactions

In 2023, the International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) proposed modifications to the 2000 modified Duke criteria.​[[5]](#newDuke) Highlights of the proposed Duke-ISCVID changes include clarification of IE definitions and changes to the major and minor criteria (including additional of pathogens, blood sampling, radiologic and microbiologic tests, IE history and presence of cardiac devices).​[[5]](#newDuke) The goal of these changes per the authorship group was to stimulate and encourage further research.​[[5]](#newDuke) The proposed changes were based on expert opinion of published studies over the last 2 decades.​[[6]](#updateDuke) Post publication, several retrospective studies assessed the ISCVID criteria, finding increased sensitivity but decreased specificity compared to previous versions of the Duke criteria.​[[7]](#Goehringer)​[[8]](#Moisset)​[[9]](#Papadimetriou)​[[10]](#van_der_Vaart)​[[11]](#Chambers) Other studies have suggested the ISCVID criteria could be improved with revisions.​[[12]](#Lindberg23)​[[13]](#Lindberg24) Further studies may be warranted to elucidate possible refinements to the criteria before full adoption.​[[13]](#Lindberg24)

### Treatment of Infective Endocarditis

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Surgical Intervention

Surgery is indicated for patients with life-threatening heart failure secondary to valvular damage (regurgitation or stenosis) due to IE.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[14]](#c0124n1005) Other indications for surgical intervention include persistent emboli, embolic complication, large vegetation (>10 mm), failure of adequate antimicrobial treatment to control infection, severe valvular failure (abscess, dehiscence, perforation or rupture) or evidence of extension into surrounding cardiac tissues or relapsing infection.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[14]](#c0124n1005) The timing for the surgery should be chosen in consultation with the cardiothoracic surgeon. Early transfer to a cardiovascular surgery centre should be considered if not an option at the current hospital.

### Pharmacologic Choices

IV antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis is described in [Table 9](#c0124n00045).

### Pathogens and Considerations for Treatment

The Gram-positive bacteria staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci account for the majority of pathogens causing IE.​[[15]](#c0124n1006) Other bacterial pathogens include Gram-negative bacteria. Selection of an antibiotic regimen is based on patient risk factors and adherence, left- versus right-sided IE, native versus prosthetic valve, cultures and antibiotic sensitivities, and likelihood of antibiotic resistance. Prosthetic valve involvement or disseminated infection requires combination regimens with an extended duration of treatment.

### Staphylococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for staphylococcal endocarditis can be found in [Table 3](#c0124n00028). Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains, or coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis) may occur in both native and prosthetic valve IE and together account for approximately 40% of cases of IE.

**Table 3:** Treatment of Staphylococcal Native or Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis​[[1]](#c0124n1001)

| IE Type | Suggested Regimen(s) | Duration​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Staphylococci—Native (No Prosthetic Material) |
| MSSA | Cloxacillin or cefazolin | 6 wk | May use 2‑wk treatment if the infective endocarditis is right-sided and uncomplicated (no renal impairment, no extracardiac metastatic infection).​ [1] In patients with a beta-lactam type-1 hypersensitivity reaction, consider beta-lactam desensitization; cefazolin may be considered in patients with well-defined non-anaphylactic reaction to penicillin class antibiotics; alternatively, vancomycin or daptomycin​ [b] may be used. Gentamicin is no longer recommended for staphylococcal native valve IE due to concerns with toxicity and lack of supporting data.​ [1] ​ [16] ​ [17] ​ [18] ​ [19] |
| MRSA | Vancomycin | 6 wk | Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​ [c] |
| or |  |  |
| Daptomycin​ [b] | 6 wk | Daptomycin should be used in select patients only.​ [b] The optimal dosing of daptomycin has not been established. |
| Staphylococci—Prosthetic Valve |
| MSSA | Cloxacillin + rifampin + gentamicin ​ [d] | ≥6 wk First 2 wk | Cefazolin may be used in place of cloxacillin. In patients with a beta-lactam type-1 hypersensitivity reaction, consider beta-lactam desensitization; cefazolin may be considered in patients with well-defined non-anaphylactic to penicillin class antibiotics; alternatively, cloxacillin may be replaced by vancomycin. |
| MRSA | Vancomycin + rifampin + gentamicin​ [d] | ≥6 wk First 2 wk | Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​ [c] |

[a] Begin counting when repeat blood cultures confirm clearance of bacteremia.

[b] Daptomycin should be reserved for use in patients with a vancomycin hypersensitivity reaction or those unable to tolerate vancomycin. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies. There is inconclusive evidence to support or refute the use of daptomycin in the presence of pulmonary septic emboli.​[[20]](#controversialDAP)

[c] In some institutions, vancomycin AUC0–24 h/MIC (range 400–600 mg\*h/L) may be calculated with vancomycin trough(s) with/without vancomycin peak(s);​[[21]](#Rybak2020) consult institutions’ vancomycin dosing protocols, if available. To minimize risk of vancomycin nephrotoxicity, avoid vancomycin concentrations >15 mg/L.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[21]](#Rybak2020)

[d] Consider avoiding gentamicin-containing regimen in older patients or those at risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Gentamicin peak and trough concentrations are suggested to be maintained at 3–4 mg/L and <1 mg/L respectively.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[22]](#c0124n1012)​[[23]](#c0124n1013) Concerns with nephrotoxicity and lack of additional efficacy with higher peak levels have led clinicians to recommend these lower gentamicin peak concentrations.​[[24]](#c0124n1014)

### Streptococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for streptococcal endocarditis can be found in [Table 4](#c0124n00030).

Alpha-hemolytic or viridans streptococci account for 20% of IE cases.​[[15]](#c0124n1006) Viridans streptococci include S. mutans, S. oralis (mitis), S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and Gemella morbillorum (formerly called S. morbillorum), S. anginosus group (S. anginosus, *constellatus* and *intermedius*) and S. gallolyticus (formerly called S. bovis).​[[1]](#c0124n1001) Other viridans streptococci include Abiotrophia defectiva and Granulicatella spp.

Most streptococci are sensitive to penicillin; however, tolerance or resistance to penicillin has been reported.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[25]](#c0124n1011) Infective endocarditis due to A. defectiva, Granulicatella spp. or viridans streptococci with MIC >0.5 mg/L may be difficult to cure and should be treated with antibiotic regimens used for enterococcal IE (see [Table 5](#c0124n00033)).

**Table 4:** Treatment of Viridans Group Streptococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) Endocarditis​[[1]](#c0124n1001)

[a] Begin counting when repeat blood cultures confirm clearance of bacteremia.

[b] Consider avoiding gentamicin-containing regimen in older patients or those at risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Gentamicin peak and trough concentrations are suggested to be maintained at 3–4 mg/L and <1 mg/L respectively.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[22]](#c0124n1012)​[[23]](#c0124n1013) Concerns with nephrotoxicity and lack of additional efficacy with higher peak levels have led clinicians to recommend these lower gentamicin peak concentrations.​[[24]](#c0124n1014)

[c] There is no recommended therapeutic range for vancomycin against non-MRSA pathogens (e.g., *Enterococcus* or *Streptococcus* spp.). The suggested range is based on the range used for MRSA.

[d] In some institutions, vancomycin AUC0–24 h/MIC (range 400–600 mg\*h/L) may be calculated with the initial vancomycin trough;​[[21]](#Rybak2020) consult institutions’ vancomycin dosing protocols, if available. To minimize risk of vancomycin nephrotoxicity, avoid vancomycin concentrations >15 mg/L.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[21]](#Rybak2020)

**Abbreviations:**

IE
:   infective endocarditis

MIC
:   minimum inhibitory concentration

MRSA
:   methicillin-resistant S. aureus

### Enterococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for enterococcal endocarditis can be found in [Table 5](#c0124n00033). Choice and duration of the antibiotic regimen depends on the enterococcal spp. and its penicillin or vancomycin susceptibility and/or the presence of high-level gentamicin resistance. Patients with enterococcal IE generally require 4–6 weeks of concomitant beta-lactam and aminoglycoside therapy. Enterococci (e.g., E. faecalis, E. faecium) account for approximately 10% of IE cases.​[[15]](#c0124n1006) Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal endocarditis is uncommon.

**Table 5:** Treatment of Enterococci in Native or Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis​[[1]](#c0124n1001)

| Regimen(s) | Duration​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive to Penicillin, Gentamicin and Vancomycin |
| Ampicillin or penicillin G + gentamicin ​ [b] | 4–6 wk | Native valve: 4-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms of illness <3 months ; 6-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms >3 months . Prosthetic valve: 6-wk therapy recommended. |
| or |  |  |
| Ampicillin + ceftriaxone | 6 wk | Recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute (pre-existing or developing during treatment with a gentamicin-containing regimen). |
| or |  |  |
| Vancomycin​ [c] ​ [d] + gentamicin​ [b] | 6 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. |
| Sensitive to Penicillin, Streptomycin and Vancomycin and Resistant to Gentamicin |
| Ampicillin + ceftriaxone | 6 wk |  |
| or |  |  |
| Ampicillin or penicillin G + streptomycin | 4–6 wk | Native valve: 4-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms of illness <3 months ; 6-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms >3 months . Prosthetic valve: 6-wk therapy recommended. |
| or |  |  |
| Vancomycin​ [c] ​ [d] + streptomycin | 6 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. |
| Sensitive to Aminoglycosides and Vancomycin, Resistant to Penicillin |

| Resistant to Aminoglycosides, Penicillin and Vancomycin |
| Linezolid​ [e] or daptomycin ​ [e] | ≥6 wk | Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal IE may be difficult and is not clearly defined. Various combination regimens including those with daptomycin​ [e] have been suggested, although clinical data remain limited.​ [1] ​ [26] The optimal dosing of daptomycin has not been established. |

[a] Begin counting when repeat blood cultures confirm clearance of bacteremia.

[b] Consider avoiding gentamicin-containing regimen in older patients or those at risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Gentamicin peak and trough concentrations are suggested to be maintained at 3–4 mg/L and <1 mg/L respectively.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[22]](#c0124n1012)​[[23]](#c0124n1013) Concerns with nephrotoxicity and lack of additional efficacy with higher peak levels have led clinicians to recommend these lower gentamicin peak concentrations.​[[24]](#c0124n1014)

[c] There is no recommended therapeutic range for vancomycin against non-MRSA pathogens (e.g., *Enterococcus* or *Streptococcus* spp.). The suggested range is based on the range used for MRSA.

[d] In some institutions, vancomycin AUC0–24 h/MIC (range 400–600 mg\*h/L) may be calculated with the initial vancomycin trough;​[[21]](#Rybak2020) consult institutions’ vancomycin dosing protocols, if available. To minimize risk of vancomycin nephrotoxicity, avoid vancomycin concentrations greater than 15 mg/L.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)​[[21]](#Rybak2020)

[e] These agents should only be used when resistance has been established or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies.

### Gram-Negative Bacteria

Infective endocarditis due to Gram-negative bacteria may account for 2% of cases.​[[15]](#c0124n1006) Identification of the Gram-negative pathogen and susceptibility to antibiotics is important in determining the antibiotic regimen and course. Gram-negative bacteria may be divided into HACEK and non-HACEK group bacteria.

HACEK group organisms are fastidious, slow growing, Gram-negative bacilli that account for approximately 1–2% of IE. HACEK group pathogens include Haemophilus spp. (e.g., H. parainfluenzae), Aggregatibacter spp. (e.g., A. actinomycetemcomitans or A. aphrophilus), Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella spp.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)

When treating HACEK IE, third-generation or higher cephalosporins may be used; however, due to concerns with beta-lactamase production among HACEK strains, ampicillin is *not* recommended. In patients with beta-lactam allergies, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are alternatives. In certain cases where drug-resistance has been demonstrated, carbapenems may be used (e.g., meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin); however, these agents should only be used in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

### Culture-Negative IE

Blood cultures may remain negative in 8% of cases despite radiologic and clinical evidence of IE. Reasons for this may include administration of antibiotic therapy prior to cultures and difficult-to-grow pathogens (e.g., Coxiella burnetii or Bartonella spp.), and nonbacterial or unusual pathogens. Conduct a thorough review of the patient host factors (e.g., immunosuppression, burn), comorbidities (e.g., diabetes), history of IV drug use, animal or insect exposure, indwelling devices, prior surgical procedures, or other possible etiologic causes of culture-negative IE. Histopathology of cardiac tissue may aid in the identification of potential pathogens.​[[27]](#c0124n1016) Serologic and molecular diagnostics may be used to identify pathogens such as C. burnetii, Bartonella, Tropheryma whipplei or Chlamydia spp.​[[1]](#c0124n1001) Select antibiotic therapy based on the most likely pathogen after a review of available patient data. Consult with an infectious disease specialist and clinical microbiologist.

### Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy of IE

Although outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been used to treat IE, consider stringent entry criteria and close patient follow-up for patients receiving OPAT.​[[28]](#c0124n1017)​[[29]](#c0124n1018) In uncomplicated IE patients, OPAT may be used to complete a 4- to 6-week total treatment course, providing proper patient assessment and follow-up is conducted. In general, eligible patients should have received an initial 2 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy administered as an inpatient before initiation of OPAT.​[[28]](#c0124n1017)​[[29]](#c0124n1018) Monitor patients for clinical response, complications and adverse drug effects from antibiotic therapy (e.g., resulting from prolonged aminoglycoside therapy). OPAT may also be used to treat patients who inject drugs (PWID).​[[30]](#IE-MGMT) However, barriers such as low patient acceptance, treatment bias, or availability of support programs or harm reduction programs may limit the broad use of OPAT among the PWID population.​[[30]](#IE-MGMT)

### Intravenous to Oral Antibiotic Therapy of IE

For most patients, IV antibiotics are administered for the entire IE treatment course; however, a 2019 study from Denmark found that patients who received IV antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics to complete the treatment course had similar outcomes to those who received IV therapy for the entire course of treatment.​[[31]](#Iversen-A6D9AA95) At the 6-month follow-up date, stable patients with left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp., E. faecalis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci who were converted to oral combination therapy halfway through their treatment course (median of switch to oral antibiotics: 17 days) had similar outcomes to the IV-only antibiotic group.​[[32]](#IversonSuppl) One limitation of the study was the use of antibiotic combinations that are not commonly used in Canada (e.g., linezolid/moxifloxacin plus rifampin/fusidic acid) or not available (fusidic acid);​[[32]](#IversonSuppl) this will limit applicability.

A 2023 retrospective study found that outcomes among 46 IE patients transitioned from IV to oral antibiotics were similar to patients receiving IV antibiotics only.​[[33]](#infEndo) Depending on the pathogen, a variety of high-dose antibiotics were used.​[[33]](#infEndo)

Oral transition therapy may not be appropriate for all patients with IE. Research pertaining to factors contributing to success or failure with oral transitional therapy is needed.​[[34]](#russellStrat) Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is encouraged in all cases where this conversion to oral therapy is being considered.

. . . . .

### Prevention of Infective Endocarditis

### Managing At-Risk Patients

Concerns about bacteremia and severity of IE led to a consensus among experts over the past 50 years to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with risk factors undergoing procedures known to cause bacteremia.​[[35]](#c0124n1019)​[[36]](#c0124n1020)​[[37]](#c0124n1021)​[[38]](#c0124n1022) Assumptions were made that antibiotic prophylaxis would prevent IE in patients undergoing dental, GI and genitourinary tract procedures; however, there is an absence of randomized controlled trials documenting the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing IE. Most cases of IE cannot be attributed to invasive procedures. Systematic reviews did not find supportive data.​[[39]](#c0124n1023)​[[40]](#c0124n1024) The benefit of widespread antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE is small.​[[41]](#c0124n1025) As a result, revised recommendations limit antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk of adverse outcome from IE (see [Table 6](#c0124n00034)).​[[37]](#c0124n1021)​[[38]](#c0124n1022) A recent review of studies published before and after the 2007 revision in antibiotic prophylaxis protocol did not find evidence of an increase in viridans group streptococci IE.​[[37]](#c0124n1021)

Antibiotic prophylaxis is directed against viridans group streptococci for patients with underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk of adverse outcomes (see [Table 6](#c0124n00034)) undergoing procedures outlined in [Table 7](#c0124n00037). Administer the antibiotic to provide effective serum concentrations at the time of the anticipated bacteremia and for a few hours thereafter.

In a recent review of IE antibiotic prophylaxis, clindamycin was found to be associated with higher incidence of nonfatal and fatal adverse events related to Clostridioides difficile infection.​[[42]](#Thornhill) As a result, clindamycin is no longer recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis in dental procedures. As an alternative, doxycycline may be prescribed in those who cannot tolerate penicillins, cephalosporins or macrolides.​[[37]](#c0124n1021)

**Table 6:** Underlying Conditions for Which Antibiotic Prophylaxis Is Suggested​[[37]](#c0124n1021)

| Underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis is suggested for a dental procedure: Prosthetic cardiac valve or material Presence of cardiac prosthetic valve Transcatheter implantation of prosthetic valves Cardiac valve repair with devices, including annuloplasty, rings or clips Left ventricular assist devices or implantable heart Previous, relapse or recurrent infective endocarditis Congenital heart disease (CHD) Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, including those with palliative shunts and conduits Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device, whether placed by surgery or transcatheter during the first 6 months after the procedure Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device Surgical or transcatheter pulmonary artery valve or conduit placement such as Melody valve and Contegra conduit Cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy | Underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis is not suggested for a dental procedure : Implantable electronic devices such as a pacemaker or similar devices Septal defect closure devices when complete closure is achieved Peripheral vascular grafts and patches, including those used for hemodialysis Coronary artery stents or other vascular stents CNS ventriculoatrial shunts Vena cava filters Pledgets |

If the antibiotic is inadvertently not administered before the procedure, the dose may be administered up to 2 hours after the procedure. This should be reserved only for those patients who did not receive a dose prior to the procedure.

If the patient is already taking an antibiotic that would be used for endocarditis prophylaxis, select an agent from a different class to avoid encountering resistant strains.​[[37]](#c0124n1021) Alternatively, delay the procedure until 10 days or more after completion of the antibiotic course to allow the bacterial flora to return to its usual state.​[[37]](#c0124n1021)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Intravenous therapy is generally considered the route of choice for antimicrobial administration for the treatment of IE. Recent evidence suggests that in carefully selected patients, oral stepdown therapy, utilizing high-dose antibiotics active against the target pathogens, may be a viable option. Consultation with an ID specialist is encouraged.
- When considering the duration of treatment in IE patients with an initial positive blood culture, count the required duration of treatment from the first day the blood culture is negative.​[[1]](#c0124n1001)
- Due to an association with colon cancer, patients with S. gallolyticus (bovis) IE or positive blood cultures should undergo a colonoscopy to investigate for presence of malignancy.​[[43]](#c0124n01128)​[[44]](#c0124n01129)

### Drug Table

**Table 9:** Intravenous Therapy for Infective Endocarditis

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Aminoglycosides**

| gentamicin generics $40–80 | 1 mg/kg Q8H IV or 3 mg/kg once daily IV/IM (for viridans streptococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus [bovis] ) | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity. | Enhanced effects with concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins, e.g., amphotericin B , vancomycin. Increased risk of respiratory depression with neuromuscular blocking agents. | Consider avoiding gentamicin-containing regimen in older patients or those at risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Toxicity risk may increase with prolonged administration and/or concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins. Monitor renal function and serum gentamicin concentrations, especially for prolonged courses. Consider maintaining gentamicin trough concentrations ≤1 mg/L to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity. For enterococcal IE only, gentamicin peak and trough levels of 3–4 mg/L and <1 mg/L, respectively, may be considered. |
| streptomycin generics $80–120 | 7.5 mg/kg Q12H IV/IM | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity. | Enhanced effects with concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins, e.g., amphotericin B , vancomycin. Increased risk of respiratory depression with neuromuscular blocking agents. | Serum concentration assay not commonly available. Toxicity risk may increase with prolonged administration and/or concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins. |

**Drug Class: Cephalosporins**

| cefazolin generics < $40 | 2 g Q8H IV | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, diarrhea. | Possible increased INR with warfarin. |  |
| ceftriaxone generics < $40 | 2 g Q24H IV For Enterococcus faecalis IE, 2 g Q12H IV, combined with ampicillin | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, diarrhea, elevated AST and/or ALT, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis. | Possible increased INR with warfarin. Ceftriaxone binds with IV calcium salts to form an insoluble precipitate. |  |

**Drug Class: Glycopeptides**

| vancomycin generics $120–160 | 15 mg/kg Q12H IV (see Comments) | Thrombophlebitis, rash, fever, anemia, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, vancomycin flushing syndrome. | Increased incidence of nephrotoxicity when used with aminoglycosides. | Monitor vancomycin troughs to maintain concentrations 10–15 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus IE.​ [1] ​ [21] There is no recommended therapeutic range for vancomycin against non-MRSA pathogens (e.g., Enterococcus or Streptococcus spp.); however, MRSA therapeutic ranges are often used for these pathogens. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been reported with higher dosages and vancomycin troughs >15 mg/L . In some institutions, vancomycin AUC 0–24 h /MIC (range 400–600 mg*h/L) may be calculated with vancomycin trough(s) with/without vancomycin peak(s);​ [21] consult institutions’ vancomycin dosing protocols, if available. There is increasing evidence that vancomycin troughs of 10-15 mg/L correlate with AUC 0-24h /MIC of 400-600. ​ [21] |

**Drug Class: Lipopeptides​[b]**

| daptomycin Cubicin , generics $160–200 | 6 mg/kg Q24H IV | Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, thrombophlebitis, injection site pain/reaction, anemia, creatinine kinase elevation, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis. | Consider avoiding concomitant HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor administration as a precaution as daptomycin may increase its levels. | Monitor creatinine kinase weekly at minimum, especially in patients with renal impairment and/or HMG-CoA reductase co-administration. Some experts suggest ≥8 mg/kg Q24H IV for IE. Consider consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Reserved for cases with established resistance or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies. |

**Drug Class: Oxazolidinones​[b]**

| linezolid Zyvoxam , generics PO: < $40 IV: $80–120 | 600 mg Q12H IV/PO | Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia. | MAOI, therefore use caution; evaluate concomitant agents for potential interaction; avoid tyramine-rich foods. | Monitor CBC weekly. Reserved for cases with established resistance or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies. |

**Drug Class: Penicillins**

| penicillin G generics < $40 | 12– 18 million units/day divided Q4–6H IV or 24 million units/day divided Q4–6H IV | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, interstitial nephritis, seizure (high dose). | May increase serum levels of methotrexate. May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. | Use 24 million units per day for viridans streptococci and S. gallolyticus (bovis) in a prosthetic valve IE. |
| ampicillin generics $40–80 | 2 g Q4H IV | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, interstitial nephritis, seizure (high dose). | May increase serum levels of methotrexate. May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. |  |
| cloxacillin generics $80–120 | 2 g Q4H IV | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, interstitial nephritis, seizure (high dose). | May increase serum levels of methotrexate. May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. |  |

**Drug Class: Rifamycins**

| rifampin Rofact , generics IV: ​ [c] PO: < $40 | 300 mg Q8H IV/PO | Rash, orange discoloration of body fluids (e.g., contact lens staining), nausea, vomiting, hepatic toxicity, thrombocytopenia. | Potent inducer of multiple substrates—evaluate when coadministered with other drugs, e.g., may reduce levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, phenytoin, warfarin and oral contraceptives. | Use only in combination with other antibiotics. |
