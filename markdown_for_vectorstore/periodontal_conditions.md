### Pathophysiology

Periodontal disease includes any pathologic process involving the periodontium, the tissues supporting the teeth, which include the cementum, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and gingiva (see [Figure 1](#f602B3C3)).​[[1]](#DentinoALeeSMailhotJHeftiAFPrincipl-9D2A659A) Periodontal diseases are divided into 2 independent categories: gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis is reversible inflammation of the gingiva, whereas periodontitis involves the loss of connective tissue attachment and leads to the resorption of the tooth-supporting bone.​[[2]](#GCatonJArmitageGBergludhTEtAl.ANewC-4D3F5426) Plaque is the most common cause of gingivitis and periodontitis.

Plaque (also referred to as biofilm) is composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in a matrix of bacterial or salivary glycoproteins and dextrans.​[[3]](#FlemmigTF.Periodontitis.AnnPeriodon-BD3BA469)​[[4]](#ClaydonNC.CurrentConceptsInToothbru-BD3BA60A) Plaque accumulates at the gingival or supragingival level.​[[1]](#DentinoALeeSMailhotJHeftiAFPrincipl-9D2A659A)​[[5]](#psc1087n1005)​[[6]](#psc1087n1011)​[[7]](#psc1087n01048) If not disrupted, the plaque matures, inducing an inflammatory reaction that produces by-products that serve as nutrients for gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Concomitantly, the inflammation and bacterial enzymes increase tissue permeability, allowing high molecular weight products from the matrix to penetrate the superficial tissues. This stimulates a host response and the migration of inflammatory and immune cells, e.g., polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. Clinical signs of the disease may be partially explained by the normal inflammatory and immune processes. For example, collagenases from the polymorphonuclear cells and fibroblasts, along with inflammatory mediators (e.g., interleukin-1-beta and prostaglandin E2), may be destructive to the connective tissues and bone.

Eventually, a balance between the bacterial challenge and the host response is achieved, resulting in a chronic inflammatory process known as gingivitis. In the chronic state, gram-negative bacteria are found in the diseased sites.

Little is known about what causes the shift from stable, chronic gingivitis to periodontitis. The induction and progression of periodontitis most likely involves disruption in the balance between the bacteria and the host defenses. The bacterial population may change, or host defenses could be transiently or permanently altered by such things as psychological stress, viral infection or smoking. [Figure 2](#psc1087n00016) illustrates progressive changes in the development of periodontitis. Additionally, many local and systemic factors influence the periodontal inflammatory response to plaque​[[1]](#DentinoALeeSMailhotJHeftiAFPrincipl-9D2A659A)​[[5]](#psc1087n1005)​[[8]](#psc1087n1002)​[[9]](#psc1087n1003)​[[10]](#psc1087n1006) (see [Table 1](#table-1432-9DC592A3)).

### Prevalence

### Gingivitis

Gingivitis is the most common form of periodontal disease. Gingival inflammation in 1 or more sites of the mouth can be seen in most people.​[[1]](#DentinoALeeSMailhotJHeftiAFPrincipl-9D2A659A)​[[12]](#psc1087n1012) Approximately 32% of Canadian adults have gingivitis, as reported by the Oral Health Component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007–2009.​[[13]](#OralComponentOfCanadianHealthSurvey-3F4B4083)

The prevalence and severity of gingivitis vary significantly with age; see [Table 2](#table-11152341-CB5CD180) for details. Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis has a low prevalence in developed countries and a higher one in less developed countries, often affecting malnourished children.​[[14]](#psc1087n1013) In Western countries, it is usually seen in the 16–30 age group.

**Table 2:** Prevalence of Gingivitis Across Age Groups​[[10]](#psc1087n1006)[[14]](#psc1087n1013)[[15]](#psc1087n1009)[[16]](#psc1087n1014)

| Age group (years) | Prevalence of Gingivitis |
| --- | --- |
| 12–14 | 80–100% |
| 15–19 | 79% |
| 20–44 | 54% |
| 45–64 | 44% |
| ≥65 | 65% |

### Periodontitis

The Oral Health Component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007–2009 reports 16% of Canadian adults have moderate periodontitis, while 4% have severe disease;​[[13]](#OralComponentOfCanadianHealthSurvey-3F4B4083) severe periodontitis was identified as the sixth most common disease globally.​[[17]](#GlobalBurdenOfDiseaseStudy2013Colla-9498E7FC) Prevalence was higher in older adults (24%) and people who smoke (22%). In children, periodontal disease is often associated with systemic conditions such as juvenile diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome and many others.​[[14]](#psc1087n1013)

### Risk Factors

The most significant modifiable risk factor for periodontitis is poor oral hygiene. A meta-analysis demonstrated a direct relationship between oral hygiene and periodontitis, with fair and poor hygiene significantly increasing the risk of periodontitis by two‐ and five‐fold, respectively, compared with good oral hygiene.​[[18]](#LertpimonchaiARattanasiriSArj-OngVS-3699B37F)

Both prevalence and severity of periodontal disease increase with age; it appears to become clinically significant in the fourth decade of life.​[[10]](#psc1087n1006)​[[14]](#psc1087n1013) For all age groups, the disease seems to be 1.5 times more prevalent in men than in women. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients*.)

Studies estimate the risk of periodontitis in people who smoke to be 2.5–7 times greater than in those who don’t.​[[5]](#psc1087n1005)​[[19]](#psc1087n1008)

Barriers to dental care increase risk of periodontal disease; this affects people who are racialized, uninsured, low-income or living in rural areas.​[[20]](#NorthridgeMEKumarAKaurR.Disparities-949A8DF7)​[[21]](#EkePIDyeBAWeiLEtAl.UpdateOnPrevalen-949AED15)

Certain disease states (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, vitamin C deficiency, herpes simplex virus) and medications (e.g., hormones, anticholinergics, phenytoin, cyclosporine) may increase risk of periodontal disease.​[[22]](#ChappleILCMealeyBLVanDykeTEEtAl.Per-3F4FB0D3)​[[23]](#JepsenSCatonJGAlbandarJMEtAl.Period-3F4E006B)​[[24]](#NajeebSZafarMSKhurshidZEtAl.TheRole-369A6011)​[[25]](#FeiLiZhuCeDengFYEtAl.HerpesvirusInE-369A48B9) See [Table 1](#table-1432-9DC592A3) for more information on contributing factors to periodontal disease.

It is difficult to reliably predict who will progress from gingivitis to periodontitis. Considerable variations have been found in the clinical presentation and the rates of disease progression of chronic periodontitis.​[[14]](#psc1087n1013)

### Consequences of Periodontal Disease on Systemic Health

The evidence linking periodontal disease and systemic health continues to grow. The proposed mechanism suggests that the bacterial load from periodontal disease contributes to systemic inflammation, which in turn contributes to systemic disease; the relationship has become more apparent for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease and pregnancy complications.​[[26]](#GencoRJSanzM.ClinicalAndPublicHealt-949C45E0)​[[27]](#HerreraDSanzMShapiraLEtAl.Periodont-B27F81C2) Periodontitis has also been associated with metabolic disorders and obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers, thyroid disease, migraines and dementia.​[[26]](#GencoRJSanzM.ClinicalAndPublicHealt-949C45E0)​[[28]](#NiJDanBLeiF.TheEffectsOfThyroidFunc-B2800742)​[[29]](#SajiNMatsushitaKTakedaAEtAl.Associa-B2802757)​[[30]](#YanLHuangYXieBEtAl.AssociationOfPer-B280487A)

### Cardiovascular Disease

Periodontitis and CVD share some common epidemiological, genetic and environmental risk factors, such as systemic inflammation and smoking. Periodontitis increases the risk of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease and associated mortality. While no studies have shown a decreased risk of CVD from periodontitis care, there is a clear benefit on surrogate markers such as BP and arterial stiffness.​[[27]](#HerreraDSanzMShapiraLEtAl.Periodont-B27F81C2)

### Diabetes

The relationship between periodontitis and diabetes is bidirectional. Hyperglycemia promotes inflammation and hinders the healing process in periodontitis, while periodontitis worsens glycemic control, as indicated by hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and increases the risk of developing diabetes. Conversely, good glycemic control promotes healing in periodontitis, and periodontal treatment improves HbA1C.​[[27]](#HerreraDSanzMShapiraLEtAl.Periodont-B27F81C2)​[[31]](#SimpsonTCWeldonJCWorthingtonHVEtAl.-BDA2D18A)

### Respiratory Disease

Patients with periodontitis have a higher risk of developing COPD, and patients with COPD and periodontitis may experience a greater decline in lung function. Periodontitis is also associated with a higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with periodontitis have an increased chance of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection; those who do have a higher risk of mechanical ventilation and death. The association of periodontitis with asthma and community-acquired pneumonia is still unclear.​[[27]](#HerreraDSanzMShapiraLEtAl.Periodont-B27F81C2)

### Pregnancy

Periodontitis during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of low-birth weight infants and preterm birth.​[[32]](#JakovljevicASljivancaninJakovljevic-B2816658) Periodontitis also appears to be a significant risk factor for preeclampsia.​[[32]](#JakovljevicASljivancaninJakovljevic-B2816658)​[[33]](#LeQAAkhterRCoultonKmetAl.Periodonti-B28181F0)

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce etiologic factors to reduce or eliminate inflammation
- Prevent progression of periodontal disease and tooth loss
- Restore and maintain optimal gingival and periodontal health
- Motivate the patient to maintain a rigorous oral hygiene routine

### Patient Assessment

Periodontal disease is assessed and managed by dentists, dental hygienists and periodontists. Encourage patients to maintain good oral hygiene and to see their oral health-care provider regularly. The recommended frequency varies according to the needs of each patient, but is never less than once yearly. For the classification of periodontal disease, see [Table 3](#psc1087n00007).

### Gingivitis

Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingiva. The most common form of gingivitis is plaque-induced gingivitis.​[[34]](#psc1087n1015)​[[35]](#psc1087n1025)​[[36]](#psc1087n1026) There are many other subtypes of gingivitis, but they all share similar characteristics; see [Table 3](#psc1087n00007).

### Periodontitis

Periodontitis usually involves progression of gingivitis to include gingival attachment loss, loss of bone and pocketing (abnormally increased depth of spaces between teeth and gingiva).​[[34]](#psc1087n1015)​[[37]](#psc1087n1023)​[[38]](#psc1087n1024) For more information, see [Table 3](#psc1087n00007).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

### Gingivitis

Plaque control is the gold standard of treatment for gingivitis induced by dental plaque (see Oral Hygiene, Dental Plaque and Caries). To prevent progression to periodontitis and even eliminate gingivitis, encourage patients with gingivitis to adhere to the oral hygiene regimen recommended by their dentist. Evidence suggests that toothbrushing in addition to flossing regularly reduces gingivitis.​[[41]](#SambunjakDNickersonJWPoklepovicTEtA-BDB0FE45) Destruction of supragingival plaque through frequent professional cleaning and good oral hygiene has been associated with a beneficial effect on the subgingival bacterial population in moderately deep pockets.​[[15]](#psc1087n1009) In addition, dental interventions such as scaling and root planing have been shown to reactivate protective antibodies.

### Periodontitis

Periodontitis is treated by dental professionals. Encourage patients who are undergoing treatment for periodontitis to keep their scheduled dental appointments and to adhere to prescribed therapy. The progression of most periodontal diseases can be delayed or reversed if the treatment plan achieves the following objectives:​[[42]](#PreusHRAl-LamiABaelumV.OralHygieneR-94A1D22E)

- Removal of the causative factors
- Reduction or elimination of all pockets and establishment of a normal sulcus depth
- Restoration of physiologic gingival and bone architecture
- Establishment of a functional occlusion by occlusal adjustment and restorative procedure
- Maintenance of periodontal health through adequate plaque control by the patient and regular visits to the dentist for close follow-up and early intervention, in case of recurrence

To achieve these objectives, the following interventions may be required:

- Phase I

  - Hygiene and restorative treatment: This includes routine dental cleaning and oral hygiene patient education. It may include the removal of plaque-retentive areas, tooth extractions and other minimally invasive measures. Interdental brushes, oral irrigators and powered toothbrushes have all been associated with improved periodontal health.​[[43]](#CostaFOCostaAACotaLOM.TheUseOfInter-8245549A)​[[44]](#PitchikaVPinkCColzkeHEtAl.Long-term-82456D69)
- Phase II

  - Surgical treatment: This includes all procedures designed to reduce or eliminate pockets by resecting or relocating the gingival margin. It may also include the correction of alveolar bone defects and mucogingival defects.
- Phase III

  - Restorative treatment: When indicated, this involves completion of occlusal adjustment, operative dentistry, replacement of missing tooth or teeth by fixed and/or removable prostheses, placement of dental implants, and permanent splinting.
- Phase IV

  - Maintenance treatment: Patients must continue maintenance therapy for their lifetime. Patients who have been diagnosed with moderate to advanced periodontitis may require maintenance recalls as often as every 3 months. The interval between recall appointments is dictated by the level of disease control achieved by the patient at home.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

### Gingivitis

If plaque control cannot be achieved manually (e.g., due to lack of dexterity) or in patients who are systemically compromised or postoperative, topical antimicrobial products may be used as an adjunct to regular plaque-control measures. Chlorhexidine is effective for the treatment of mild gingivitis.​[[45]](#JamesPWorthingtonHVParnellCEtAl.Chl-369BDEC2) For more information, see [Table 4](#drugTable-119-42EDCE68).

Triclosan has shown moderate efficacy in vivo.​[[46]](#psc1087n1033) Commercially available toothpastes containing triclosan may reduce gingival inflammation and bleeding.​[[47]](#RileyPLamontT.TriclosancopolymerCon-BDB080D3) For more information, see Dentifrices.

### Periodontitis

### Dental Office Procedures

The effectiveness of scaling and root planing may be slightly increased when combined with irrigation of the crevice with an antimicrobial agent such as chlorhexidine or povidone/​iodine irrigation solution;​[[48]](#psc1087n1028)​[[49]](#psc1087n1029)​[[50]](#EberhardJJepsenSJervoe-StormPMEtAl.-BDAA8A59) however, they may stain the teeth. Iodine derivatives are rarely used in modern practice; they are contraindicated in pregnant or nursing patients, in patients with sensitivity to iodine, and those at risk of hypothyroidism.​[[51]](#psc1087n1030)

Chlorine-releasing agents (e.g., sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide chloramines-T) have also been employed in periodontal therapy, although evidence for their long-term efficacy and safety is lacking.​[[52]](#GalvanMGonzalezSCohenCLEtAl.Periodo-BDA5BBB0)

### Topical Antibacterials

As an adjunct to tooth brushing and flossing, some dental practitioners recommend the use of **chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash** to reduce levels of periodontal pathogens in saliva. Chlorhexidine has shown efficacy against a broad-spectrum of bacteria, good adherence to tooth surfaces and oral mucosa, and a low potential for irritation.​[[53]](#psc1087n1032)​[[54]](#DaCostaLFNPAmaralCDSFBarbiratoDDSEt-369CD1AE) For more information, see [Table 4](#drugTable-119-42EDCE68).

Anti-infective agents may also be placed subgingivally in vehicles that will allow slow release of the agent into the periodontal pocket. Agents studied include chlorhexidine chips,​[[55]](#psc1087n1035) tetracycline fibres, doxycycline gel,​[[56]](#psc1087n1036) minocycline gel and metronidazole gel. Only **doxycycline gel** (Atridox) is currently available in Canada. Studies have shown little benefit when these products were used as adjuncts to mechanical therapy.​[[57]](#HanesPJPurvisJP.LocalAnti-infective-BDAC6784)​[[58]](#BonitoAJLuxLLohrKN.ImpactOfLocalAdj-BDAD1E9D) They are not recommended as monotherapy.​[[34]](#psc1087n1015)​[[59]](#psc1087n1034)​[[60]](#psc1087n01050)​[[61]](#SmileyCJTracySLAbtEEtAl.Evidence-ba-9D414B52)

Investigational treatments for periodontal disease include baking soda dentifrice, sodium hypochlorite rinse and topical/oral probiotics.​[[62]](#SabharwalAScannapiecoFA.BakingSodaD-369E9CF6)​[[63]](#Martin-CabezasRDavideauJLTenenbaumH-369ED080)​[[64]](#SlotsJ.PeriodontitisFactsFallaciesA-369EFCD1) Further research is necessary before these therapies can be recommended.

### Systemic Antibacterials

Patients with plaque-induced gingivitis or chronic periodontitis usually respond well to mechanical periodontal therapy. While little additional benefit is expected from the use of a topical anti-infective agent, patients with severe disease may benefit from adjunctive systemic antibacterial therapy.​[[48]](#psc1087n1028)​[[61]](#SmileyCJTracySLAbtEEtAl.Evidence-ba-9D414B52)​[[65]](#psc1087n1037) The goal of systemic antimicrobial therapy is to destroy subgingival microorganisms that remain after local treatment. The best candidates for systemic antibacterial therapy are patients with continuing loss of periodontal attachment despite appropriate local therapy, refractory periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, medical conditions predisposing to periodontitis, or acute or severe periodontal infections, e.g., periodontal abscess, acute necrotizing gingivitis/periodontitis.​[[48]](#psc1087n1028)​[[65]](#psc1087n1037) Updated European guidelines recommend systemic therapy only in young patients (<40 years) with rapidly progressing severe periodontitis.​[[66]](#SanzMHerreraDKebschullMEtAl.Treatme-9873144D)​[[67]](#PalmerNOFacultyOfGeneralDentalPract-94A44D55)

Several antimicrobial regimens have been studied in randomized controlled trials with no clear evidence to support one specific regimen.​[[68]](#KhattriSNagrajSKAroraAEtAl.Adjuncti-9873D6CB) Experts recommend the combination of metronidazole and amoxicillin as first-line therapy; second- and third-line options include azithromycin and doxycycline.​[[67]](#PalmerNOFacultyOfGeneralDentalPract-94A44D55)​[[69]](#TeughelsWFeresMOudVEtAl.AdjunctiveE-94A704E0) Last-line options include fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.​[[65]](#psc1087n1037)​[[70]](#HerreraDAlonsoBDeArribaLEtAl.AcuteP-9D4658A2) Clindamycin is no longer recommended as a first-line option in penicillin-allergic patients due to increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infections and limited efficacy in odontogenic infections.​[[67]](#PalmerNOFacultyOfGeneralDentalPract-94A44D55)​[[71]](#ThornhillMHDayerMJDurkinMJEtAl.Risk) The adult oral dosages of antibacterials commonly prescribed for treatment of periodontitis are presented in [Table 5](#dt_ARforPeriodontitis).

The benefits of systemic antibiotics for periodontal abscesses are unclear;​[[72]](#CopeAFrancisNWoodFEtAl.SystemicAnti-BDAFF717) therefore, patient selection for therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, particularly if signs of systemic infection are present.​[[67]](#PalmerNOFacultyOfGeneralDentalPract-94A44D55)​[[70]](#HerreraDAlonsoBDeArribaLEtAl.AcuteP-9D4658A2) The adult oral dosages of antibacterials commonly prescribed for treatment of acute periodontal abscesses are presented in [Table 5](#dt_ARforPeriodontitis).

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Pregnancy

Hormonal changes during pregnancy increase risk of gingivitis and periodontal disease.​[[73]](#Gonzales-JaranayMTellezLRoa-LopezAE-36CAA66C) Regular dental care during pregnancy is recommended.​[[74]](#AmericanCollegeOfObstetriciansAndGy-36CA83BE) Oral radiography is considered safe in pregnancy, as long as appropriate shielding and protection is provided (e.g., lead apron, thyroid collar, high-speed films).​[[75]](#GiglioJALanniSMLaskinDMEtAl.OralHea-4D412CAC) Pregnant patients requiring essential and/or emergency treatment should receive the minimum number of x-rays needed for diagnostic purposes; elective x-rays should be deferred until after pregnancy.​[[76]](#CDAPositionOnControlOfX-radiationIn-4D410E26)

The pharmacologic management of periodontal disease during pregnancy should be similar to management in the general population, with a few exceptions. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are not recommended for dental or periodontal conditions during pregnancy; penicillins are preferable.​[[77]](#OralHealthCareDuringPregnancyANatio-36CAD011) Chlorhexidine mouth rinse is considered safe in pregnancy. When considering mouth rinses for pregnant patients, always recommend alcohol-free formulations.

### Breastfeeding

The pharmacologic management of periodontal disease during breastfeeding should be similar to management in the general population, with a few exceptions. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines have traditionally been contraindicated in breastfeeding due to concerns of adverse effects on joint development and dental enamel staining, respectively.​[[78]](#DrugAndLactationDatabaseLactMed.Ava-8EB1736E) Penicillins may be preferable options. If an antibiotic is initiated, advise the patient to monitor the infant for adverse effects (e.g., change in stool pattern/frequency, thrush, diaper rash). Chlorhexidine mouth rinse is considered safe in breastfeeding patients.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use During Pregnancy and Drug Use During Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Monitoring of Therapy

- Monitor the patient’s use of chlorhexidine mouthwash to help minimize staining due to prolonged use; limit duration of therapy to 2–3 weeks at a time.
- Monitor the patient’s use of oral antimicrobials when prescribed to ensure compliance and identification of possible major adverse effects (e.g., C. difficile).
- Monitor for bleeding of the gingiva. If it occurs spontaneously, refer to a dental practitioner as soon as possible. If bleeding occurs upon toothbrushing, advise patient to discuss with dental practitioner at next follow-up visit.
- Monitor for swelling, redness and pain of the gingiva. If severity increases, refer to a dental practitioner as soon as possible.

| azithromycin Zithromax , Azithromycin , other generics $5–10 | Periodontitis: 500 mg daily PO × 3 days Acute periodontal abscess: loading dose of 1 g PO, followed by 500 mg daily PO × 3 days After 3 days, evaluate patient to determine whether further antibiotic therapy or dosage adjustment is required | Infrequent GI disturbance. | May increase concentration of colchicine, dabigatran, warfarin; dose adjustments and/or close clinical monitoring are recommended. Increased risk of rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, atorvastatin. Avoid combining with highest-risk QT c prolonging agents, e.g., amiodarone, escitalopram, fluoxetine. |

**Drug Class: Nitroimidazoles**

| metronidazole Flagyl Capsules , generics < $5 | Periodontitis: 250–500 mg TID PO × 5 days | GI upset, urethral burning, discoloration of urine (dark or reddish-brown). | Disulfiram-like reaction with alcohol may occur during treatment. Increased concentration of warfarin; dose adjustments and/or close clinical monitoring are recommended. Avoid combining with highest-risk QT c prolonging agents, e.g., amiodarone, escitalopram, fluoxetine. |

**Drug Class: Penicillins**

| amoxicillin generics < $5 | Periodontitis: 500 mg TID PO × 5 days Acute periodontal abscess: loading dose of 1 g PO, followed by 500 mg TID PO × 3 days After 3 days, evaluate patient to determine whether further antibiotic therapy or dosage adjustment is required | Usually well tolerated. Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from minor rashes to anaphylactic shock). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. | Penicillins may increase serum concentration of methotrexate and decrease serum concentration of the active metabolite of mycophenolate. Tetracyclines may decrease the therapeutic effect of penicillins. |

**Drug Class: Tetracyclines**

| doxycycline Doxycycline , other generics < $5 | Periodontitis: 100 mg BID x 1 day, followed by 100 mg once daily PO × 5 days | GI effects; yeast overgrowth; photosensitivity; may increase risk of azotemia; pseudotumor cerebri; avoid in children and pregnant patients. | Serum concentrations of tetracyclines may be reduced by antacids, calcium, magnesium and iron salts, carbamazepine, chronic alcohol ingestion, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Methotrexate concentrations may be increased by tetracyclines. Avoid combining with retinoic acid derivatives, due to increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri. |
