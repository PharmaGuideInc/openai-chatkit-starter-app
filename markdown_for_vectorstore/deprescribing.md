### Introduction

Deprescribing is the planned and supervised process of dose reduction or stopping of medication that might be causing harm, is no longer providing benefit or does not align with a person’s health-care goals or treatment preferences. Deprescribing can also include switching to a safer class of medication.The goal of deprescribing is to reduce pill burden and improve patient outcomes.​[[1]](#ThompsonWFarrellB.DeprescribingWhat-C747B702) Some patients might achieve total discontinuation, whereas others might reach a minimal dose that optimizes the benefit/harm ratio. Deprescribing is part of appropriate prescribing.

### Principles of Deprescribing

Polypharmacy is most commonly described as taking 5 or more medications daily.​[[2]](#MasnoonNShakibSKalisch-EllettLEtAl.-C8552975) It is associated with an increased risk of falls,​[[3]](#DhalwaniNNFahamiRSathanapallyHEtAl.-C747FF11)​[[4]](#JamiesonHANishtalaPSScraseREtAl.Dru-C7484402) hospitalization​[[5]](#WangKNBellJSChenEYHEtAl.Medications-C748810B) and death,​[[6]](#LeelakanokNHolcombeALLundBCEtAl.Ass-C748BE6D) especially in older persons.

Studies have demonstrated that deprescribing a chronic medication is safe for most patients, although symptom reoccurrence is possible.​[[7]](#ThioSLNamJVanDrielMLEtAl.EffectsOfD-C748F334)​[[8]](#IbrahimKCoxNJStevensonJMEtAl.ASyste-85D925DC)​[[9]](#KuaCHMakVSLeeSWH.HealthOutcomesOfDe-85D97BD2) It is therefore important to determine when it is appropriate to deprescribe and which approach should be taken.

Desprescribing is a chance to discuss medication options with patients.​[[10]](#FarrellBManginD.DeprescribingIsAnEs-85DBA2D9) Several frameworks or approaches for deprescribing have been proposed. A popular general approach to deprescribing includes: (1) identifying all medications a person is taking and the reasons, (2) considering the risk of drug-related harm in the individual patient, (3) assessing the indication and benefits (actual or future) versus harms of each drug as well as patient preferences, (4) prioritizing drugs for potential discontinuation and (5) implementing a plan and monitor.​[[11]](#ScottIAHilmerSNReeveEEtAl.ReducingI-85DC96AD)

This generic approach can be used to go over a patient’s entire medication list, e.g., during a medication review. However, it may not be possible to carry out all steps or address all medications at one visit.​[[10]](#FarrellBManginD.DeprescribingIsAnEs-85DBA2D9) Deprescribing can be conducted longitudinally and iteratively​[[10]](#FarrellBManginD.DeprescribingIsAnEs-85DBA2D9) or providers can focus on deprescribing one medication at a time.

Various tools have been developed to assist with deprescribing​[[12]](#ReeveE.DeprescribingToolsAReviewOfT-865C6860) and include the Beers Criteria​[[13]](#AmericanGeriatricsSocietyBeersCrite-C74BC271) and STOPP/START​[[14]](#OMahoneyDcherubiniAGuiterasEtAl.STOPP-85DA41F1) criteria to identify potentially harmful or unnecessary medications for older persons. Evidence-based guidelines for deprescribing 5 medication classes have been developed by or in collaboration with members of the deprescribing.org team. The guidelines provide a stepwise approach for deprescribing the following medications:

- Antihyperglycemics​[[15]](#FarrellBBlackCThompsonWEtAl.Depresc-C74949D9) (see [Figure 1](#AntihyperglycemicDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F34BA3F))
- Antipsychotics​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC) (see [Figure 2](#AntipsychoticsDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F34A2D9))
- Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs)​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5) (see [Figure 3](#BZRADeprescribingAlgorithm-A13C2DD1))
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs)/memantine (in conjunction with the University of Sydney, Australia)​[[19]](#ReeveEFarrellBThompsonWEtAl.Evidenc-C74AD822) (see [Figure 4](#CHEIsMemantineDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F3485E3))
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)​[[20]](#FarrellBPottieKThompsonWEtAl.Depres-C7491B4F) (see [Figure 5](#fig_id))

These guidelines and other resources can be found on the [deprescribing.org](https://deprescribing.org) website.

It is important for clinicians to engage in conversations with their patients about possible deprescribing, which may include topics such as the potential benefits, harms and patient preferences. When properly informed and supported by a health-care professional, many patients will be interested in pursuing the deprescribing of a chronic medication and may successfully stop or reduce a medication dose.​[[21]](#MartinPTamblynRBenedettiAEtAl.Effec-C74B2CAE)​[[22]](#TannenbaumCMartinPTamblynREtAl.Redu-C74B568E)

### Antihyperglycemics

Treatment of diabetes in older adults must be individualized. While appropriate glucose control with antihyperglycemics reduces the risk of diabetes-related complications in adults and in the young-old (>65 to 74 y), there is no evidence for their benefit in older adults who are frail, have major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) or a limited life expectancy. Consider deprescribing antihyperglycemics in this latter group of patients. The goal of deprescribing in this patient group is to minimize the negative effects of diabetes and to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

This guideline includes an algorithm (see [Figure 1](#AntihyperglycemicDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F34BA3F)) that can assist clinicians in deprescribing antihyperglycemics.

### Selecting Patients

The guideline recommends deprescribing antihyperglycemics in all older adults (>65 y) taking 1 or more antihyperglycemic medications to treat type 2 diabetes and who meet any of the following criteria:​[[15]](#FarrellBBlackCThompsonWEtAl.Depresc-C74949D9)

- Patient at risk of hypoglycemia (due to advancing age, comorbidities)
- Patient at risk or experiencing adverse effects from the medication
- Benefit to patient is uncertain due to frailty, major neurocognitive disorder or limited life expectancy

### Approach

Before deprescribing antihyperglycemics, ensure that the patient’s HbA1C is within the recommended range (according to age, life expectancy, comorbidities, frailty) and that potential contributors (e.g., not eating, drug interactions) to hypoglycemia have been considered.​[[15]](#FarrellBBlackCThompsonWEtAl.Depresc-C74949D9)

The guideline recommends reducing or stopping medications that are known to cause hypoglycemia (e.g., sulfonylurea, insulin), switching to another agent with a lower risk of hypoglycemia, and reducing the dose of renally eliminated antihyperglycemics (e.g., metformin, sitagliptin).

### Monitoring

Patients should be monitored after each dose reduction according to the monitoring parameters outlined in [Table 1](#Monitoring_Management_of_ADEs_with_Continued_or_Deprescribed_Antihyperglycemics); the effects of thiazolidinedione (TZD) dose changes may take up to 12 weeks.​[[15]](#FarrellBBlackCThompsonWEtAl.Depresc-C74949D9) Parameters to monitor include hyperglycemia (excessive thirst or urination, fatigue) and hypoglycemia. Frequency of blood glucose monitoring can be increased during the deprescribing process, if needed. Note that changes in a patient’s HbA1C level might not be seen for several months.

**Table 1:** Monitoring Parameters of Expected ADEs and Recommended Management when Antihyperglycemics are Continued or Deprescribed

| Continued Antihyperglycemics | Deprescribed Antihyperglycemics | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hypoglycemia continues Other risks related to hypoglycemia increased by frailty and cognitive impairment/dementia Adverse effects continue |  | Deprescribe: stop, reduce dose or switch to another agent Reduce dose further or try another deprescribing strategy |
|  | Symptomatic hyperglycemia (polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, fatigue, falls, renal insufficiency) or blood glucose exceeds individual target | Return to previous dose or consider alternate drug with lower risk of hypoglycemia Alternate drugs (lower risk of hypoglycemia) Switch from glyburide to non-sulfonylurea Change NPH or mixed insulin to detemir or glargine insulin to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia |

### Antipsychotics

When antipsychotics are initiated to manage the behavioural and psychological symptoms of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) (BPSD), they often become long-term therapy. Evidence supports the benefits of antipsychotic treatment but also acknowledges an increased risk of adverse effects including somnolence and gait abnormality.​[[23]](#MaHHuangYCongZWangYJiangWGaoSZhuG.T-AAFCED86) The potential harm (including an increased overall risk of death) is higher with prolonged use. In older adults, the patient (or caregiver) and health-care provider should collaborate to carefully evaluate the decision to deprescribe. If it is agreed that the medication be continued, it is important to regularly reassess the ongoing need, as —behavioural symptoms tend to change over time and evidence is lacking for long-term use in many patients.​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC)

Evidence for the effectiveness of antipsychotics for the treatment of insomnia is poor and of low quality. Patients taking antipsychotics for insomnia may have an increased risk of harm similar to those with BPSD. Consider discussing deprescribing with patients taking antipsychotics for insomnia.

The guideline includes an algorithm (see [Figure 2](#AntipsychoticsDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F34A2D9)) to help clinicians determine how to deprescribe antipsychotics.

### Selecting Patients

The guideline recommends deprescribing antipsychotics in:

- Adults with BPSD who have been treated for at least 3 months and whose symptoms have stabilized or who have had no response to an adequate trial​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC)
- Patients with primary insomnia who have been treated for any duration or in those with secondary insomnia in which the underlying comorbidities are under control

### Approach

For adults with BPSD treated for at least 3 months (symptoms stabilized or no response to adequate trial), the original antipsychotic dose can be reduced to 75%, 50% then 25% on a biweekly basis before discontinuing.​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC)

For those with primary insomnia treated for any duration or secondary insomnia in which underlying comorbidities are managed, tapering is not required. The antipsychotic can be stopped and patients should be counselled about nonpharmacologic approaches, i.e., sleep hygiene.

These recommendations do not apply to those who have been prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of psychiatric, developmental, addiction or neurological disorders.

### Monitoring

Close monitoring (every 1–2 wk) is essential during the tapering process. Patients with higher baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms who were receiving higher doses of antipsychotics may require more frequent monitoring. The use of objective measures, such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) subscales, can confirm clinical observations and help to identify any behavioural recurrence or withdrawal symptoms and assess the success of deprescribing. Use of NPI may not be practical in many settings. It is also important to monitor for expected benefits of deprescribing (see [Table 2](#Antipsychotics_Monitoring_ExpectedBenefitsADWE_ManagementTable)).​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC) Consider providing patient and/or caregiver a health-care provider’s contact information in case of recurrence of behaviours.

**Table 2:** Monitoring Parameters of Expected Benefits, ADWEs and Recommended Management​[[16]](#BjerreLMFarrellBHogelMEtAl.Deprescr-C749A9FC)

| Expected Benefits | Adverse Drug Withdrawal Events (ADWEs) | Management of ADWEs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Improved cognition, alertness, function, gait Reduced falls, extrapyramidal symptoms | Psychosis, agitation, aggression, delusion, hallucination Especially with severe baseline symptoms | Consider nondrug approaches (e.g., music therapy, behavioural management strategies) Address physical or other disease factors (pain, infection) Consider environment (noise, light) Review medications that might be worsening symptoms If resurgence of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, restart antipsychotic at lowest dose possible with retrial of deprescribing in 3 months (at least 2 attempts) Consider change to risperidone, olanzapine or aripiprazole |
|  | Insomnia relapse | Minimize use of substances that worsen insomnia (caffeine, alcohol) Consider nondrug behavioural approaches: follow primary care or institutional care sleep hygiene and recommendations Alternate drugs: Other medications may be used; see antipsychotics deprescribing guideline​ [16] for details |

### Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists

Treatment guidelines recommend BZRAs (e.g., benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zopiclone) be used for up to only 4 weeks for adult insomnia.​[[24]](#TowardOptimizedPracticeTOPInsomniaG-C74D79D2) Data suggest that BZRA efficacy can diminish in as little as 4 weeks.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5) The [Choosing Wisely Canada](https://choosingwiselycanada.org/geriatrics/) campaign and the Beers Criteria​[[13]](#AmericanGeriatricsSocietyBeersCrite-C74BC271) advocate avoiding BZRAs as first-line therapy for insomnia in older adults. While the benefits of BZRAs are limited with an additional 34.2 minutes of sleep, their risks are well documented and include falls, memory impairment, daytime sedation and motor vehicle accidents, especially in older patients. The number needed to treat (NNT) is 13 while the number needed to harm (NNH) is 6.​[[17]](#GlassJLanctotK-A627F671)​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

Evidence shows that up to 80% of patients can achieve cessation of their BZRA through a deprescribing intervention.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5) A slow tapering of BZRAs improves cessation rates at 3 and 12 months (compared with continuation or usual care) with no difference in withdrawal symptom scores.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

The guideline includes an algorithm to help clinicians determine how to deprescribe BZRAs (see [Figure 3](#BZRADeprescribingAlgorithm-A13C2DD1)).

### Selecting Patients

The BZRA deprescribing algorithm in [Figure 3](#BZRADeprescribingAlgorithm-A13C2DD1) applies only to patients with primary insomnia or with a managed underlying comorbidity. For other patients (e.g., those with untreated anxiety), the BZRA should be maintained or continued until the underlying condition is managed. Deprescribing is recommended for all patients 65 years of age or older, regardless of BZRA duration, and for adults 18–64 years of age taking a BZRA for >4 weeks.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

It is important for clinicians and patients to discuss the risks of ongoing BZRA use, the potential benefits of discontinuation, the limited therapeutic effect, and the mild but short-term withdrawal effects that may occur during tapering (see [Table 3](#BZRADiscussionTable)).​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

**Table 3:** Discussion Points with Patients on Ongoing BZRA Use vs. Deprescribing​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

| Ongoing BZRA Use | Deprescribing |
| --- | --- |
| Risk of falls | Potential reduction in fall risk |
| Memory impairment | Improvement in thinking and memory |
| Risk of motor vehicle accident | Less daytime sedation |
| Therapeutic effect lost after 4 wk of continuous use | Withdrawal effects (insomnia, anxiety) during tapering are mild and short term (a few days to a few weeks) |
| Risks increase in older persons | No difference in problems sleeping at 12 months compared with continuation |

### Approach

There are no studies comparing different tapering approaches. The recommended approach is to slowly taper doses in collaboration with the patient. Strategies usually include gradual dose reductions by approximately 25% every 2 weeks then by 12.5% every 2 weeks near the end, followed by planned periodic drug-free nights.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5) See [Table 4](#BZRA_TaperTable) for an example. If the dosage form of the current BZRA does not allow for the required tapered doses, consider requesting an extemporaneously compounded preparation or switching to lorazepam or oxazepam (see Benzodiazepines [CPhA Monograph] for equivalent doses). Some patients, e.g., those on higher doses, taking a BZRA for a longer duration or having a history of psychological distress, are more likely to have a higher risk of relapse and may require a slower taper.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5) Switching to a long-acting benzodiazepine, such as diazepam, has not demonstrated improved cessation rates or a reduction in the incidence of withdrawal effects compared to tapering short-acting BZRAs.​[[25]](#SchweizerERickelsKCaseWGEtAl.Long-t-C74DDB4A)

**Table 4:** Example of BZRA Taper

| Current Dose =Oxazepam 30 mg HS | Weeks | Suggested Theoretical Oxazepam Dose​[a] | Suggested Practical Oxazepam Dose Using10 mgTablets​[a]​[b] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | 22.5 mg HS | 2 ½ tablets HS or 2 tablets HS |
| 3–4 | 17.5 mg HS | 2 tablets HS or 1 ½ tablets HS |
| 5–6 | 12.5 mg HS | 1 ½ tablets HS or 1 tablet HS |
| 7–8 | 10 mg HS | 1 tablet HS |
| 9–10 | 7.5 mg HS | Alternate 1 tablet HS 4/7 and ½ tablet HS 3/7 or Alternate 1 tablet HS 3/7 and ½ tablet HS 4/7 |
| 11–12 | 7.5 mg HS Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun and 5 mg HS Tue, Thu, Sat | Alternate 1 tablet HS 2/7 and ½ tablet HS 5/7 |
| 13–14 | 7.5 mg HS Mon, Fri and 5 mg HS Tue, Wed, Thu, Sat, Sun | Alternate 1 tablet HS 1/7 and ½ tablet HS 6/7 |
| 15–16 | 5 mg HS | ½ tablet HS |
| 17–18 | 5 mg HS Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun | ½ tablet HS 6/7 |
| 19–20 | 5 mg HS Mon, Wed, Thu, Sat, Sun | ½ tablet HS 5/7 |
| 21–22 | 5 mg HS Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun | ½ tablet HS 4/7 |
| 23–24 | 5 mg HS Mon, Wed, Fri | ½ tablet HS 3/7 |
| 25–26 | 5 mg HS Mon, Thu | ½ tablet HS 2/7 |
| 27–28 | 5 mg HS Mon | ½ tablet HS 1/7 |

[a] If insomnia reoccurs or if withdrawal symptoms are bothersome at any dose, consider maintaining the dose for 1–2 weeks, then continue with a slower taper.​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

[b] Dose needs to be determined with prescriber and/or pharmacist in collaboration with the patient.

Guidelines for insomnia management recommend cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as a first-line intervention (see Insomnia).​[[24]](#TowardOptimizedPracticeTOPInsomniaG-C74D79D2)​[[26]](#QaseemAKansagaraDForcieaMAEtAl.Mana-C74DFE68) At any point, if insomnia persists the patient can be counselled on sleep hygiene or referred to either in-person or online CBT-I (see [Other Resources](#BZRAsOtherResources)). Although combining CBT with taper has demonstrated higher discontinuation rates at 4 weeks and 3 months versus taper only, these benefits were not sustained at 6 months and beyond.​[[27]](#DarkerCDSweeneyBPBarryJMEtAl.Psycho-C7555C41)

### Monitoring

Even when a BZRA is properly tapered, withdrawal symptoms, usually mild and short-lived, may occur. See [Table 5](#BZRA_MonitoringTable) for monitoring parameters (every 1–2 weeks for the duration of the BZRA taper) and suggested management.

**Table 5:** Monitoring Parameters at Each Step (every 1–2 weeks) of BZRA Taper​[[18]](#PottieKThompsonWDaviesSEtAl.Depresc-C749CEC5)

| Monitoring Parameter | Method of Assessment | Suggested Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity and frequency of drug withdrawal symptoms such as: Anxiety Irritability Sweating Gastrointestinal symptoms Insomnia | Clinical assessment OR formal CIWA-Benzodiazepine scale, via scheduled telephone call or in-person appointment | Maintain current dose for 1–2 wk, then continue with a slower taper Counsel patients that withdrawal symptoms are usually mild and short term (up to a few weeks) |
| Mood, sleep quality and changes in sleep | Via scheduled telephone call or in-person appointment (see Insomnia ) | If insomnia persists: Maintain current dose for 1–2 wk, then continue with a slower taper Recommend sleep hygiene measures and/or CBT-I (see Insomnia and Other Resources ) |
| Potential benefits such as: Reduction in daytime sedation Improvement in cognition and alertness Reduction in number of falls | Via scheduled telephone call or in-person appointment | Encourage patients to note these benefits for positive reinforcement |

### Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Memantine

Many patients with Alzheimer disease will experience a positive impact on cognition from cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine.​[[28]](#TrinhNHHoblynJMohantySYaffeK.Effica-A75ABA86)​[[29]](#KnightRKhondokerMMagillNStewartRLan-A7637892) However, some patients will not benefit, and the long-term effectiveness of these medications is unclear. In addition, periodic reassessment of the value of ongoing therapy over the course of the disease is recommended due to the shifting nature of benefit-risk balance of ChEIs and memantine. In some cases, this group of medications may be initiated in patients to treat conditions and symptoms for which there is no evidence of benefit. Therefore, it is important to monitor the clinical impact of ChEIs and memantine on these patients to determine if the benefits outweigh the negative effects over the long term.​[[19]](#ReeveEFarrellBThompsonWEtAl.Evidenc-C74AD822)

Randomized trials have found that discontinuation of ChEIs and memantine after prolonged use was associated with deterioration of cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms, but did not affect quality of life. In summary, the decision to discontinue should be approached cautiously, on a case-by-case basis, and in conjunction with the patient, caregivers and family members.​[[19]](#ReeveEFarrellBThompsonWEtAl.Evidenc-C74AD822) Clinicians should also enquire about adverse effects that may have been unrecognized as related to the medications: bradycardia, decreased appetite, falls.

An algorithm (see [Figure 4](#CHEIsMemantineDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F3485E3)) in the guidelines can help clinicians determine how to deprescribe ChEIs and memantine.

### Selecting Patients

The deprescribing guideline suggests patients taking a ChEI or memantine for <12 months may continue to do so if they are able and willing. For those who are taking the medication for any of the approved indications outlined in Figure 3, discontinuation should be considered if the patient:

- Has been taking the medication for >12 months and there has been no benefit, a significant worsening of cognition and/or function over the past 6 months, or the patient has severe or end-stage major neurocognitive disorder
- Refuses or is unable to continue due to adverse drug events or contraindication (CI)
- Is experiencing non-adherence that cannot be resolved
- Is taking ChEI or memantine for a reason other than an evidence-based indication regardless of duration

### Approach

Recommendations include slowly reducing the dose of ChEIs and memantine to half the previous dose or stepping down through available dose formulations to the lowest available dose (see [Table 6](#CHEIsMemantine_TaperingTable)). Dose reductions should be made every 4 weeks. This will allow time to monitor the patient for reappearance of dementia-related symptoms that may require restarting the medication. Abrupt discontinuation is a reasonable option in some individuals, such as those experiencing an adverse drug reaction. For guidance on how to discuss deprescribing with patients and family/caregivers, see [Figure 4](#CHEIsMemantineDeprescribingAlgorithm-7F3485E3).

**Table 6:** Recommended Tapering Schedule for ChEIs and Memantine​[[19]](#ReeveEFarrellBThompsonWEtAl.Evidenc-C74AD822)

| Drug/Available Strength | Tapering Options | Time Until Next Dose Reduction | Five Half-Lives of the Medication​[a](duration of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Donepezil |  |  |  |
| 5 mg, 10 mg tablets | 10 mg once daily → 5 mg once daily → cease | 4 wk | 15 days (reversible inhibitor) |
| Galantamine |  |  |  |
| 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg extended-release capsules | 24 mg once daily → 16 mg once daily → 8 mg once daily → cease | 4 wk | 2 days​ [b] ​ [c] (reversible inhibitor) |
| Memantine |  |  |  |
| 10 mg, 20 mg tablets | 20 mg once daily (or 10 mg twice daily) → 10 mg once daily → cease | 4 wk | 21 days​ [b] ​ [c] |
| Rivastigmine |  |  |  |
| 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 4.5 mg, 6 mg capsules | 6 mg twice daily → 4.5 mg twice daily → 3 mg twice daily → 1.5 mg twice daily → 1.5 mg once daily → cease | 4 wk | 1 day​ [b] ​ [c] (6–9 h) |
| Transdermal patch: Patch 5 (contains rivastigmine 4.6 mg/24 h) , Patch 10 (contains 9.5 mg/24 h) , Patch 15 (contains 13.3 mg/24 h) | 13.3 mg/24 h → 9.5 mg/24 h → 4.6 mg/24 h → cease | 4 wk | 17 days​ [b] ​ [c] (6–9 h) |

[a] Time after which over 96% of the medication is expected to be cleared from the system, rounded up to the nearest whole day.

[b] Product information reports that clearance of drug or metabolites may be reduced in people with renal impairment.

[c] Product information reports that clearance of drug or metabolites may be reduced in people with hepatic impairment.

### Monitoring

Monitoring should take place at each dose-reduction step to determine suitability for further tapering. The patient, their family and caregivers should be advised to monitor for specific symptoms; what to do if symptoms return (see [Table 7](#SymptomManagement_CHEIsMemantineDiscontinuationTable)); and to contact the health-care provider regarding any symptoms that occur following discontinuation.

Both cognitive and functional abilities and neuropsychiatric symptoms should be monitored over the 4-week period. In addition, standardized cognitive and functional tests may be beneficial, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus) and Global Assessment Scale [GAS].

**Table 7:** Guidance on Management of Change in Condition Following Discontinuation of ChEIs and Memantine​[[19]](#ReeveEFarrellBThompsonWEtAl.Evidenc-C74AD822)

| Timing of Symptoms after Dose Reduction/Cessation | Types of Symptoms | Action to be Taken by Family/Caregivers | Possible Cause |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <1 wk | Severe symptoms, including agitation, aggression, hallucinations, reduced consciousness | Restart previous dose immediately, contact responsible health-care professional as soon as possible | Adverse drug withdrawal event |
| 2–6 wk | Worsening of cognition, behavioural or psychological symptoms or function | Consider restarting previous dose, contact responsible health-care professional at next available time to make an appointment | Re-emergence of symptoms that were being treated by ChEI/memantine |
| 6 wk–3 months | Worsening of cognition, behavioural or psychological symptoms or function | Contact responsible health-care professional at next available time to make an appointment | Likely progression of condition or possible re-emergence of symptoms that were being treated by ChEI/memantine |
| >3 months | Any | Per usual care | Progression of condition |

### Proton Pump Inhibitors

Most indications for PPIs are for short-term use, e.g., 4–8 weeks (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Although generally considered safe, PPIs taken beyond the recommended period can increase risk of side effects and drug interactions, contribute to pill burden, and have a significant economic impact. Side effects associated with PPIs include diarrhea, impaired vitamin B12 absorption, hypomagnesemia, Clostridioides difficile infection, hip fractures and pneumonia.​[[30]](#HaastrupP.F.ThompsonW.SondergaardJ.-A6546141) About half of all patients on long-term PPI therapy do not have an evidence-based indication.​[[31]](#McDonaldEGMilliganJFrenetteCEtAl.Co-A8314BB1)

Elderly patients are potentially more susceptible to these effects. Due to the increased risk of C. difficile infection, bone loss and fracture; the 2019 update of the Beers Criteria considers it inappropriate to use PPIs beyond 8 weeks without justification.​[[13]](#AmericanGeriatricsSocietyBeersCrite-C74BC271)

Attempting to stop or reduce PPIs at least once per year in most patients is the number 1 recommendation of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology in a [Choosing Wisely Canada](https://choosingwiselycanada.org/gastroenterology/) campaign that seeks to advance a national dialogue on avoiding unnecessary tests and treatments in health care.

The guideline includes an algorithm to help clinicians seeking assistance in deprescribing PPIs (see [Figure 5](#fig_id)).

### Selecting Patients

It is crucial to determine the original indication of the PPI when selecting patients who may benefit from deprescribing. The PPI deprescribing guideline does not apply to patients with Barrett esophagus, severe esophagitis (grade C or D on endoscopy), a documented history of GI bleeding or chronic NSAID use with bleeding risk (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease, Prevention of PUD during ASA or NSAID Therapy).

A patient information [pamphlet](https://deprescribing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Deprescribing-Pamphlet_PPI_ENG_CFP.pdf) and an [infographic](https://deprescribing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Deprescribing-focus-on-PPIs-FINAL-Mar-7-2018.pdf), available from deprescribing.org, can facilitate the shared decision-making process between the patient and health-care provider.

### Approach

Several deprescribing approaches are defined and their level of evidence and strength of recommendation are presented in [Table 8](#PPIsApproachesTable). Discontinuation without tapering is a reasonable option for patients who have completed a short-term treatment for a known indication, such as peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori eradication, prophylaxis for intensive care unit stress ulcers and upper GI symptoms without endoscopy (asymptomatic for 3 consecutive days).​[[20]](#FarrellBPottieKThompsonWEtAl.Depres-C7491B4F)

**Table 8:** Approaches to Deprescribing PPIs​​[[a]](#afn29625)

| Approach | Definition | Evidence​[b]/Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abrupt discontinuation | Stopping the PPI without dose reduction or on-demand use | Increases risk of symptom relapse (very low-quality evidence) Other strategies are preferred |
| Tapering regimen | Gradual dose reduction of the PPI (e.g., from twice daily to daily, from daily to every other day, from high dose to low dose) | No significantly greater relapse than with standard-dose PPIs (low-quality evidence) Strong recommendation |
| On-demand dosing | Daily intake of the PPI for a period sufficient to achieve resolution of reflux-related symptoms; following symptom resolution, the medication is discontinued until symptoms reoccur, at which point, medication is taken daily again until the symptoms resolve​ [32] | Increases risk of symptom relapse (low-quality evidence), lowers pill burden by 3.5 fewer pills/wk (moderate-quality evidence) Strong recommendation |
| Step down to histamine H 2 –receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) | Abrupt discontinuation or tapering of PPI followed by an H 2 RA at any approved dose or dosing interval | Increases risk of symptom relapse (moderate-quality evidence) Weak recommendation |

[a] For symptom-free patients with mild to moderate esophagitis or GERD treated with a PPI for ≥4 weeks.

[b] Compared with continuous PPI.

For symptom-free patients with mild to moderate esophagitis or GERD treated with a PPI for ≥4 weeks, both the tapering regimen and on-demand approach are considered equal and strongly recommended in the guideline. Since there is no evidence that one approach is better than the other, patient preference should guide the clinician’s approach to deprescribing the PPI.

In all cases, a key element is education and encouragement of the patient to implement nonpharmacological interventions, such as avoiding meals 2–3 hours before bedtime, elevating the head of the bed, addressing any need for weight loss and avoiding dietary triggers (see Dyspepsia and GERD).​[[20]](#FarrellBPottieKThompsonWEtAl.Depres-C7491B4F)

Tapering options and administration advice for each PPI are presented in [Table 9](#PPIsTaperingTable).

[a] On-demand dosing: daily intake of a PPI for a period sufficient to achieve resolution of reflux-related symptoms; following symptom resolution, the medication is discontinued until symptoms reoccur, at which point medication is taken again daily until the symptoms resolve.​[[32]](#Armstrongxa0Dxa0Marshallxa0JKxa0Chi-C74CAA07)

### Monitoring

Typically, follow-up to identify any symptom reoccurrence should occur after 4 and 12 weeks of deprescribing. Parameters to monitor include heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric pain, dyspepsia or pain on swallowing.​[[20]](#FarrellBPottieKThompsonWEtAl.Depres-C7491B4F) It is important to monitor the severity of these symptoms and whether they interfere with the patient’s daily activities or sleep. Whether patients present symptoms due to rebound acid hypersecretion or from an underlying disorder such as GERD, they should be managed similarly with nonpharmacologic interventions, on-demand PPI use, step-down therapy to an H2RA or antacids (see Histamine H2-receptor Antagonists (H2RAs) (CPhA Monograph) and Dyspepsia and GERD).​[[20]](#FarrellBPottieKThompsonWEtAl.Depres-C7491B4F)
