CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful in addressing patient needs, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

### Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is abdominal and pelvic pain associated with menses. More than half of menstruating Canadians are affected to some degree and 15% are incapacitated for 1–3 days per month.​[[1]](#c0074n00003)​[[2]](#refitem-117212-61F7BA9E) Peak onset of primary dysmenorrhea occurs between late teens and early 20s with prevalence decreasing progressively with age. Risk factors include menarche <12 years of age, increased duration and amount of menstrual flow, smoking or passive smoke exposure, low BMI, family history of dysmenorrhea, and nulliparity.​[[4]](#refitem-117212-61D9A023) Other risk factors include mood disorders, prior sexual abuse and poor social support.​[[3]](#c0074n00014) Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of organic pathology, while secondary dysmenorrhea results from an underlying cause such as endometriosis, adenomyosis or obstructed uterine outflow (see [Table 1](#c0074n00001)).

### Goals of Therapy

- Decrease or abolish distressing menstrual pain
- Target and treat the specific underlying causes of secondary dysmenorrhea

### Investigations

- A thorough history to determine the severity, timing, duration and manifestations of the pain as well as the aggravating and relieving factors. As a general rule, the pain of primary dysmenorrhea starts within several hours before the onset of bleeding up to a few hours after the start of menses​[[1]](#c0074n00003) and:

  - lasts a maximum of 3 days
  - is described as crampy, located in the lower mid-abdomen and/or pelvis
  - may be accompanied by other symptoms of prostaglandin excess such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, backache, thigh pain, headache, dizziness
- Physical examination of the abdomen and pelvis is important to identify potential causes of secondary dysmenorrhea. In patients who have never been sexually active, an abdominal examination and inspection of the external genitalia are sufficient. In sexually active patients, a single digit vaginal examination can be a useful addition to the exam. Each pelvic structure should be carefully palpated in order to isolate potential areas of tenderness, masses or nodules. Suspect secondary dysmenorrhea in patients >30 years of age with no prior history of dysmenorrhea and in all patients refractory to first-line medical therapy.
- In the absence of abnormal findings, diagnostic imaging is unlikely to be helpful and may be misleading if noncontributory abnormalities are discovered. However, further investigation with imaging (pelvic ultrasound or MRI) is indicated if:
  - physical examination is suggestive of a secondary cause of dysmenorrhea such as a pelvic mass or uterine outflow obstruction
  - patients are refractory to first-line agents
  - physical examination is not possible, e.g., in patients with significant obesity or if the patient refuses
- Laparoscopic examination for endometriosis is reserved for patients with refractory dysmenorrhea (see Endometriosis).
- No laboratory tests are required or helpful in diagnosis.

**Table 1:** Characteristics of Dysmenorrhea​[[1]](#c0074n00003)[[2]](#refitem-117212-61F7BA9E)[[3]](#c0074n00014)

| Primary | Secondary |
| --- | --- |
| No identifiable pelvic pathology Occurs in ovulatory cycles Most severe in young, nulliparous patients Onset within 2 y after menarche; tendency to improve with age More common in people who smoke Pain due to myometrial contractions induced by prostaglandin production in the secretory endometrium Pain is relieved or ameliorated by empiric therapy with NSAIDs and/or ovulation suppression | Associated with pelvic pathology, e.g., endometriosis, adenomyosis, submucous uterine myoma, endometrial polyp, intrauterine device, pelvic inflammatory disease, vaginal septum, imperforate hymen, congenital Mullerian malformations, post-endometrial ablation syndrome Age of onset is variable Diagnostic clues include pain onset premenstrually, pain lasting throughout the menses, infertility, dyspareunia, abnormal uterine bleeding Partial symptomatic improvement may be noted with NSAIDs |

### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of dysmenorrhea is shown in [Figure 1](#c0074n00002). It is important to explain that primary dysmenorrhea is a common phenomenon. It is frequently distressing and may be debilitating. Therefore, it is important to validate the patient’s concerns and offer symptomatic treatment. Reassure the patient that pain does not indicate an organic process or abnormality in most cases. If an organic cause is suspected, further investigation and targeted therapy are indicated.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Topical heat therapy, e.g., heating pads​[[3]](#c0074n00014)​[[5]](#refitem-117214-605100CB)
- Regular exercise may provide pain relief.​[[6]](#c0074n00104) Both low-intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching) and high-intensity (e.g., Zumba, aerobic training) exercise for 45–60 minutes 3 times per week have shown benefit;​[[6]](#c0074n00104) in most studies, exercise was carried out throughout the month (i.e., including the duration of menses)​[[6]](#c0074n00104)
- High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has shown promise in the management of dysmenorrhea​[[5]](#refitem-117214-605100CB)​[[7]](#c0074n00072)
- Facilitate smoking cessation, as smoking is an independent risk factor for dysmenorrhea​[[3]](#c0074n00014)​[[8]](#refitem-1172113-60522AEA)
- Surgical management may be indicated to treat dysmenorrhea refractory to medical management, e.g., laparoscopy, pelvic denervation procedures (laparoscopic uterosacral ligament resection, presacral neurectomy), hysterectomy
- There is insufficient evidence to recommend behavioural interventions, e.g., progressive relaxation, or the application of acupoint stimulation (acupressure or acupuncture) for the management of dysmenorrhea​[[9]](#refitem-1172114-6057B57B)​[[10]](#refitem-1172115-6057F519)

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

NSAIDs commonly used for the management of dysmenorrhea are presented in [Table 2](#c0074n00066).

Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by abnormal uterine contractions as a result of increased prostaglandin production by the endometrium in ovulatory cycles. NSAIDs, which are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, are the treatment of choice. All NSAIDs except ASA have been shown to be effective in about 80% of cases of dysmenorrhea.​[[11]](#c0074n00015)​[[12]](#c0074n00067) In practice, there appears to be minimal difference among NSAIDs.​[[11]](#c0074n00015) With short-term use, side effects of all NSAIDs are generally minor. Ibuprofen and naproxen **sodium** are available without a prescription. The choice depends more on tolerability, duration of action, cost and availability.​[[3]](#c0074n00014)​[[11]](#c0074n00015) NSAIDs should be taken with food, starting immediately at the onset of symptoms or menses and continued on a *regular schedule* for 2–3 days. An initial loading dose may help obtain faster relief of symptoms.​[[3]](#c0074n00014) NSAIDs may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, e.g., MI or stroke.​[[13]](#c0074n00242)​[[14]](#c0074n00243) However, it should be noted that cardiovascular events are likely to be extremely rare in young patients using NSAIDs on an intermittent basis.

Acetaminophen demonstrates minimal analgesic effect in dysmenorrhea and inferior pain relief compared with NSAIDs.​[[11]](#c0074n00015)​[[12]](#c0074n00067) Consider acetaminophen only for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs.

### Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

For a listing and prescribing information on hormonal contraceptives, see Contraception.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are available as oral, vaginal or transdermal formulations. CHCs inhibit ovulation, which limits endometrial growth and decreases menstrual blood flow, thereby suppressing prostaglandin production at menses. CHCs are ideal first-line choices for patients wishing contraception.​[[15]](#refitem-1142120-1B4E39B2) COCs can effectively treat primary dysmenorrhea with both the medium- and low-dose estrogen formulas, i.e., ≤35 mcg ethinyl estradiol.​[[3]](#c0074n00014)​[[16]](#c0074n00105)​[[17]](#refitem-1142121-1A6430BD)​[[18]](#refitem-1172120-62F51187) The **contraceptive patch** or **vaginal ring** are also useful for relieving dysmenorrhea as COC.​[[19]](#refitem-1142120-1B4BFE2F) Continuous or extended-cycle regimens decrease the frequency of menstrual periods and the prevalence of pain and are generally preferable to cyclic regimens.​[[20]](#refitem-1172122-62F5BB89)​[[21]](#refitem-1142130-1A64CDC3) These regimens also ameliorate dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis and adenomyosis.

For prescribing information on contraceptives, see Contraception.

### Progestin-Only Contraceptives

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system **(LNG-IUS)** releases a low dose of progestin inside the uterine cavity. While ovulation is not suppressed in all patients, the endometrium becomes atrophic and inactive, and menstrual blood loss is significantly reduced.​[[3]](#c0074n00014) These effects can benefit patients with dysmenorrhea. LNG-IUS is recommended for treatment of dysmenorrhea associated with heavy bleeding​[[22]](#refitem-1142118-AAA380BC)​[[23]](#refitem-1142119-AAA3A6E7) and there is good-quality evidence that patients with dysmenorrhea and adenomyosis​[[22]](#refitem-1142118-AAA380BC)​[[24]](#refitem-1142120-AAA3EE15)​[[25]](#refitem-1142121-AAA43719)​[[26]](#refitem-1142122-AAA46EB9) or endometriosis​[[27]](#refitem-1142124-AAA4B8EC)​[[28]](#refitem-1142123-AAA4B6A4) will respond to LNG-IUS. Although the evidence is limited, LNG-IUS may also be considered for symptomatic management of dysmenorrhea irrespective of cause or associated symptoms.​[[22]](#refitem-1142118-AAA380BC)​[[24]](#refitem-1142120-AAA3EE15)​[[29]](#c0074n00234)

**Depot** medroxyprogesterone **(DMPA)** intramuscular injections suppress ovulation, induce endometrial atrophy and produce amenorrhea. Consider DMPA as a treatment option in the management of primary dysmenorrhea in patients who cannot tolerate estrogen and in those over 35 years of age who smoke.​[[26]](#refitem-1142122-AAA46EB9) DMPA can also be useful in treating secondary dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis, adenomyosis or structural abnormalities of the uterus. However, the return to fertility may be delayed after it is stopped; for patients wishing to become pregnant soon after discontinuation, other methods may be more appropriate. Although bone mineral density may return to baseline on discontinuation of therapy, use DMPA with caution in adolescents 12–18 years of age, as they have not yet attained their peak bone mass. To promote overall bone health, encourage adequate calcium (total of 1200 mg elemental Ca​2+ daily from all sources, preferably through dietary intake) and vitamin D (1000 units supplement daily) in patients on DMPA therapy.​[[30]](#c0074n00122)

The single rod etonogestrel (ENG) implant has become available in Canada in 2020. Like other progestin-only long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), the implant works by continuously (over a period of 3 years) releasing a low-dose of progestin (etonogestrel), therefore inhibiting ovulation. Since its use is associated with a decrease in bleeding days per month, it may be a suitable option in the management of dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis-associated pain.

### Natural Health Products

Numerous medicinal herbs and vitamins have been proposed for the management of dysmenorrhea, but high-quality studies are lacking.​[[3]](#c0074n00014) Some supplements, including fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, zinc sulphate, ﬁsh oil, fish oil plus vitamin B1, and vitamin B1 alone, may potentially provide benefit based on low-quality evidence.​[[31]](#refitem-1172134-61EF64D7) Ginger at a dose of 750–2000 mg daily for 3 to 4 days at the start of a menstrual cycle may be comparable to NSAID treatment for pain and holds promise but high-quality trials are recommended.​[[32]](#refitem-1172114-61E47E88)

### Therapeutic Tips

- A therapeutic trial of 3–6 months with either an NSAID (regularly scheduled starting before anticipated onset of menstruation and continued for 2–3 days) or a CHC is usually sufficient to demonstrate effectiveness. Although there are no clinical trials to support the combination, if either fails, it is reasonable to consider a trial of NSAID and CHC before commencing further investigation. CHC administered in a continuous or extended cycle is generally preferable to cyclic CHC.​[[21]](#refitem-1142130-1A64CDC3)
- Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., CHCs, LNG-IUS, ENG implant, DMPA) can be an effective treatment for conditions that cause dysmenorrhea (e.g., endometriosis, adenomyosis). Therefore, consider starting patients on hormonal contraceptives while waiting for the results of investigations, even if suspecting secondary dysmenorrhea.
- Pharmacotherapy fails in 20% of patients. These patients often have secondary dysmenorrhea and require further investigation. Ultrasound, MRI and diagnostic laparoscopy are useful to differentiate primary from secondary dysmenorrhea. Therapy can then be directed to the underlying cause and may involve surgery, e.g., laser ablation or electrofulguration of endometriosis. Dysmenorrhea resulting from heavy menstrual bleeding will improve if it is controlled.​[[33]](#c0074n00107)
- In a small percentage of patients, pharmacotherapy and/or conservative surgery fail to relieve menstrual pain. These patients may require surgical intervention such as hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy to obtain relief.
- Complex chronic pain may have neuropathic elements that perpetuate symptoms. Patients with poorly controlled dysmenorrhea and overlapping chronic pain conditions (e.g., chronic pelvic pain) may benefit from the addition of a neuromodulator such as amitriptyline or gabapentin.​[[34]](#Sachedina2020)
