### Lice (Pediculosis)

### Pathophysiology

Lice are tiny, blood-sucking insects that are specific parasites of humans. Outbreaks in institutions such as schools and long-term care facilities are common, with an estimated prevalence of head lice of 1–3% in elementary school-aged children.​[[1]](#HarrisJCrawshawJGMillershipS.Incide-DA7A7844)​[[2]](#NoAuthorsListed.HeadLiceInfestation-29A30190)

Three species of lice exist: head lice (*Pediculus humanus capitis*), pubic lice (*Phthirus pubis* or “crabs”) and body lice (*Pediculus humanus corporis*). Lice are obligate human parasites; survival time off the human host varies. See [Table 1](#psc1171n00009) for information on the characteristics of the 3 types of lice and infestations involving them.

### Goals of Therapy

- Exterminate head, body or pubic lice
- Relieve pruritus
- Prevent secondary bacterial infections
- Prevent spread of the infestation
- Prevent reinfestation

### Patient Assessment

Patients with recurrent or unresponsive head lice or pubic lice require further assessment and/or treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner. Characteristics of the 3 types of lice are compared in [Table 1](#psc1171n00009).

**Table 1:** Characteristics and Assessment of Lice​[[3]](#psc1171n1001)[[4]](#psc1171n1002)[[5]](#psc1171n1004)[[6]](#FeldmeierH.TreatmentOfPediculosisCa-DA7AE17D)[[7]](#CummingsCFinlayJCMacDonaldNE.HeadLi-8D23D839)[[8]](#psc1171n1006)[[9]](#psc1171n1007)[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)[[11]](#HarvardHealthPublishingHarvardMedic-997AF3A3)[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)[[13]](#HealthLinkBC.PubicLice.AvailableFro-997B539D)

| Characteristic | Head Lice(Pediculus humanus capitis) | Pubic Lice(Phthirus pubis) | Body Lice(Pediculus humanus corporis) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Appearance​ [a] | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovals, often confused with dandruff Louse: up to 4 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs ending in small claws, grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovals, often confused with skin flakes Louse: up to 2 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs (the 2 pairs of legs closest to the rear have large crab-like claws), grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovals Louse: up to 3 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs ending in claws, grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings |
| Life cycle​ [a] | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatch Louse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 7–15 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days on the scalp, with females laying 5–10 eggs per day. Infestation usually involves <10 live lice | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatch Louse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 10–17 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days on the affected body area, with females laying approximately 3 eggs per day. Infestation of the pubic hair usually involves an average of 12 live lice | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatch Louse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 9–12 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days in the clothing if it is being continually worn by the host. Female lice lay up to 8 eggs per day. Infested patients typically have <10 active lice on the skin at any one time but clothing may contain hundreds |
| Survival time away from host​ [a] | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to survive Louse: 1–2 days | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to survive Louse: 1–2 days | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to survive Louse: 1–2 days |
| Lesions/symptoms | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules around ears, face and neck; pruritic scalp Secondary: excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections; enlarged cervical and nuchal lymph nodes | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules, pruritus in the anogenital area. Possibly small brown specks on undergarments due to lice excreta Secondary: excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections. In heavy infestations, bite sites may reveal a blue-grey skin discoloration which may not be as noticeable on darker skin | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules, pruritus (worse at night), particularly around neck, waist and axillae Secondary: linear excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections. In extended, heavy infestations, there may be a blue-grey darkening (possibly not as noticeable on darker skin) and thickening of the skin, fatigue, anemia |
| Location of lice/nits | Scalp hair, particularly in the warmer parts of the head (behind ears and at nape of neck). Nits are laid at base of hair shaft; therefore, viable eggs usually located within 6 mm of scalp | Pubic hair (uncommonly other areas with coarse hair such as eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, chest hair, axillae). Nits are laid at base of hair shaft | Along the seams of clothing worn close to the body where it is warmer. Occasionally a live louse may be seen clinging to body hair |
| Transmission | Head-to-head contact Uncommonly, by items that come into contact with an infested person, e.g., hats, scarves, combs, hair accessories, furniture, carpet Not transmitted between humans and animals | Sexual exposure (most common); close physical contact; sharing clothing, bedding or towels with an infected person Not transmitted between humans and animals | Clothing or bedding; conditions of poor hygiene. Unlikely to be transmitted if clothing or bedding laundered at least once per wk Unlike head and pubic lice, body lice are vectors of human diseases such as typhus, relapsing fever, trench fever and endocarditis Not transmitted between humans and animals |
| Host | Primarily children Highest incidence in ages 3–11 y Much less common among people of African-Americans descent, possibly due to the claws of the louse being less adept at grasping the shaft of tightly coiled hair types | Primarily sexually active individuals | Primarly persons with poor hygiene (unable to launder clothes and bedding at least once per wk) |
| Differential diagnosis | Dandruff Hair casts (thin, elongated, cylinder-shaped segments of dandruff that encircle the hair shaft and are easily dislodged) Seborrheic dermatitis Accumulation of hair cosmetics | Seborrheic dermatitis Folliculitis Dermatophytosis (e.g., tinea cruris) Arthropod bites Scabies | Seborrheic dermatitis Flea bites or other insect bites Atopic dermatitis/contact dermatitis Impetigo Folliculitis Renal or hepatic impairment causing pruritus Drug reaction |

[a] Details regarding appearance, life cycle and survival time away from host vary slightly from one expert source to another; information provided is an approximate average or range as a guideline only.

### Diagnosis

Head lice: Diagnosis requires detection of live lice on the scalp, which can be difficult since lice crawl quickly (especially on dry hair) and avoid light. Detection methods are discussed below.

- Combing the scalp with a lice comb was 4 times more effective at detecting head lice than direct visual inspection in one study.​[[14]](#MumcuogluKYFrigerMIoffe-UspenskyIEt-8D211D7C)
- Another study showed that “wet combing with conditioner” is a reliable method of detecting head lice.​[[15]](#psc1171n1008)​[[16]](#DevoreCDSchutzeGECouncilOnSchoolHea-DA7B491F) The wet combing method requires that white coloured hair conditioner be maximally applied to all of the hair, then the hair combed first from the base to the end with a regular comb, then with a nit comb. The material in the nit comb should be checked for live lice, which should be crushed and discarded in tissue if detected; the combing procedure should be repeated 5 times for each area of hair.​[[17]](#psc1171n1009)
- Detection of nits alone cannot be relied upon to accurately identify an active infestation of head lice. While viable nits are generally found on the hair shaft within 0.6 cm of the scalp, studies have not confirmed that this is a reliable predictor of an active infestation. Live lice must be identified to confirm the diagnosis.​[[7]](#CummingsCFinlayJCMacDonaldNE.HeadLi-8D23D839)

Pubic lice: Diagnosis is made when live lice are detected in the hair of the affected area. Pubic lice is considered a sexually transmitted infection; further assessment for the presence of other sexually transmitted infections is recommended in patients diagnosed with pubic lice.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)

Body lice: Diagnosis is made when live lice are detected in the seams of clothing.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

- **Identify and examine potential human contacts** to assess them for treatment and to prevent a cycle of reinfection. Potential contacts for all 3 types of lice include those with whom the person had close physical contact (especially hair-to-hair contact for head lice or sexual contact for pubic lice) or shared personal items such as clothing, hats, scarves, bedding, towels, combs, brushes, headphones, helmets or stuffed animals within the last month. Pets do not transmit any type of human lice and should not be treated.
- **Treat personal items or room/home**. Indirect spread of all 3 types of lice through contact with personal belongings or furniture may occur rarely, given the short time that lice and nits can survive away from humans (see [Table 1](#psc1171n00009)). Laundering items in the hot water cycle (at least 50°C/122°F) of a residential washing machine and using the hottest setting of the clothes dryer should kill lice and nits. Items that cannot be laundered can be put in a clothes dryer at the hottest setting for at least 20 minutes, dry cleaned or stored in a sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks. Combs and brushes can be soaked in hot water (at least 50°C/122°F) for 10 minutes. Furniture, mattresses and flooring can be vacuumed thoroughly, particularly the areas where the person sat or lay.​[[7]](#CummingsCFinlayJCMacDonaldNE.HeadLi-8D23D839)​[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)​[[16]](#DevoreCDSchutzeGECouncilOnSchoolHea-DA7B491F)​[[18]](#IzriAChosidowO.EfficacyOfMachineLau-DA7B79A7)
- **Mechanically remove head lice**. Primary treatment of head lice via a combing method known as “bug busting” requires combing of wet hair for 30 minutes every third or fourth day for 2 weeks using a fine-tooth comb to find and remove lice over the entire life cycle. This method is considered unfeasible on a widespread basis but may be an option for motivated caregivers of children with short hair that is not curly. Trials comparing wet combing with placebo, permethrin or malathion as a primary treatment for head lice have yielded conflicting results, possibly because of varying insecticide resistance.​[[9]](#psc1171n1007)​[[19]](#psc1171n1010)​[[20]](#psc1171n1011)​[[21]](#BurgessIF.HeadLice.BMJClinEvid.2011-DA7C3EC4)
- Nit removal with a fine-tooth comb should be performed after any pharmacological treatment due to most products not being reliably ovicidal and increasing resistance rates to topical products. See [Pharmacologic Therapy](#psc1171n00011) for information on products used to aid in nit removal.
- Hot air (e.g., LouseBuster) devices attempt to kill lice and nits by dessication with exposure to high-volume hot air. One trial found a 30-minute application of hot air resulted in nearly 100% mortality of eggs and 80% mortality of hatched lice. However, since only 11 children treated with this method had follow-up and subjects with a high probability of reinfestation were excluded, valid conclusions on clinical effectiveness cannot be made. The machine is expensive and requires special training to use.​[[22]](#psc1171n01068)​[[23]](#psc1171n01069) A regular blow dryer should be avoided as it can cause live lice to be airborne and spread to others nearby.​[[24]](#FrankowskiBLBocchiniJACouncilOnScho-DE17CB49)
- Electric combs (e.g., LiceGuard, Robicomb) that claim to zap and kill lice have no unbiased evidence of effectiveness. They do not kill nits and must be used on dry hair. Since lice move easily on dry hair, they may avoid the teeth of the comb, and any scalp debris that is caught in the comb will cut off the current until the comb is cleaned.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Keep safety considerations and ease of administration in mind when choosing a pediculicide. See [Table 5](#d2e1366) for more information.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Pediculicides.

### Head Lice

Family members and close contacts of individuals with head lice should be examined and treated at the same time if infested. Treatment should be repeated in 7 days. Some sources suggest bedmates should be treated prophylactically.​[[16]](#DevoreCDSchutzeGECouncilOnSchoolHea-DA7B491F)​[[35]](#psc1171n1015) See also [Figure 1](#ManagementOfHeadLice-CA658FBD).

- The neurotoxic insecticides permethrin and **pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide** and the physically acting agents **isopropyl myristate/cyclomethicone** and **dimeticones (dimethicones)** have demonstrated efficacy and lack of toxicity in the treatment of head lice. None of these agents are considered to be reliably 100% ovicidal; retreatment is recommended.​[[19]](#psc1171n1010)​[[21]](#BurgessIF.HeadLice.BMJClinEvid.2011-DA7C3EC4) [Table 5](#d2e1366) provides information on the mechanism of action, precautions, directions for use, efficacy, safety and adverse effects of these 4 treatments for head lice. Although not officially indicated for lice treatment in pregnancy, permethrin 1% is the drug of choice for all species of lice during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​[[36]](#BriggsBOOK11thEditionDrugsInPregnan-29AF096F)​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)​[[38]](#psc1171n00032) Benzyl alcohol **5%** lotion is also an effective physically acting agent against live lice but is not ovicidal.​[[16]](#DevoreCDSchutzeGECouncilOnSchoolHea-DA7B491F) It is approved for use in Canada but is not yet marketed. Lindane is also an effective neurotoxic pediculicide; however, there are concerns about possible serious adverse effects​[[39]](#NolanKKamrathJLevittJ.LindaneToxici-DA7DA103)​[[40]](#LoomisDEtAl.CarcinogenicityOfLindan-DA7DA7EC) and it is no longer available in Canada.
- After treatment, nits will remain attached to the hair. Given increasing resistance to topical products, nits should be mechanically removed with a fine-tooth comb after any pharmacologic treatment to minimize the chances of self-reinfestation. The female louse secretes a cement-like fixative to hold her eggs in place on the hair strand. This fixative material works as a simple holdfast and not a chemical adhesive. To loosen louse nits, lubricants such as hair conditioners can assist in sliding the eggshells along the hair shaft. Commercial nit removal products have no proven efficacy.​[[41]](#BurgessIF.DoNitRemovalFormulationsA-DA838C27)​[[42]](#LapeereHBrochezLVerhaegheEVander-St-DA839332) Several other methods of removing nits have been suggested. Although the clinical benefit has not been documented,​[[43]](#psc1171n1018) some sources suggest that the glue by which nits are attached can be loosened by soaking the hair with **white vinegar** (3–5% **acetic acid**), wrapping the hair in a towel (soaked in the vinegar) for 30–60 minutes and rinsing with water afterwards, making removal of the nits with a metal fine-tooth comb easier.
- Suffocation-based treatments with occlusive agents, such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline), Cetaphil cleanser (also known as Nuvo lotion/method), mayonnaise and hair styling gels, may only partially impede lice ventilation. Instead of lungs, lice have air channels throughout their body such as in the prothorax and abdomen areas, allowing the diffusion of oxygen. These air channels can be closed by structures called spiracles and any occlusive agent would need to block 100% of the spiracles for asphyxiation to occur. The musculature of these spiracles responds much like a human cough to clear the airways and therefore smothering lice is difficult.​[[44]](#psc1171n1025)​[[45]](#psc1171n1026) Evidence for these types of products is limited: an uncontrolled study found Cetaphil cleanser to be effective,​[[46]](#PearlmanDL.ASimpleTreatmentForHeadL-8E2DD300) and another study that assessed vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, melted butter, and petroleum jelly found only petroleum jelly to cause significant louse mortality; none of the products prevented the lice from laying eggs.​[[47]](#psc1171n1028)

The “no-nit” policy requiring children be free of nits before returning to school has not been effective in mitigating outbreaks. Consequently, it is recommended that parents of an affected child be notified, and that the child not be sent home early, but instead receive treatment with an effective pediculicide that evening and return to school the next morning.​[[7]](#CummingsCFinlayJCMacDonaldNE.HeadLi-8D23D839)​[[16]](#DevoreCDSchutzeGECouncilOnSchoolHea-DA7B491F)​[[35]](#psc1171n1015)

### Head Lice Treatment Failures

Treatment failure can occur due to misdiagnosis, improper use of pediculicide (e.g., hair not saturated from scalp to ends or product not left on hair long enough), not repeating the treatment after 7–10 days, reapplication too soon after initial application, inadequate manual removal of nits, repeated exposure to lice (reinfestation) or resistance to a pediculicide.

Resistance to the neurotoxic agents pyrethrins and permethrin has developed in countries with heavy pediculicide usage such as France, Czech Republic, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.​[[48]](#psc1171n1019) Formal collection of resistance patterns has not been done in Canada, so the prevalence of resistance is unknown. In countries with documented resistance, the appropriate choice has been dependent on local resistance patterns, which continue to change.​[[49]](#psc1171n1020)​[[50]](#psc1171n1021)​[[51]](#DurandRBouvresseSBerdjaneZEtAl.Inse-DCA94D5D)

When a properly applied treatment fails, try switching to a product of a different pharmacologic class.​[[4]](#psc1171n1002) If switching to a different pharmacologic class is not effective, the following alternative therapies have been investigated for difficult cases unresponsive to the usual agents, generally based on limited evidence:

- Permethrin **5%** cream (officially indicated only for scabies treatment) left on overnight under a plastic shower cap: wash hair with shampoo that does not contain conditioner and dry completely before applying the treatment.​[[52]](#MazurekCMLeeNP.HowToManageHeadLice.-29AAFFE8)​[[53]](#psc1171n1022) Permethrin 5% use is considered compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding.​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)​[[38]](#psc1171n00032)​[[54]](#psc1171n00031)
- Oral ivermectin 200 mcg/kg repeated in 7–10 days.​[[55]](#psc1171n1023) Ivermectin is not recommended in children weighing <15 kg since safety is unknown.​[[6]](#FeldmeierH.TreatmentOfPediculosisCa-DA7AE17D)​[[56]](#PanahiYPoursalehZGoldustM.TheEffica-DE11D349) However, one observational study in infants and children <15 kg showed only mild adverse effects in approximately 4% of patients.​[[57]](#LevyMMartinLBursztejnACEtAl.Ivermec-95D6E6A5) No specific recommendations are made for the use of ivermectin in the treatment of lice during pregnancy; however, no teratogenic or fetotoxic effects have been documented in human pregnancy and it is felt to pose a low risk to the fetus.​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)​[[36]](#BriggsBOOK11thEditionDrugsInPregnan-29AF096F) Limited data indicate that ivermectin is poorly excreted into breast milk.​[[58]](#LactMedAvailableFromHttpswww.ncbi.n-29AF6E6B) The CDC considers ivermectin to be probably compatible with breastfeeding.​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)

  Topical ivermectin 0.5% is effective for treatment of head lice,​[[59]](#PariserDMMeinkingTLBellMEtAl.Topica-8D29429F) but is not available in Canada. Topical ivermectin 1% is available in Canada for the treatment of rosacea but it has not been studied in the treatment of lice or scabies.
- A combination of oral sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim (10 mg/kg/day of trimethoprim usually twice daily for 10 days) plus **permethrin 1%** applied for 10 minutes on day 1 and day 7 may be effective for cases resistant to all topical pediculicides, according to one study.​[[60]](#psc1171n1024) Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.​[[36]](#BriggsBOOK11thEditionDrugsInPregnan-29AF096F) It is considered safe to use while breastfeeding healthy full-term babies but should be avoided in G6PD-deficient infants.​[[58]](#LactMedAvailableFromHttpswww.ncbi.n-29AF6E6B)

Itching does not necessarily mean that a reinfestation has occurred. Itching can be caused by an inflammatory response to the pediculicide and may persist for several days after treatment. An **oral antihistamine** or low-potency **topical corticosteroid** may be required for relief.

### Pubic Lice

The pediculicides used to treat head lice are effective for pubic lice (see [Table 5](#d2e1366) and [Figure 2](#ManagementOfPubicLice-CA659370)). The recommended regimens are **permethrin 1%** or **pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide**, with retreatment in 7–9 days.​[[8]](#psc1171n1006)​[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)

If eyelashes are infested, nits and lice can be removed with tweezers. It is suggested that manual removal of lice be followed by an application of an **occlusive nonmedicated eye ointment** (e.g., LacriLube) twice daily for 10 days.​[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB) Regular white petrolatum (“Vaseline”) should be avoided, as it can be irritating to the eyes.​[[13]](#HealthLinkBC.PubicLice.AvailableFro-997B539D) Although more data are needed to determine the efficacy of occlusive agents in asphyxiating lice,​[[47]](#psc1171n1028) it is also thought that the ointment will facilitate removal of any remaining nits.​[[13]](#HealthLinkBC.PubicLice.AvailableFro-997B539D)

Sexual contacts within the previous month should be treated at the same time, if possible.​[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB) Persistent itching may be caused by a reaction to the pediculicide and can be treated with an **oral antihistamine** or **topical corticosteroid**.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)

### Body Lice

Pediculicides are unnecessary. Laundering of clothing and bedding as described in [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1171n00010) is considered effective for the eradication of body lice, and future infestations can be prevented by laundering clothes and bedding at least weekly.​[[10]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-997ACADC)

### Natural Health Products

Several natural health products are used as alternative pediculicides (e.g., anacyclus pyrethrum, anamirta, chrysanthemum flowers, delphinium, field scabious, henna, tea tree oil, black pepper, ranunculus). There is insufficient clinical evidence of efficacy for any of these herbs.​[[19]](#psc1171n1010)​[[61]](#psc1171n01066)

**Lavender oil** and tea tree oil are often used in toiletries and in products to treat head lice. They have been associated with cases of prepubertal gynecomastia in boys with normal endogenous steroid levels.​[[62]](#HenleyDVLipsonNKorachKSEtAl.Prepube-9238C214)

### Monitoring of Therapy

After treatment of head and pubic lice, the dead nits will still be attached to the hair. They can be removed with fingertips, tweezers or a fine-tooth (nit) comb. Observe for any recurrence of lice and nits. Further assessment and/or treatment is required for patients with recurrent or unresponsive head lice or pubic lice following 2 treatments with recommended therapy.

For body lice infestations, inspect clothing and other personal items for the presence of lice.

A secondary bacterial skin infection with redness and pus may develop and may require topical antibacterial treatment. A monitoring plan for patients with pediculosis can be found in [Table 2](#psc1171n00020).

**Table 2:** Monitoring of Therapy for Lice​[[9]](#psc1171n1007)

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Treatment | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Detection of live lice | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Absence of live lice 24 h after applying pediculicide | Treat again with pediculicide 7–10 days after initial application to eradicate any recently hatched immature nymphs. Presence of adult lice may indicate resistance and need for change of therapy. |
| Presence of nits | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Absence of nits | Vinegar, nit comb to physically remove dead nits. |
| Pruritus | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Relief of pruritus | Oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids. |
| Inflammatory pustules | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Clearing of any lesions and return to normal appearance of the skin within 1 wk of treatment | If mild, topical antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin/polymyxin B). If unresponsive or extensive, systemic antibiotics may be necessary. Note that inflammatory pustules are not always infectious (may be due to host inflammatory response), in which case they would be unresponsive to antibiotics. |

### Scabies

### Pathophysiology

Scabies is a highly contagious infestation of the skin with the microscopic human mite, *Sarcoptes scabiei* var. *hominis*. It can occur across all socioeconomic levels. Cycles of epidemics every 7–15 years occur in crowded living conditions and in institutions.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[63]](#psc1171n1031) See [Table 2](#psc1171n00020) for information on the characteristics and assessment of scabies.

Immunocompromised hosts such as patients with HIV infection or lymphoma or institutionalized elderly persons may develop an atypical, hyperkeratotic and more contagious form of scabies called crusted scabies (also referred to as Norwegian scabies). Patients present with pronounced thickened skin patches that primarily affect the face, scalp, hands and feet but may be generalized. The lesions may be malodorous, and pruritus is minimal. Infested persons have huge numbers of mites (often hundreds of thousands) and this infection carries a high mortality rate due to secondary infection and sepsis.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[64]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-92459788)​[[65]](#psc1171n1033)​[[66]](#psc1171n1034)

### Goals of Therapy

- Exterminate scabies mites
- Relieve pruritus
- Prevent secondary bacterial infections
- Prevent spread of the infestation
- Prevent reinfestation

### Patient Assessment

[Table 3](#psc1171n00025) provides characteristics and assessment of scabies.

Suspect scabies in all patients with a pruritic rash, especially if it worsens at night. Papules appearing on the genitalia and breasts when other household members have similar signs and symptoms strengthen the diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis should be made by an appropriate health-care practitioner prior to treatment.​[[66]](#psc1171n1034)

Definitive diagnosis is made by mounting scrapings from nonexcoriated burrows, papules or vesicles in potassium hydroxide onto a slide and examining under direct microscopy. Any sign of a mite, eggs or fecal material is a positive test.​[[72]](#CurrieB.J.2013.ANovelClinicalGradin-DD216D08)​[[73]](#ShimoseL.Munoz-PriceL.S.2013.Diagno-DD2174EF) The **burrow ink test** may help to visualize burrows: apply ink or washable marker to skin in the area of a suspected burrow, wipe away the ink with alcohol, burrows will retain the ink and be visible.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[74]](#WendelKRompaloA.ScabiesAndPediculos-9B935E49)

| Appearance​ [a] | Mites: up to 0.3–0.45 mm in length (eggs 0.1–0.15 mm), not usually visible to the human eye but may appear as tiny black or white dots on the skin. Rounded body with 4 pairs of legs, no wings. Usually visualized (for diagnosis) by looking at skin scrapings under a microscope. |
| Life cycle​ [a] | Impregnated female burrows (creates a tunnel) into the uppermost layer (stratum corneum) of the epidermis, depositing feces along its path, and lays 2 or 3 eggs daily. She remains in the burrow and continues to lay eggs for her lifespan of 1–2 months. Three or 4 days later, the eggs hatch into larvae with 6 legs that travel from the burrow to the skin surface where they mature into adult mites within 14–17 days. On warm skin, mites are capable of crawling 2.5 cm per minute. The smaller male mite lives predominantly on the skin surface and dies shortly after mating with the female mite. Patients typically harbour an average of 10–12 mites. |
| Survival time away from host​ [a] | Mites: 2–3 days. In a cool, humid environment, survival may be increased up to about 19 days. |
| Lesions/symptoms | Pruritus: intense pruritus (worse at night) as a result of sensitization to the mites, eggs or feces starting after 2–6 wk with first infection, and within 1–2 days with reinfection. Primary lesions: linear or wavy silvery lines (burrows) 2–5 mm long with papules and vesicles near burrows. Children may have atypical lesions. Secondary lesions: scratching leads to excoriations that may become secondarily infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococci pyogenes leading to pustules, furunculosis and impetigo. In areas of high prevalence, scabies is a risk factor for developing acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Pruritus due to an inflammatory response to the pediculicide or an allergic reaction to mites and their feces may persist for 4–6 wk after treatment and does not necessarily indicate treatment failure. See photo, Scabies. |
| Distribution of mites | Fingerwebs, wrists, sides of hands and feet, axillae, groin, areola and nipples, belt line. Face and scalp spared in adults but not in infants and young children, the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. Children: lesions are often concentrated on hands, feet, scalp and body folds. |
| Transmission | Most commonly through close personal contact, particularly sexual contact. Spread by fomites such as furniture and towels is rare unless there was contact with patients with a very high parasite load. Animals do not spread human scabies. Scabies mites from other species may produce a self-limited infestation in humans but they will not multiply on the human host. |
| Host | More likely in those living in close, crowded conditions. Most common in children. Poor hygiene does not lead to scabies. |
| Differential diagnosis | Flea or insect bites: lesions are usually single or multiple papules. Atopic dermatitis: distribution is typically behind knees or in fold of elbows for children and adults, or on face and outer aspect of knees and elbows for infants. Seborrheic dermatitis: scales in a distribution involving the scalp and face. Impetigo: exhibits honey-coloured exudates and crusting; this may appear as a secondary infection. |

[a] Details regarding appearance, life cycle and survival time away from host vary slightly from one expert source to another; information provided is an approximate average or range as a guideline only.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

- Avoid body contact with others until completion of treatment and follow-up. Children may return to school the day after treatment is completed.​[[64]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-92459788)​[[70]](#CanadianPediatricSociety.PositionSt-DD262191)​[[75]](#NoAuthorsListed.ScabiesManagement.P-EB8183F0)
- Keep fingernails closely trimmed to prevent skin injury resulting from excessive scratching.​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)
- Wash clothes and linens that came in contact with an infested person during the 3 days prior to treatment in soap and hot water (at least 50°C/122°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Alternatively these items may be dry cleaned or stored in sealed plastic bags for 5–7 days.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[64]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-92459788)
- Vacuum all surfaces, rugs, furniture, mattresses and unwashable items; there is generally no need to treat these surfaces with pesticides and it is not recommended.​[[64]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-92459788)
- Scabies is considered a sexually transmitted infection. Assessment for presence of other sexually transmitted infections is recommended in patients diagnosed with scabies.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)

See also [Figure 3](#ManagementOfScabies-CA65961B).

### Pharmacologic Therapy

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of the traditional recommendation to treat close contacts of patients with scabies prophylactically.​[[76]](#FitzGeraldD1GraingerRJReidA.Interve-DD2462A9) However, Health Canada recommends preventive treatment of sexual partners within the last month​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB) and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends treatment (ideally simultaneous) of all household contacts whether symptomatic or not.​[[70]](#CanadianPediatricSociety.PositionSt-DD262191) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that close contacts within the month preceding the infestation should be examined and treated if infested.​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Scabicides.

### Topical Therapy

**Permethrin 5%** is an insecticide that appears to be more effective than all other topical scabicides available in Canada​[[77]](#psc1171n1040)​[[78]](#JohnstonePStrongM.Scabies.Systemati-DE1858C3)​[[79]](#psc1171n01105) and it is the preferred treatment for adults and children >2 months of age.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D) There are limited human studies of permethrin in pregnancy;​[[54]](#psc1171n00031) however, less than 2% of the topical dose of permethrin is absorbed and it is considered the drug of choice for treating scabies in pregnant and breastfeeding patients.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[80]](#FerreiraEMartinBMorinC.GrossesseEtA-DDA6087F) Concerns about emerging resistance to permethrin are not supported by evidence, and experts suggest that incorrect/incomplete treatment, reinfestation or other factors related to high-risk groups may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of scabies seen in some areas.​[[81]](#RosumeckSNastADresslerC.IvermectinA-924A31EF)​[[82]](#SunderkotterCAebischerANeufeldMEtAl-924B8D45)

**Topical** ivermectin was found to have similar efficacy to permethrin in a systematic review, but is not available for this indication in Canada.​[[81]](#RosumeckSNastADresslerC.IvermectinA-924A31EF)

Comparative trials of other scabicides, including **sulfur** and **crotamiton**, have produced equivocal results suggesting there is no most effective second-line agent.​[[77]](#psc1171n1040)

Topical **sulfur** has many mechanisms of action including keratolytic, fungicidal, parasiticidal and antibacterial activity. Its germicidal activity may be the result of conversion to pentathionic acid by epidermal cells or by certain microorganisms. In organisms without lungs, such as insects or plants, sulfur prevents respiration. There is limited evidence of efficacy,​[[77]](#psc1171n1040)​[[83]](#SharquieKE1Al-RawiJRNoaimiAAAl-Hass-DDA256B7) but it is often recommended in a petrolatum base as therapy for infants <2 months of age due to low risk of toxicity.​[[70]](#CanadianPediatricSociety.PositionSt-DD262191) Odour and mess associated with application reduce adherence and limit use. Sulfur is considered a second-line agent.

**Crotamiton** 10% cream is an antiparasitic agent with an unknown mechanism of action. It reduces itch via a counterirritant effect (creates a cooling sensation as it evaporates from the skin). Crotamiton is less effective than permethrin​[[84]](#PourhasanAGoldustMRezaeeE.Treatment-DDA4DD70) and may be less effective at reducing persistent itch; resistance has been reported.​[[78]](#JohnstonePStrongM.Scabies.Systemati-DE1858C3)​[[85]](#psc1171n1046) It is considered a second-line agent. It was discontinued in Canada in 2023.

Lindane is an effective scabicide; however, there are concerns about possible serious adverse effects​[[39]](#NolanKKamrathJLevittJ.LindaneToxici-DA7DA103)​[[40]](#LoomisDEtAl.CarcinogenicityOfLindan-DA7DA7EC) and it is no longer available in Canada.

See also [Figure 3](#ManagementOfScabies-CA65961B) and [Table 6](#d2e1057).

### Systemic Therapy

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent commonly used worldwide for various parasitic infections.

Systemic treatment of scabies with oral ivermectin may be recommended in the following situations in which topical treatment is difficult or has a high failure rate:

- Severe or resistant scabies​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)
- Treatment of patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states
- Crusted (Norwegian) scabies​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)​[[78]](#JohnstonePStrongM.Scabies.Systemati-DE1858C3)
- Institutional outbreaks. Epidemics of scabies occur frequently in hospitals, nursing homes, residential facilities and other isolated communities. Control of an epidemic can best be achieved by treating the entire population at risk, making topical treatment difficult to coordinate. Epidemics should be managed in consultation with a specialist​[[37]](#WorkowskiKABolanGA.SexuallyTransmit-DDA3AB5D)​[[90]](#DermNetNZ.InstitutionalScabies.Avai-DE151C95)​[[91]](#Ortega-LoayzaAGMcCallCONunleyJR.Cru-DE156A63)​[[92]](#BouvresseSChosidowO.ScabiesInHealth-DE1571A5)

No serious drug-related adverse events due to ivermectin have been reported. Adverse effects are thought to result from the death of parasites rather than adverse effects from the drug. Low levels of ivermectin are detected in the CNS as it concentrates in the liver and fat tissue. No significant drug interactions have been reported. It is not recommended in children <15 kg since safety is unknown.​[[56]](#PanahiYPoursalehZGoldustM.TheEffica-DE11D349) However one observational study in infants and children <15 kg showed only mild adverse effects in approximately 4% of patients.​[[57]](#LevyMMartinLBursztejnACEtAl.Ivermec-95D6E6A5) See [Table 6](#d2e1057) for more information, including use in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Monitoring of Therapy

The appearance of new burrows at any stage after treatment is an indication for further treatment. Itch resulting from an immune allergic response to the mite can persist for up to 4 weeks and may be relieved with topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines.​[[12]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianGuidelin-997B51DB)​[[93]](#psc1171n1048)​[[94]](#psc1171n1049) [Table 4](#psc1171n00030) presents a monitoring plan for patients with scabies.

**Table 4:** Monitoring of Therapy for Scabies​[[95]](#psc1171n1044)[[96]](#psc1171n1045)

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Treatment | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Burrows | Patient: daily for the following 2 wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Clearing of burrows over the following 2 wk and return to normal skin appearance | If new burrows are detected, then retreatment with a scabicide is necessary. Ensure nonpharmacologic measures are utilized. |
| Papules | Patient: daily for the following 2 wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Clearing of papules and return to normal skin appearance | If new papules are detected, then retreatment with a scabicide is necessary after 7–10 days . Ensure nonpharmacologic measures are utilized. |
| Pruritus | Patient: daily for several wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Itching should resolve within several (up to 4) wk; itching beyond 4 wk requires reinvestigation of the cause​ [94] | If itching persists for several wk, then antihistamines or topical corticosteroids may be tried as antipruritic agents.​ [85] ​ [97] |
| Pustules, impetigo | Patient: daily for several wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | This secondary infection should improve with 3 days of topical antibacterial (bacitracin/polymyxin B) treatment | If no improvement or worsening within 3 days of treatment, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |

**Table 6:** Therapy for the Treatment of Scabies

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Administration Instructions | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Scabicides**

| ivermectin Stromectol $20–40 (4 x 3 mg tablets) | Resistant or severe scabies after failure of topical therapy:​ [b] 200 mcg/kg single dose, repeated in 2 wk. Crusted/Norwegian scabies: 200 mcg/kg single dose on days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15 (and days 22 and 29 in severe, unresponsive cases) in combination with topical permethrin cream. Institutional epidemics when topical therapy fails or is impractical: 200 mcg/kg single dose for the entire at-risk population (repeated in 7–14 days). | Aggravation of symptoms including pruritus, gastrointestinal upset, irritation, headache, rash. | Not a Health Canada–approved use. Not recommended in children <15 kg , as safety is not established. One observational study in infants and children <15 kg reported only mild adverse effects in approximately 4% of patients.​ [57] Safety during pregnancy has not been established; however, no teratogenic or fetotoxic effects have been documented in human pregnancy and it is felt to pose a low risk to the fetus.​ [36] ​ [37] Limited data indicate that ivermectin is poorly transferred into breast milk.​ [58] The CDC considers ivermectin to be probably compatible with breastfeeding.​ [37] |
| permethrin 5%​ [c] Kwellada-P Lotion , Nix Dermal Cream Cream: <$20 Lotion: $40–60 | Single treatment: massage into all skin areas from the neck down to the soles of the feet; every bit of skin must be treated, including the fingernails, waist and genitalia. In infants and young children, the entire head and neck should also be treated. Leave on for 8–14 h without interruption, then wash off (shower may be the best way). Retreatment after 7 days is generally recommended​ [4] ​ [70] ​ [88] as treatment is likely not completely ovicidal.​ [89] | Pruritus, edema, redness/swelling. | Drug of choice for scabies in adults and children >2 months of age.​ [72] ​ [77] ​ [78] ​ [79] Resistance of scabies to permethrin is rare.​ [86] ​ [87] Contraindicated in patients allergic to chrysanthemums. Recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​ [37] ​ [54] ​ [38] |
| sulfur 5–10%​ [d] <$20 | Apply to all skin areas​ [e] QHS for 5–7 days . Infants <2 months : 8–10% in petrolatum. Apply to all skin areas​ [e] QHS for 3 days. ​ [70] | Local irritation or dermatitis with repeated applications. | Limited study data to support use.​ [77] ​ [83] Considered a second-line treatment. Not popular because it is malodorous, requires multiple applications and stains clothing. Extemporaneously compounded. Possible second-line treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​ [80] Has been used in combination with other agents for the treatment of crusted scabies. |
