### Pathophysiology

The skin and its appendages (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) serve several important functions. They protect against minor injury, help control body temperature and water loss, prevent invasion by microorganisms, and prevent radiation damage from sun exposure.​[[1]](#Fluhr-CEBC6120)

The skin is composed of 3 main layers: epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue​[[2]](#PincusLBMcCalmontTH.DiseasesOfTheSk-7C7839A7) (see [Figure 1](#psc1163n00001)). The epidermis consists of 4 or 5 layers of cells, depending on where it is located on the body. Cells migrate upward through the layers, undergoing keratinization and transitioning into flat, nonliving corneocytes that form the thick, brick-like structure of the uppermost part of the epidermis: the stratum corneum. Layers of corneocytes are shed from the stratum corneum at the skin’s surface as new keratinocytes push up from below in a continuous cycle of renewal. Corneocytes contain natural moisturizing factor (NMF), which attracts and binds water from the atmosphere; they are surrounded by a lipid matrix consisting of ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids that prevent water loss and protect against absorption of foreign substances.​[[1]](#Fluhr-CEBC6120)​[[3]](#KolarsickPAJKolarsickMAGoodwinC.Ana-57091293)​[[4]](#JurakicToncicRKezicSLjubojevicHadza-577D3B1F)​[[5]](#psc1163n01007)

Together, the components of the stratum corneum form the skin barrier that protects the lower layers of the epidermis from damage and regulates hydration of the skin. Any environmental or physiologic factor that compromises the stratum corneum skin barrier, leading to an increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) or a decrease in NMF or ceramides and other lipids, can lead to dry skin (see [Table 1](#psc1163n00007)). Accordingly, research in the treatment of dry skin conditions focusses on the effects of therapy on TEWL, NMF and the ceramide content of the skin.​[[6]](#ProkschEBerardescaEMiseryLEtAl.DryS-578FA76B)​[[7]](#psc1163n01008)

“Dry skin” (also known as xeroderma or xerosis cutis) is commonly used to describe skin that may have a rough/coarse texture when touched, mild scaling, flaking or peeling, decreased skin elasticity, wrinkling, and is often very itchy, with possible cracking in severe cases.​[[6]](#ProkschEBerardescaEMiseryLEtAl.DryS-578FA76B)​[[8]](#psc1163n1002)​[[9]](#Augustin-CEBCE8BD)​[[10]](#Gade-CEBD4503) Dry skin most often affects the skin of the thighs, lower legs, sides of the abdomen and the arms but can occur anywhere on the body. The incidence of dry skin increases with age but can occur at any age depending on skin type, environmental factors, medical conditions and chronic skin conditions.​[[8]](#psc1163n1002)

### Goals of Therapy

- Alleviate the unpleasant feel of rough, scaly skin
- Restore skin hydration and reduce transepidermal water loss
- Facilitate repair of the barrier function and maintain the integrity of the stratum corneum
- Relieve itching associated with dry skin
- Educate the patient on self-treatment to prevent further damage

### Patient Assessment

Assessment includes differentiating between dry skin and other skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infections). Patients require further assessment and/or treatment if the condition does not respond to initial treatment for dry skin. Treatment failure may indicate an underlying medical disease or condition. An approach to the patient with concerns about dry skin is presented in [Figure 2](#psc1163n00008). Factors contributing to dry skin are presented in [Table 1](#psc1163n00007).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy of dry skin includes improving skin hydration and mitigating any contributing factors, if possible (see [Table 1](#psc1163n00007)).

Several self-care measures will improve the feeling of dry, rough or itchy skin; offer the following advice:​[[8]](#psc1163n1002)​[[9]](#Augustin-CEBCE8BD)​[[11]](#psc1163n1003)​[[16]](#White-ChuEFReddyM.DrySkinInTheElder-9809C44C)​[[18]](#psc1163n1006)

- Avoid excessive bathing or long baths or showers; have brief 3- to 5-minute baths or showers 2–3 times per week; take sponge baths using warm water to maintain hydration
- Use tepid rather than hot water while bathing or showering
- Avoid harsh, perfumed and bubble bath products
- Limit the use of soap; if used, select soap that is mild and nonperfumed, or use a mild cleanser with a pH close to skin pH (slightly acidic)
- Pat the skin dry (rather than rubbing vigorously) after bathing
- Avoid licking dry lips, as this can further irritate the lips or worsen the condition; apply lip balm frequently to dry, chapped lips
- Increase humidity indoors. Cool mist humidifiers will do this and will also minimize water evaporation from the skin. Aim to keep humidity between 40% and 50% in winter (30% in summer)
- Wear gloves, a face mask and a scarf when outdoors in cold or windy weather to protect the skin from the drying effects of cold and wind
- Avoid wool clothing that may be irritating to the skin; cotton clothing next to the skin is less irritating
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which may contribute to dehydration if ingested in large quantities or used on a regular basis
- Avoid swimming in chlorinated pools
- Avoid products that contain ingredients that may sensitize the skin (e.g., lanolin, propylene glycol, fragrances, parabens),​[[19]](#MilitelloMHuSLaughterMEtAl.American-12EF8DFE) particularly in those with very sensitive skin or in older patients
- Maintain adequate fluid intake from food and water​[[20]](#psc1163n01027)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Dermatitis and Dry Skin, First Aid.

Consistent and liberal use of therapeutic moisturizers is the mainstay of treatment for dry skin (see [Table 2](#TipsMoisturizer)).​[[21]](#KimSLyBKHaJHEtAl.AConsistentSkinCar-7770C32C) Moisturizer products come in various formats (e.g., cream, lotion, ointment, gel), each with its own advantages and disadvantages (see [Table 3](#MoisturizerTypes)).​[[8]](#psc1163n1002)​[[11]](#psc1163n1003)​[[18]](#psc1163n1006)​[[22]](#Barnes2021)

The active ingredients in moisturizers are generally classified as occlusives, humectants, emollients or barrier repair therapies (i.e., ceramides) based on their mechanism of action (see [Table 4](#psc1163n00010)). Some ingredients may have more than one mechanism of action. Most commercial moisturizer products consist of various combinations of ingredient classes in order to increase effectiveness and the ease or appeal of application. In addition to active moisturizing ingredients, products often contain emulsifiers and preservatives and may contain any number of miscellaneous ingredients claiming to have additional beneficial effects on the skin. Natural oils from nuts, fruit, seeds and vegetables (e.g., olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, safflower seed oil) do not penetrate the skin but provide barrier protection, skin softening and hydration by forming an occlusive layer on the epidermis.​[[23]](#Fernandes-CEBF6618)

When skin is very itchy or for severe dry skin resistant to all other treatments, consider the use of products containing urea or lactic acid. However, avoid using these products on cuts or scrapes, as they can cause irritation.

Evidence in patients with atopic dermatitis has shown that the addition of bath oils to bath water does not provide any clinical benefit over standard management with moisturizers​[[24]](#SanterMRumsbyKRiddMJEtAl.BathAdditi-CF814CA7) but poses a possible risk of injury from slipping. If bath oils are used in the treatment of dry skin, it is safer to apply them directly to the damp skin after the bath.

**Table 2:** Tips For Choosing and Using a Moisturizer

| There is no reliable evidence that one moisturizer is better than another. Apply moisturizers while the skin is still damp (within 3 min after bathing) as well as several times a day (3–4 times daily). Applying adequate amounts of moisturizer is more important than which moisturizer is chosen. Choose a moisturizer with an agreeable feel and smell (to encourage use). Avoid products with added fragrance or irritants, e.g., salicylic acid. Choose a noncomedogenic moisturizer for use on the face in the case of acne-prone skin. Avoid any product that stings, burns or irritates on contact. Plain petrolatum jelly, while greasy, is highly effective, nonirritating and inexpensive. Ensure the product is affordable (to encourage adequate use). More costly products may not be superior with respect to risk of containing contact allergens.​ [25] Be aware that many moisturizers may also contain sunscreens to prevent sun-induced skin damage. Note that all moisturizers can dry onto clothing, bedding, bandages or furniture, making them more flammable. Use caution when near open flames and wash clothing and bedding regularly to reduce moisturizer build-up.​ [26] |

| Moisturizer Format | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cream | Easily absorbed with minimal residue, easily spread, cosmetically appealing | Shorter duration of effect, may sting upon application to irritated skin |
| Lotion | Easily absorbed with minimal residue, cosmetically appealing, thin, easy to spread over large or hairy areas | Shorter duration of effect, may sting upon application to irritated skin |
| Ointment | Longer duration of effect (water resistant), forms protective barrier, less likely to sting upon application to irritated skin | Greasy, thick, sticky, cosmetically less acceptable, difficult to wash off, may be difficult to spread |
| Water-based gel | Lightweight, easily absorbed, easy to apply and wash off, may be more suitable for use on the face due to low oil content (cosmetically appealing) | Less effective, shortest duration of effect, removed by perspiration; alcohol-based gel may be irritating |

| Type | Action | Examples​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Occlusives | Physically block surface of stratum corneum to reduce TEWL, which promotes barrier repair. Minimizing water loss to the external environment allows the stratum corneum to draw water from the deeper layers of the epidermis and from the dermis. | Hydrocarbons, e.g., petrolatum, mineral oil, paraffin, squalene Silicone-based polymers, e.g., cyclomethicone, dimethicone Plant oils, e.g., coconut oil, castor oil, grape seed oil, hemp oil, jojoba oil, soybean oil Animal fats, e.g., mink oil, lanolin Wax esters, e.g., beeswax, lanolin Sterols, e.g., cholesterol, ceramides Zinc oxide (also added as a sunscreen) | Petrolatum is very effective but not cosmetically appealing (greasy, difficult to spread and remove). Lanolin may cause contact dermatitis; avoid in patients with sensitive skin. Occlusives are generally not well tolerated on facial skin or in hot, humid climates due to their greasy nature. Silicone-based polymers are often found in “oil-free” products. Apply TID–QID PRN. |
| Humectants | Contain compounds that attract and bind water, causing water to be drawn from the deeper layers of the epidermis and from the dermis into the stratum corneum. Retain water already present. | Glycerin (most effective), alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), colloidal oatmeal, glycolic acid, honey, lactic acid, propylene glycol, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, urea | Unless used in combination with occlusives, some humectants may increase TEWL and exacerbate dryness. Glycerin in high concentrations may increase TEWL by drawing water away from the skin and may be irritating. Not to be used alone or in those with sensitive skin. Lactic acid (>12%) and urea (>10%) are keratolytic and used for treatment of more severe skin conditions. Lower concentrations are recommended as moisturizing agents (lactic acid ≤12% and urea ≤10%). Urea improves itching but may cause stinging and burning on open skin in any concentration. Apply BID–TID PRN. |
| Emollients | Have some occlusive properties (see above), but main function is to fill the spaces between cells in the stratum corneum, sealing moisture into the skin, which makes it feel smoother and softer. | Castor oil, ceramides, cocoa butter, coconut oil, colloidal oatmeal, fatty acids, lanolin, lipids, mineral oil, palm oil, vitamins A and E, wool fat | Combining with emulsifiers (stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol) may improve the oil/water balance of the product, making it more cosmetically appealing. May be combined with occlusives to decrease water loss. Apply TID–QID PRN. |
| Barrier repair agents | Normalize skin barrier by replacing ceramides, decreasing TEWL and decreasing triggers for inflammation. | Ceramides/cholesterol/free fatty acids combinations | Used to treat dry skin and associated pruritus in atopic, irritant and radiation dermatitis. |

### Monitoring of Therapy

Mild to moderate dry skin can be self-managed by patients educated on nonpharmacologic methods of treatment and prevention. Advise patients to monitor the skin daily for 7–10 days after starting treatment for improvement in symptoms and to seek medical attention if the condition worsens or shows no improvement.

[Table 5](#psc1163n00012) provides a plan for monitoring therapy for dry skin.

**Table 5:** Monitoring of Therapy for Dry Skin

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rough, scaly skin | Monitor daily for 7–10 days for signs of improvement with treatment (moisturizers or nonpharmacologic methods). | Skin feels smoother, has returned to its normal colour, is no longer rough or irritated. If irritation worsens, consider allergy to moisturizer ingredient. | If allergy to moisturizer ingredient is suspected (i.e., irritation worsens), discontinue and switch to another product. |
| Itching | Monitor daily for 7–10 days for decrease in symptoms with treatment (moisturizers or nonpharmacologic methods). Monitor for signs of infection if scratching has caused open areas. | Itching has decreased or is controlled (no scratching or signs of infection). | If itching does not improve, consider the addition of a second moisturizer from a different group for an additive effect. If itching increases, consider the possibility of sensitization to the product and try switching to a moisturizer without the sensitizing agent (e.g., lanolin). Signs of infection (pus, pain, colour change) require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Dry, flaky skin | Monitor daily while using moisturizing products. Monitor for signs of improvement. | Dry, flaky skin has decreased or skin is soft and hydrated. | If skin continues to be dry and flaky, consider using an occlusive agent or a thicker vehicle (e.g., ointment). |
