### Introduction

Dressings are applied to minor and major wounds to protect them from damage and contamination, promote wound healing and, in some cases, prevent initial wounds.​[[1]](#WoundsCanada.BestPracticeRecommenda-70E6A816) The focus of this chapter is dressings; for information related to other aspects of wounds and wound care, see Minor Cuts and Wounds and Pressure Ulcers.

Wounds may be acute or chronic, and minor or extensive. Examples of chronic wounds include peripheral vascular ulcers, pressure injuries (“bed sores”) and ulcers secondary to medical conditions such as diabetes. Examples of extensive wounds include deep wounds or wounds that have had tissue torn from them. All wounds, including minor or postsurgical wounds, require dressings that are specific for the type of wound. It is important to note that as the wound heals or changes, the required type of dressing may change.

In general, dressings help to stop bleeding, support proper moisture balance and protect the wound from debris, microorganisms and further damage.​[[2]](#Panesa-73A4431C) An ideal dressing maintains a moist environment to encourage wound healing while removing excess exudate to prevent maceration.​[[3]](#Nuutila-73A461F9) Wounds that are painful benefit from dressings that “soothe” nerve endings by keeping the wound moist and cool. [Table 1](#psc1074n00010) lists some of the common characteristics of dressings.

**Table 1:** Characteristics of an Ideal Dressing

| Provides mechanical protection : provides protection from debris and contact with clothing or other surfaces Provides a moist environment : a moist environment will accelerate epidermal migration and dermal repair; however, if there is too much moisture, skin maceration could occur Provides thermal insulation : a drop in temperature below 37°C delays mitotic activity for up to 4 h Is highly absorptive for exudate : excess exudate can macerate healthy tissue Can relieve wound pain : various dressings are able to protect the wound from external factors, absorb moisture and have a cooling effect, all of which reduce the sensation of pain Is impermeable to bacteria : bacteria and other microorganisms can colonize a wound Is free of contaminants : dressings should be sterile, and a sterile technique should be used in their application Is nonadherent : dressings that adhere to wounds can cause further tissue damage especially when being removed or when the surrounding skin is fragile Is easily changed : infrequent changes are ideal; the wound and surrounding tissue should not be damaged with the changes Is elastic and has sufficient integrity : dressings should not fall off the skin with normal activity Is biocompatible with tissue : dressings should not cause adverse effects such as allergies, sensitivities or tissue damage. Note: some antiseptics and hypochlorites can be toxic to tissue Is comfortable, conforming and suitable for the wound : the size and location of the wound as well as the acceptability to patients must be considered Is safely disposable : once used, contaminated dressings should be discarded in an environmentally safe manner Is not expired : expiry dates should always be checked Is cost effective |

### Dressing Types

Dressings are defined as materials that are applied to wounds, while bandages (if required) are used to hold these dressings in place.​[[4]](#Ghomi-73A489EA) Bandages have been used for millennia to manage wounds.​[[5]](#Queen-73A4735E) Dressings have developed over time as knowledge on wound healing has evolved; today’s dressings are mostly synthetic.

Primary dressings cover the wound and often come into contact with the wound, while secondary dressings cover the primary dressings and include dressings and bandages. Contact dressings are layers that are applied directly to the wound. The occlusive nature of the dressing can vary from totally occlusive to nonocclusive; the moisture vapour barrier or the “breathability” of the dressing is an important consideration in dressing selection.

### Gauze

Gauze acts as an absorbent and a protectant. It is made by weaving bleached cotton into an open-mesh cloth. Natural waxes and impurities are removed from the cotton to increase its absorbing capacity. Gauze is classified either according to its mesh or to the number of threads per inch. Traditional gauze dressings (e.g., cotton bandages) are not recommended for use as primary dressings as they are nonocclusive, drying and adhere to the wound, which may lead to trauma, pain and bleeding when removed.​[[6]](#Jones-73A4463F) Furthermore, there are a wide variety of other types of dressings available that are superior in promoting wound healing (i.e., occlusive, moisten the wound and/or nonadherent); see [Protective Dressings](#psc1074n00012) for more information.​[[4]](#Ghomi-73A489EA)

Alternatives to traditional gauze dressings include:

- Self-adherent gauze clings to itself and is available as pads or rolls. It can be used as a bandage to wrap a wound without the need for adhesive tape (e.g., for a head wound). Viscous rayon and regenerated cellulose are also used in bandages, sometimes in conjunction with gauze.
- Nonadherent gauze is easily removable, yet still protective. It is prepared by impregnating viscous rayon with an oil-in-water emulsion or by covering the gauze with a perforated plastic film. When removed, nonadherent gauze does not leave gauze threads on the wound surface, nor does it disturb the wound surface by “pulling” or removing any of the surface. For some wounds, it can be used as a primary dressing because of increased comfort and ease of removal; however, gauze is not recommended as a primary dressing due to the availability of superior products.

### Adhesive Tape

Adhesive tape is used to secure a dressing or bandage to a wound. Several types are available in a variety of widths, including waterproof, cloth and paper. The choice of tape depends on the size and type of wound, potential skin sensitivities, and personal preference. In general, hypoallergenic and easy-to-remove adhesive tapes are preferred. For maximal adhesion, tape should be applied to dry, non-oily skin. For wounds that require protection from water or dirt, waterproof tape is preferred. Paper or cloth tape reduces the risk of skin damage for fragile skin and is preferred for wounds that require frequent dressing changes.

Adhesive tape is a fabric or film evenly coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive mixture. Today, most adhesives are acrylate-based; historically, they were rubber-based. Acrylate-based adhesives tend to produce fewer allergic reactions and thus are generally termed hypoallergenic. While some reports estimate adhesive tape allergies occur in 0.3% of patients, true allergic reactions represent a small fraction of reactions to adhesive tape.​[[7]](#SmithSMZirwasMJNonallergicReactions-C780AE21) Rather, the irritation may be considered a nonallergic tape reaction caused by such factors as the mechanics of tape removal (e.g., repeated removal or skin stripping, removal from a hair-covered area of skin). Although rare, adhesive tape reactions may be severe, especially if the patient has existing dermatitis or a fragile skin surface.

### Self-Adhesive Bandages

Self-adhesive bandages are most commonly a combination of gauze and adhesive tape with adhesive borders on all sides; they are more convenient alternatives to gauze and tape. They are individually prepackaged for sterility and ease of use for minor wounds such as cuts and scrapes.

The correct size and shape of the self-adhesive bandage needs to be chosen for the wound. The bandage should be large enough to cover the wound completely, yet not too large since this could cause the wound not to be covered securely (impairing healing) or causing the self-adhesive bandage to “bunch” and come loose from the wound. If the bandage is too small, the adhesive could adhere to the wound, making removal difficult or for a portion of the wound to be exposed.

For wounds on body areas that are difficult to bandage, such as fingertips and knuckles, specially shaped self-adhesive bandages are available. Butterfly closures are self-adhesive bandages that pull and hold the edges of small wounds together to encourage healing; however, they are not a substitute for stitches in larger or deeper wounds.

### Protective Dressings

Protective dressings are primary dressings that act in a mechanical or physical manner, or a combination of both. Physical dressings only provide a physical barrier, whereas mechanical dressings provide a physical barrier and perform other functions; examples include tissue adhesives, absorbents for exudate and wound débridement agents. Protective dressings may be self-adherent or may require a secondary dressing (e.g., gauze and adhesive tape) to secure them. [Table 2](#psc1074n00101) summarizes the functions of each type of protective dressing.

**Table 2:** Protective Dressings​[[6]](#Jones-73A4463F)[[8]](#BeldonP-9282F2E7)[[9]](#Sood-9283A628)

| Dressing Type and Examples​[a] | Materials | Characteristics and Uses | Precautions | Wear time (i.e., frequency of dressing change)​[b] | Secondary dressing required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acrylic dressings Examples: Tegaderm Absorbant Clear Acrylic | Acrylic polymer pads Usually transparent Should not be cut | Easily removed due to lower ability to adhere to the skin Long wear time (14–21 days) Reduce the number of required dressing changes Usually transparent, which allows for wound monitoring | Should not be cut | Up to 14– 21 days | Self-adherent |
| Alginate dressings Examples: Algisite, Biatain Alginate, Kaltostat | Made from seaweed Some have higher guluronic acid content (allowing them to retain their shape)​ [c] while some have higher mannuronic acid content (don't retain their shape; form a soft gel, which is easily washed out of the wound; e.g., Algisite, Kaltostat) | Can absorb up to 20 times their weight and so are ideal for highly exudating or draining wounds Create a moist environment while absorbing exudate and blood Have hemostatic properties since they release calcium ions, which improve blood clotting Those with higher guluronic acid​ [c] content retain their shape and can be lifted off the wound in one piece Those with higher mannuronic acid content are less likely to retain their shape; however, are easily washed out of the wound with sterile saline Useful in cavities and sinuses where the end of the wound can be visualized | Can dehydrate the wound; unsuitable for wounds with light exudate/eschar Alginates may need frequent dressing changes due to the amount of exudate they absorb May sting on wound contact Have an odour, especially when changing them | In uninfected wounds, up to 7 days Change at least daily if wound is infected | Most require secondary dressing |
| Collagen dressings Examples: ColActive, Promogran | Made from collagen (found in skin, bones, ligaments and cartilage) derived from animal sources | During wound healing, collagen promotes the deposition and organization of new tissue in the wound bed. These dressings act as scaffolding for new tissue growth, aid in the growth of new blood vessels, reduce inflammation and help bring the wound edges together Maintain a moist healing environment and absorb water and blood Usually nonadherent; easy to apply and remove Available as sheets, pads, particles, solutions and gels, these dressings are used in partial thickness burns, skin graft donor sites and ulcers (including pressure injuries) | Animal-derived, which may be may be of concern to some patients (e.g., vegans, some faith groups, history of allergy) Can cause maceration and lose efficacy if they become saturated | Up to 7 days | Most require secondary dressing |
| Contact layers Examples: Adaptic, Mepitel | Thin, single layers of woven net (usually a polyamide), which are placed in contact with the wound Low adherence material Sometimes perforated | Protect the wound from direct contact with other dressing layers and preserve the wound healing process Not intended to be changed with every dressing change and can remain in place If perforated product is selected, it allows exudate to pass to a secondary dressing | Minimal ability to absorb exudate | Up to 7– 14 days | Require secondary dressing |
| Cyanoacrylate compounds Commonly called “liquid bandages” or “artificial skin” Examples: New Skin | Tissue adhesives used to close small wounds Traditionally, both collodion (a viscous solution of pyroxylin in ether and alcohol) and flexible collodion (also contains camphor and castor oil) have been used to seal small wounds​ [10] | Cyanoacrylate liquid skin protectant can be used on minor cuts and skin fissures​ [11] Waterproof May reduce scarring | There may be slight burning upon application | Up to 10 days | Secondary dressing not required |
| Film dressings Examples: Opsite, Tegaderm | Semipermeable, polyurethane membrane dressings that vary in thickness and size Often transparent, which allows for wound monitoring | Semipermeable; allow fluid to evaporate while keeping the wound moist Allow oxygen to reach wound, which facilitates wound healing Prevent bacterial contamination Can be used alone or in conjunction with other dressings Comfortable and resistant to shearing | Do not absorb exudate. Should not be used in wounds with moderate to large amounts of drainage They should not be used alone with infected wounds Can cause damage to fragile skin and are not recommended | Up to 4–7 days | Most are not self-adhesive so require secondary dressing Some are self-adhesive; these may be used as a primary dressing |
| Foam dressings Examples: Allevyn, Aquacel Foam, Biatain Foam, Mepilex Foam | Product of advanced polymer technology Some are nonadherent, some have an adhesive border and some have a film coating to provide an additional bacterial barrier | Hydrophilic polyurethane dressings can absorb several times their weight in exudate, thus are ideal for wounds with light to heavy exudate Can be used as either a primary or secondary dressing on a wide variety of wounds (e.g., partial- to full-thickness wounds, varying levels of drainage) Do not adhere to the wound Useful in flat, shallow wounds | Because of their ability to absorb exudate, they should not be used for dry wounds or ones with eschar Can cause maceration if they become saturated May have odour when wet Those with adhesive border may cause skin stripping if skin is fragile | Up to 3 days | Require secondary dressing even though some have an adhesive border |
| Hydrocolloid dressings Examples: Duoderm CGF, Comfeel Plus, Tegaderm Thin: DuoDerm Extra Thin, Comfeel Plus Transparent, Tegaderm Thin | Mixture of pectins, gelatins and sodium carboxymethylcellulose Available as films and sheets | Usually occlusive/non-breathable and impermeable to bacteria/contaminates; minimize water evaporation of skin Remove exudate by mixing with it Suitable for sloughing/necrotic wounds and those with low/medium exudate Flexible and mould well to the wound (useful in non-flat surfaces, e.g., heel, elbow, sacrum); comfortable while minimizing skin trauma Can be cut to size but should exceed wound by at least 2 cm . Usually biodegradable | Can cause maceration since they are occlusive Some ingredients (e.g., sodium carboxymethylcellulose) may be animal-sourced, which may be a concern for some patients (vegans, some faith groups, history of allergy) | Up to 7 days | Usually self-adhesive |
| Hydroconductive dressings Examples: Drawtex, Vitale | Pads and dressing ropes combining natural and synthetic fibres including viscose, cotton, polyester arranged in 2 types of absorbent, cross-action structures​ [12] Found in a variety of composite dressings | Remove exudate, bacteria and wound debris due to a combination of capillary, hydroconductive and electrostatic actions​ [13] Suitable for acute wounds such as surgical wounds and burns, as well as chronic wounds such as foot and pressure ulcers May require a nonadherent layer next to wound Can be folded and/or cut | Not indicated for third-degree burn wounds Because of their ability to absorb fluid, they should not be used for dry wounds or ones with eschar | Change every 1–3 days , or at least every 7 days If exudate seepage is seen, a change of dressing is needed along with re-evaluation of the wound | Require secondary dressing |
| Hydrofiber dressings Examples: Aquacel, Durafiber | Soft, nonwoven sodium carboxymethylcellulose fibres that form gels when they come into contact with wound exudate May be impregnated with antimicrobials such as ionic silver Available as sheets as well as “ropes” for tunnel wounds | Highly absorbent, moisture-retaining dressings. Useful for moderate/high exudating wounds The gel promotes a moist environment yet contains the exudate Fibrin collects between the dressing and wound surface, keeping the dressing in place, enabling easy application and removal, and reducing pain during dressing changes Useful in flat surfaces, cavities and sinuses where the end of the wound can be visualized | May stick to edges of wound; avoid overlapping with surrounding skin | Up to 4–7 days | Require secondary dressing |
| Hydrogel dressings Examples: Aqua-Flo, Duoderm Hydroactive Gel, Intrasite Gel | Matrices containing a high percentage of water (gel form contains 60–70% water; sheets contain less water) Available as both sheets and gels | Create moist environment so often used on dry wounds with minimal drainage Do not absorb exudate Ideal for sloughing/necrotic wounds Cooling effect of gel can reduce pain and discomfort Sheets are polysaccharides cross-linked with polyacrylamide; they are not self-adhesive so are less painful to remove in sensitive skin Gel forms are useful in flat surfaces, cavities and sinuses. Sheets are ideal for shallow wounds (e.g., burns) Some are transparent so wound surface can be seen | Can cause maceration if wound has high level of exudate since they do not absorb exudate | Up to 3 days | Most are not self-adhesive so require secondary dressing Some are self-adhesive; these may be used as a primary dressing |
| Composite dressings Examples: Alldress, Mesorb, Mextra Superabsorbent, TenderWet | Combine 2 or more layers of physically distinct products (e.g., alginate, foam, hydrocolloid) in a single dressing to serve multiple functions | Often used in complex wounds as they provide multiple benefits (e.g., absorption, moisture control, physical protection) or for wounds with multiple stages of healing Becoming more commonly used because of their practicality Useful for fistulas and sinuses | Varies based on the composition of the dressing | Varies based on the composition of the dressing | Varies based on the composition of the dressing |

[a] These products are not an extensive list; they are listed as examples only and do not imply recommendation of one brand over another.

[b] This is an estimate only; timeline can vary based on clinical situation, manufacturer instructions and wound care protocols. In all situations, the dressing should be changed if it becomes saturated, becomes soiled, or if it changes colour. Increased frequency of dressing changes may be required if wound is infected.

[c] Currently, there are no dressing available in Canada that have higher guluronic acid content

### Medicated Dressings

Dressings may be impregnated with various agents to achieve therapeutic effects. Gauze, hydrocolloids, hydrogels, alginates, foams and films (see [Table 2](#psc1074n00101)) are the types of dressing most often used to deliver medications.

- Petrolatum-impregnated dressings (e.g., petrolatum gauze) are easily removed and act as a protectant for underlying tissues; they reduce the risk for skin tears.
- **Hypertonic saline** in gauze is able to absorb exudate, reduce the risk of maceration and aid in débridement (the removal of foreign material as well as dead tissue). Dressings containing water or saline can support moisture balance and prevent dehydration.
- **Antimicrobial**-containing dressings (e.g., framycetin sulfate, silver ions) do not have robust evidence to support their use; avoid their use due to their higher cost, limited effectiveness and the potential for development of antimicrobial resistance.​[[14]](#KhansaISchoenbrunnerARKraftCTEtAl.S-7874CC31) If used, they are not a substitute for appropriate and effective wound cleansing and débridement. Staining of the surrounding skin, stinging upon application, sensitization, systemic absorption and allergy are recognized risks. It should be noted that silver-impregnated dressings should be used for only 2 weeks, then reassessed. For maximal effectiveness, antibiotic-containing dressings need to be applied directly to the wound surface. Patients showing signs of clinical infections (e.g., pus, pain, warmth, swelling) must be assessed by a health-care professional as use of an antibiotic-containing dressing may delay appropriate treatment and systemic antibiotics may be required.
- **Antiseptic**-containing dressings (e.g., chlorhexidine, cadexomer iodine and povidone/iodine) do not have robust evidence to support their use and are not a substitute for appropriate and effective wound cleansing and débridement.​[[15]](#NormanGDumvilleJCMohapatraDPEtAl.An-71E1612D) Additionally, systemic absorption may complicate their use, especially with wounds covering large areas. Povidone/iodine and cadexomer iodine dressings may be useful for wounds with a foul discharge; however, they should be used with caution in patients with thyroid disorders, renal disease, in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, and in infants <6 months of age.​[[1]](#WoundsCanada.BestPracticeRecommenda-70E6A816) Hypochlorites are no longer used in medicated dressings because of the risk for tissue damage.
- Medical grade honey has antibacterial activity that may be related to its low pH, osmotic effects, and the presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal substances. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may contribute to its wound-healing effects.​[[16]](#TashkandiH.HoneyInWoundHealingAnUpd-78DDDDD9)​[[17]](#IsrailiZH.AntimicrobialPropertiesOf-70E880D4)​[[18]](#CooperR.HoneyAsAnEffectiveAntimicro-78DDA576) There is evidence that topical honey speeds healing of different types of wounds including burns and infected surgical wounds.​[[19]](#JullABCullumNDumvilleJCEtAl.HoneyAs-70E83CB0)​[[20]](#NormanGChristieJLiuZEtAl.Antiseptic-78DF721D)
- Ibuprofen dressings contain the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which reduces acute wound inflammation and pain. These dressings are designed for painful exuding wounds such as pressure injuries, leg ulcers and foot ulcers. Because these dressings are topically applied, systemic absorption is minimized with a lower risk for adverse effects; however, allergy and/or sensitivity is possible at the wound site.​[[21]](#Arapoglou-73A56233)
- Dressings containing silicone compounds are semipermeable, nonadhesive skin barriers that provide protection from skin-damaging materials such as urine and feces, minimize pressure ulceration, reduce the risk of skin tears, and assist to maintain skin integrity. Many composite dressings contain silicone in order to facilitate ease of removal.​[[22]](#White)

### Dressings for Scar Reduction

Silicone gel sheets and polyurethane self-adhesive patches have been shown to reduce scarring.​[[23]](#Diaz-73A5782F) While the mechanism of action is unclear, it is thought to involve the occlusion of the wound site and the normalization of skin cell production. These dressings are effective for hypertrophic scars (thick, raised scars that occur within the wound site) and keloid scars (thick, raised scars that extend beyond the edges of a wound).​[[24]](#Bleasdale-73A59B33) Conversely, scar formation is reduced with proper wound care and should always be the first approach to reduce scar formation (see Minor Cuts and Wounds and Pressure Ulcers for more information).​[[25]](#AADA)

### Natural Dressings

Historically, herbal and natural preparations have been used as dressings for wounds; examples include calendula, aloe vera, tea tree, lavender, oregano and St. John’s wort. Calendula and aloe vera are available in some hydrogel dressings.​[[26]](#Chelu-73ACB689)​[[27]](#Shedoeva-73ACD1E7) Natural dressings have not been well studied, present the risk of product contamination and can elicit allergic reactions; these risks and the fact that manufactured synthetic dressings are considered more efficacious​[[28]](#Nikam-73AC9AA6) mean that natural dressings are not recommended.

### Choice of Dressings

The choice of dressing depends upon the characteristics of the wound, patient characteristics and cost. Primary factors are wound etiology, classification, size, shape, and the amount and type of healing that has occurred; see [Table 3](#psc1074n00014) for key criteria to consider when selecting dressings. The acronym TIME (tissue, infection, moisture, edge) is useful when assessing a wound and selecting a wound dressing:

- **Tissue**: assessment of the area is critical. Bleeding needs to be stopped by applying pressure; however, severe bleeding requires a referral. The wound may require cleansing and it should be assessed for depth/severity. The presence of extensive debris, slough or necrotic/nonviable tissue requires débridement and may require a referral.
- **Infection**: infected wounds need to be treated promptly because they are painful and if left untreated, the infection will delay healing and may extend deeper into tissue (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis) or spread systemically (e.g., sepsis). Infected wounds can become chronic and lead to tissue necrosis and gangrene. While antimicrobial dressings are available, they should not be used without consultation with a health-care professional and some (e.g., silver-impregnated dressings) should not be used for more than 2 weeks without reassessment. While topical antibiotics may be suitable for minor wounds, a systemic antibiotic may be considered when systemic symptoms of infection are present and/or if the person has immunosuppressive comorbidities, which increases the risk of a chronic wound.
- **Moisture**: excessive or insufficient moisture is important when selecting a dressing. The presence of an exudate must be considered as it hinders healing because it inhibits cell growth, contributes to bacterial imbalance, increases necrotic tissue development, and reduces the migration of key cells (e.g., keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) needed for healing. Excessive moisture may also cause maceration of the tissue surrounding the wound, impair healing and affect the edge of the wound. Conversely, too little moisture impedes wound healing, results in dehydrated tissues and can exacerbate wound pain. Compression therapy, mechanical devices (e.g., some débridement materials) and absorptive dressings are used to reduce exudate.
- **Edge**: the appearance of the wound edges and surrounding skin influence the dressing size and adhesive choice. Wound edges need to have healthy skin in order to affix the dressing; if the skin is fragile, considerations must include the method of dressing removal as well as the potential for skin irritation.​[[29]](#Sinha-73A54A48)

The potential for débridement can affect the choice of dressing. An occlusive dressing maintains a moist environment that results in autolytic or self-débridement. Wet-to-dry dressings and irrigation will mechanically débride a wound but may remove healthy as well as dead tissue. Due to the risk of skin sensitivity and the availability of more effective methods, chemical or enzymatic débridement is reserved for specific, problematic wounds and should be performed only by a trained health-care professional. Physical débridement (e.g., using clean tweezers to remove debris) is an important step in preparing a wound for dressing application. Prepared dressings that contain maggots to débride the wound are available through Health Canada’s [Special Access Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/biologics-radiopharmaceuticals-genetic-therapies/activities/fact-sheets/questions-answers-regulation-medicinal-maggots-medicinal-leeches.html); they confine the maggots to the wound, while allowing them to breathe and enable wound drainage.​[[30]](#ZubirMZMHollowaySNoorNM.MaggotThera-7B7C14A4)​[[31]](#Parnxe9sALaganKM.LarvalTherapyInWou-70E444B2) See Pressure Ulcers for more information on débridement.

Patient comfort and preference as well as the anatomical location of the wound will affect the choice of dressing. Factors to consider related to the patient include their circulation, the health of their skin, and their nutritional and medical status. Dressing factors include availability, durability and cost.

There are various challenges in dressing wounds. Dressings themselves are not able to change the nature of the wound; thus, the appropriate dressing for the wound needs to be selected. Changing and/or removing a dressing can cause pain, which is an important factor when choosing the type of dressing and the adhesive that will be used to secure the dressing. Wounds change as they heal, and different types of dressings may be required at different stages of healing. Sometimes, a composite dressing, which combines 2 or more types of dressing, can be used as the wound heals. Wounds that are considered “motional” (e.g., neck) can be difficult to dress and movement may disrupt the dressing.​[[32]](#Dong-73AD2B31)​[[33]](#Kondej-73AD470E)

| Note: hydrophilic dressings such as sugar paste or cadexomer iodine exert an osmotic pull and may increase the pain |
| Odour, most often caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas Note: infected wounds should always be medically assessed, as systemic antibiotics may be required. | Ionic silver and framycetin sulfate reduce colonization. Povidone/iodine has antiseptic activity, but is quickly deactivated in the presence of pus; therefore, an iodine cadexomer dressing may be preferred since it allows for a slower release of antiseptic, extending the antiseptic activity | Flamazine, Sofra-tulle, Iodosorb |
| Excessive exudate requiring a balance between the need for a moist environment and prevention of maceration | Foam and hydrocolloid dressings are good choices to absorb exudate Some types of wounds (e.g., venous ulcers) and wounds in patients with certain medical conditions (e.g., hypertension coupled with venous disease) produce more exudate. In these situations, compression bandages may also be useful to help reduce exudate by decreasing venous pressure and controlling edema | Allevyn, Duoderm CGF, Comfeel Plus, Tegaderm |
| Bleeding that needs to be controlled | Alginates have hemostatic properties | Algisite, Kaltostat |
| Infection secondary to a wound that may need to be treated with antibiotics | A dressing may be needed for the primary wound; antiseptic or antimicrobial dressings may be useful; however, they should not be used without concomitant systemic or topical antibiotic therapy | Actilite, Bactigras, Sofra-tulle |
| Fragile skin or skin tears | Silicone-based dressings, which do not stick to the wound surface, cause less epidermal trauma and pain upon removal and do not leave residue on the skin | Biatain Silicone, Mepilex Border Lite, Tegaderm Silicone |

### Considerations when Applying a Dressing

Proper use and application of any dressing are essential for maximum effectiveness; [Table 4](#psc1074n00015) describes the steps in applying a dressing.

The most commonly used dressings are self-adhesive bandages. Their application is straightforward; however, care must be taken to ensure the gauze pad is not contaminated through handling.

Principles of optimal use of dressings include the following:

- Use the correct size. A dressing should be large enough to cover the wound, yet not so large that it “bunches.” If ≥2 dressings are needed to cover the wound, the edges should be overlapped to ensure complete wound coverage.
- Use sterile technique to apply the dressing with clean hands or gloves. The dressing surface and wound itself should not be touched.
- Whatever is applied to the wound will eventually have to be removed. Greasy substances are best avoided as they may be difficult to remove, causing more damage to the wound. Lint from loosely woven gauze can also be problematic.
- The wound must be cleaned prior to applying any dressing. Applying a dressing to a contaminated wound increases the risk of infection. Flushing the wound with clean water or sterile saline may be sufficient.
- If a wound requires débridement or control of bleeding, it should be performed before a dressing is applied, unless the dressing is specifically designed for débridement or the control of bleeding. If extensive débridement is needed or if bleeding is excessive, a health-care professional should be consulted.
- Sutures may be needed; dressings, even butterfly closures, do not replace necessary sutures.
- Always consider potential complications such as excessive bleeding and infection. Possible signs of infection include pain, swelling, heat at wound or surrounding tissue, pus, colour changes (pink to red in lightly pigmented skin and grey/purple/brown/black in darkly pigmented skin), odour, and fever. A malodorous wound is usually infected.
- Remember that some patients have a higher risk of complications. Individuals with diabetes have impaired circulation and wound-healing ability. Nutritional deficiencies may delay healing, and the use of some medications (e.g., anticoagulants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) may increase the risk of bleeding or delay healing. Patients with fragile skin (e.g., older individuals) have an increased risk of skin damage with dressing application and removal.
- Dressings require changing at different intervals. It is a misconception that once a dressing is applied, there is no need to change it. Wear time is the duration of time that a dressing can be remain on the wound before a change of dressing is needed; it determines the number of changes required and, if overextended, can impair healing. Manufacturer instructions and wound care protocols inform whether a dressing requires changing and the recommended interval. Most dressings require changing if they become soiled, malodorous or if blood has oozed through.
- Most dressings have expiry dates and should not be used past these dates. The dressings themselves, any medications contained within the dressing and the adhesive have the potential to deteriorate over time.
- Monitoring of wound dressings is always recommended as it will reveal how the wound is healing and if complications such as infections have occurred; for more information, see [Monitoring](#Monitoring).

**Table 4:** Application of a Dressing​​[[a]](#afn90158)

| Assess patient’s risk factors : if the patient is at high risk of chronic wounds, assess if any risk factors can be mitigated. For examples, if the person has diabetes, assess blood glucose levels and, if needed, adjust blood glucose-lowering medications with the goal of increasing time in target range. Choose dressing : the choice may depend upon patient preference, wound type and cost (see Choice of Dressings ); expiry dates and manufacturer’s instructions should always be checked. Wash hands and work in a clean area : wearing gloves is an option; the work surface (e.g., table or countertop) may need to be cleaned with a disinfectant. Assess wound : if the wound is deep, bleeding excessively, extensive or is the result of a puncture, seek medical attention. Control bleeding : allow the wound to bleed slightly, then apply gentle pressure to stop the bleeding. Do not apply pressure to a puncture wound to avoid pushing the puncturing object further into the wound. Removal of an object, especially in a puncture wound, requires medical attention. Clean wound : remove large foreign particles, débride if necessary by flushing with sterile saline or clean water, and wash with soap and water. However, if more complex débridement is needed, seek medical attention. Check for symptoms of infection : watch for pain, swelling, heat at wound or surrounding tissue, pus, colour changes (pink/red in lightly pigmented skin and grey/purple/brown/black in darkly pigmented skin), odour and fever; if present, seek medical attention. Apply dressing : cover the wound with a dry, sterile dressing using commercially available materials whenever possible; ensure the dressing extends beyond the edges of the wound; use a bandage and adhesive tape if required to secure the dressing and do not impede circulation by bandaging the wound too tightly. Ensure that the dressing fits well, doesn’t “bunch” and is snug enough to prevent it from falling off. Monitor dressing : frequent verification of the wound is essential to determine how it is healing and if complications such as infections have occurred; for more information, see Monitoring . |

### Monitoring

Monitoring of wound dressings is always recommended as it will reveal how the wound is healing and if complications such as infections have occurred. It often prompts necessary dressing changes. For more information, see [Table 5](#MonitoringTable).

**Table 5:** Monitoring of Wounds Protected by Dressings

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bleeding | Monitor bleeding: should stop within 10 min ( 15 min if on anticoagulants). | Bleeding significantly slows or stops within 10-15 min of direct pressure. | Patient requires emergency medical treatment if blood is spurting or significant bleeding persists after 10 min of direct pressure ( 15 min if on anticoagulants). |
| Healing of wound | Monitor during dressing changes; frequency varies based on the type of dressing used. | Normally, healing wounds appear pink or red with tiny opalescent islands of epithelium throughout and no drainage. | If the wound (and wound edge) does not appear to become smaller or continues to “weep,” discharges pus or remains raw/red with each assessment or dressing change, further assessment is required. |
| Infection | Monitor daily for pain, swelling, heat at wound or surrounding tissue, pus, colour changes (pink to red in lightly pigmented skin and grey/purple/brown/black in darkly pigmented skin), odour, fever. | No signs or symptoms of infection present during wound healing. | Assess for further treatment if signs and symptoms of infection are present during or after wound healing. |
| Pain | Monitor before, during and after dressing changes and at least daily. | Minimal/none. | Assess for further treatment if signs and symptoms of pain are present during or after wound healing. Pain management may be required, especially during dressing changes; see Acute Pain for more information. |
