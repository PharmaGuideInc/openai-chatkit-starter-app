CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “male” and “female” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be broadly described as relating to storage dysfunction or voiding dysfunction. In Canada, 29% of older females and 5% of older males report LUTS.​[[1]](#Herschorn2008) Urinary incontinence (UI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine.​[[2]](#c0051n00028) The most common types of UI are stress, urgency, overflow and functional. Differentiating the type of incontinence is necessary, as each has a unique treatment approach.

Stress incontinence is the most common form of incontinence reported in Canada, accounting for 55.3% of UI.​[[3]](#Shaw2020) In female patients, it is a result of weakened pelvic floor muscles—reduced pelvic floor muscle strength causes urethral and bladder-neck mobility, resulting in urethral sphincter incompetence. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., “stress” from laughing, coughing, exercise, abdominal obesity) increases pressure inside the bladder that overcomes the ability of the compromised urethral sphincter to close the urethra, and urine leakage results. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency is a less common form of stress incontinence and may result from pelvic or other bladder surgery or irradiation, a vaginal birth or a neurological disorder.

Urgency incontinence is reported in 22.4% of Canadian adults​[[3]](#Shaw2020) and usually involves leakage of moderate to large amounts of urine due to inability to delay voiding when an urge is perceived. Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome that often leads to urgency incontinence, although some individuals with OAB experience only an urgency to void and can toilet quickly enough to avoid incontinence. Causes of urgency incontinence include detrusor (bladder wall muscle) hyperactivity or instability and CNS disorders (e.g., parkinsonism, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis).

Mixed incontinence includes features of both stress and urgency incontinence and is reported in 17.3% of adults in Canada.​[[3]](#Shaw2020)

Overflow incontinence occurs when there is leakage of urine due to a distended bladder, commonly referred to as chronic retention of urine. This can occur due to detrusor underactivity (“underactive bladder”), which can include neurogenic bladder (disorder or problem with the nerve control of continence and voiding function, e.g., as a result of diabetes or stroke), or bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia). Overflow incontinence most commonly occurs in males and results in dribbling, hesitancy and poor urine flow. Between 10–41% of males ≥40 years of age report having severe LUTS due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).​[[4]](#Logie2005)

Functional incontinence is the loss of urine caused by the inability to mobilize to or use the toilet and does not involve changes in the lower urinary tract. Causes include physical constraints (e.g., restricted mobility, difficulty removing clothing), cognitive factors (e.g., depression, neurocognitive disorder [dementia]) and environmental barriers (e.g., access to toilet, positioning). Treatment focuses on optimizing the underlying condition or functional status and does not involve intervention for the urinary tract. As such, it is beyond the scope of this content and is not addressed.

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve urinary symptoms
- Prevent complications (e.g., depression, falls, skin breakdown, urinary tract infections)
- Improve quality of life
- Avoid treatment side effects
- Improve bladder function

### Investigations

There are a number of validated tools consisting of a series of questions that can be used to facilitate diagnosis of incontinence. One of the most common, the 3IQ (incontinence questionnaire), was designed to help family physicians identify urinary incontinence and distinguish between stress, urgency and mixed types.​[[5]](#c0051n00037) It consists of 3 questions and takes only about 30 seconds to complete:

1. During the last 3 months, have you leaked urine (even a small amount)? (Yes or no; if no, questionnaire completed)
2. During the last 3 months, did you leak urine (check all that apply):

   1. When you were performing some physical activity, such as coughing, sneezing, lifting or exercise?
   2. When you had the urge or feeling that you needed to empty your bladder, but you could not get to the toilet fast enough?
   3. Without physical activity and without a sense of urgency?
3. During the last 3 months, did you leak urine most often (check only one):

   1. When you were performing some physical activity, such as coughing, sneezing, lifting or exercise? (Stress only or stress predominant incontinence)
   2. When you had the urge or feeling that you needed to empty your bladder, but you could not get to the toilet fast enough? (Urgency only or urgency-predominant incontinence)
   3. Without physical activity and without a sense of urgency? (Other cause only or other cause predominant)
   4. About equally as often with physical activity as with a sense of urgency? (Mixed incontinence)

Other screening questions have been used by experts and can be integrated into a clinician’s history and review for the patient. Some of these questions include:​[[5]](#c0051n00037)​[[6]](#c0051n00032)​[[7]](#c0051n00033)​[[8]](#c0051n00034)​[[9]](#c0051n00036)​[[10]](#Lukacz2017)​[[11]](#Brown2018)​[[12]](#Pearlman2020)

- In the past 3 months, have you leaked urine?
- How often do you leak urine?
- When do you leak urine?
- Do you ever leak urine when you cough, laugh, lift heavy objects or exercise?
- Do you ever leak urine on the way to the bathroom?
- Are you having problems holding your urine?
- Do you have difficulty getting to the toilet in time?
- Do you ever lose urine when you don't want to?
- Do you ever use pads, tissue or cloth in your underwear to catch urine?
- Do you have to strain to urinate?
- Do you ever feel that you are unable to completely empty your bladder?

Most people find urinary incontinence to be distressing but the extent of bother can be measured to determine the degree of distress and to establish a baseline, if needed. For example, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire ([ICIQ](https://iciq.net/)) has a series of validated questionnaires that are publicly available and can be selected based on sex, type of UI or other patient features. Other tools used in practice and research include the Bladder Self-Assessment Questionnaire (B-SAQ), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and Urogenital Distress Inventory.​[[13]](#Basra2007)​[[14]](#Uebersax1995)

If the patient does have urinary incontinence, review for modifiable risk factors (see [Table 1](#c0051n00003)) and proceed with further assessment including a thorough history with attention to:​[[10]](#Lukacz2017)​[[12]](#Pearlman2020)​[[16]](#c0051n00038)​[[17]](#refitem-1202110-2DEC4EFF)​[[18]](#Trowbridge2022)

- Urologic History:

  - characteristics of symptoms, e.g., onset, frequency and severity of symptoms
  - degree of bother of symptoms (impact on emotional well-being and daily function)
  - previous treatments for urinary symptoms, e.g., medical, mechanical (pessaries), surgical, containment products (including number of pads/products used per day)
  - bladder diary for 3 days to determine fluid intake, frequency, timing, and amount of voiding and urine leakage (recording for longer periods is challenging for patients and does not provide additional significant information for decision-making). A sample of a bladder diary can be found at the [Canadian Continence Foundation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65a5be5a40b6451450a341e1/t/65ea2b2e814ab72caa4b6ba7/1709845295476/Bladder-Diary.pdf)
- Medical History:

  - obstetrical history (including vaginal versus Cesarean deliveries, use of forceps)
  - menopausal status
  - possible causes such as diabetes, depression, mobility or cognitive impairment, previous bladder surgeries, or neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, stroke or spinal cord injury
  - bowel habits (e.g., history of constipation)
- Surgical History:

  - pelvic surgery (including prostate surgery)
- Medication History:

  - current prescription medications (e.g., loop diuretics, SGLT2 inhibitors), nonprescription medications (e.g., anticholinergics, antihistamines, decongestants) and natural health products
  - recent medication changes (new medications started or medications discontinued)
- Lifestyle Factors:

  - diet
  - fluid intake and history (volume, type—notably caffeinated products)
  - alcohol intake
  - smoking history
- Physical Examination:

  - review of systems (generally recommended with a full bladder)
  - neurologic

    - mental status, cognition
    - evidence of central or peripheral neurologic disease
  - pelvic examination (to assess tone and to rule out pelvic masses, organ prolapse, latent stress incontinence, urogenital atrophy)
  - rectal examination (tone, masses, impaction)
  - physical impairment (dexterity, mobility, vision–indicating interference with function)
- Investigations:

  - cough test (if immediate leakage, likely stress incontinence; if delayed leakage, likely urgency incontinence)
  - urinalysis (to rule out infection, glucosuria, hematuria)
  - post-void residual volume (PVR; <50 mL is normal; intervention may be necessary at 100–150 mL)
  - renal function tests (urea, serum creatinine, glucose, calcium) if renal dysfunction suspected or polyuria present
  - urodynamic testing may be accessed through specialist referral (e.g., urology, geriatrics) to measure detrusor compliance and contractility, PVR and bladder capacity

| Caffeine intake Fluid intake (1.5–2 L/day is considered appropriate) Limited physical activity Restricted mobility/environmental challenges (includes dexterity in clothing removal, accessibility to toilets) Smoking Chronic or acute medical conditions: Benign prostatic hyperplasia Bowel problems (constipation, fecal impaction) Diabetes (if poorly controlled) Lower urinary tract conditions (urinary tract infection, urogenital atrophy) Obesity (notably abdominal) Obstructive sleep apnea Medications: Stress UI may be worsened by alpha-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., terazosin), diuretics (e.g., furosemide), corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), sympatholytics (e.g., clonidine) Urgency UI may be worsened by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil), bladder irritants (e.g., ketamine) Overflow UI may be worsened by alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., phenylephrine), anticholinergics (e.g., dimenhydrinate) and some calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem) |

### Stress Incontinence

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0051n00023) outlines the management of urinary incontinence in adults and [Table 2](#c0051n00052) details the medications available for the treatment of stress incontinence in females.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions are first line for stress incontinence after secondary causes have been ruled out or treated.​[[16]](#c0051n00038)​[[20]](#Qaseem2014)​[[21]](#c0051n00231) Most evidence with stress incontinence is from studies in females although there is some research in males who have had pelvic surgery.​[[12]](#Pearlman2020)

- Pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME, previously known as Kegel exercises), a self-guided pelvic floor exercise program: 12–20 muscle contractions 3–5 times per day (goal of 10 seconds for each contraction); may take 6–8 weeks to see results.​[[22]](#c0051n00186)​[[23]](#refitem-1202117-2F7E8AC6)​[[24]](#c0051n00273)​[[25]](#BascurCastillo2022)​[[26]](#Woodley2021)

  - Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), also known as pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT), involves a patient being assessed and trained by a professional specializing in this area, such as a physiotherapist specializing in pelvic floor disorders.
  - In males, evidence-based guidelines recommend PFME or PFMT prior to resection of the prostate and in the immediate postoperative period.​[[27]](#Sandhu2019)​[[28]](#Xiangyun2022)
- Biofeedback and/or electrical stimulation therapy: stimulation that teaches the patient to isolate and control pelvic floor muscles.​[[10]](#Lukacz2017)​[[25]](#BascurCastillo2022)​[[29]](#StewartCochrane2017)​[[30]](#Alouini2022)
- Weight loss may help in patients who are overweight or obese.​[[31]](#Doumouchtsis2022)​[[32]](#Wu2021)
- Vaginal devices: in some patients with vaginal prolapse, a pessary (a prosthetic device inserted into the vagina to support its internal structure) may be appropriate.​[[33]](#ONHealth2021)​[[34]](#Harvey2021) Single-use products, designed to be inserted like a tampon, are also available and may be suitable for some patients.​[[32]](#Wu2021) Weighted vaginal cones have less evidence but are also an option and may produce results similar to PFME.​[[35]](#Herbison2013)
- Surgical options depend on the etiology. In females, the most common intervention is a midurethral mesh sling (including retropubic, transobturator and the less-effective single-incision).​[[32]](#Wu2021)​[[36]](#Caldwell2021) These are well-established and safe procedures; however, a warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) addressing the use of transvaginal mesh for repair of pelvic organ prolapse (as compared with transvaginal native tissue repair) concluded mesh does not have a favourable risk-benefit profile in these patients.​[[37]](#FDAMesh) Although sling procedures are most commonly used in females, they may be considered in males who have undergone prostatectomy after other non-invasive interventions have been trialled.​[[27]](#Sandhu2019)​[[38]](#Shelton2020) An alternative surgical option involves injecting bulking agents such as collagen or synthetic gel around the urethra to improve sphincter function. This procedure is less effective and benefits can decline dramatically over 6 months.​[[36]](#Caldwell2021)​[[39]](#Hoe2021)​[[40]](#Hillary2020)​[[41]](#Matsuoka2015)​[[42]](#c0051n00234) As a last line, retropubic suspension may be considered for some patients.​[[36]](#Caldwell2021)​[[43]](#refitem-1202127-2F88578C)

### Pharmacologic Choices

The drugs used in the management of stress incontinence in females are detailed in [Table 2](#c0051n00052).

Vaginal estrogen therapy has been studied but the overall supporting evidence is weak and the benefit is not clinically significant.​[[44]](#Balk2019) However, vaginal estrogen therapy may be considered in select cases if the postmenopausal patient is diagnosed with mixed urinary incontinence and vaginal atrophy.​[[45]](#NICE2019) Vaginal estrogen may also be used in patients prescribed pessaries to strengthen the vagina to improve stability and comfort.​[[45]](#NICE2019)​[[46]](#Alperin2019) There is no need for a progestogen with the use of vaginal estrogen therapy. Systemic estrogen therapy (transdermal or oral administration) does not offer benefits and may worsen symptoms of UI.​[[46]](#Alperin2019)​[[47]](#RahkolaSoisalo2019)​[[48]](#c0051n00235) See Menopause for detailed information on estrogen therapy.

Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is indicated in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety and pain but was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for stress UI. There is evidence that duloxetine decreases the rate of UI and improves quality-of-life scores​[[49]](#c0051n00251)​[[50]](#refitem-1202136-30050B0F) and there is evidence that patients who have prostate surgery may also benefit from duloxetine.​[[51]](#Park2022)​[[52]](#Kotecha2021) In studies of patients with depression, duloxetine was associated with an increased risk of suicide; it is unclear whether this risk applies to patients without depression. A meta-analysis of data submitted to the EMA found the effect sizes of benefits were small and did not outweigh the potential risks, consistent with other evidence showing frequent discontinuation due to side effects.​[[52]](#Kotecha2021)​[[53]](#Maund2017) However, the NICE guidelines from the UK support offering duloxetine to females with stress UI if surgical treatment is not appropriate, emphasizing that patients must be counselled about adverse effects prior to starting therapy.​[[45]](#NICE2019)

### Urgency Incontinence

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0051n00023) outlines the management of urinary incontinence in adults and [Table 3](#c0051n00054) details the medications available for the treatment of urgency incontinence.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

When secondary causes have been ruled out or treated, initiate conservative management/behavioural therapy:​[[16]](#c0051n00038)​[[20]](#Qaseem2014)​[[21]](#c0051n00231)​[[56]](#Corcos2017)​[[57]](#Russo2021)

- Bladder training (timed voiding): consists of maintaining a voiding schedule that is gradually increased to a reasonable interval with minimal incontinence episodes, e.g., 1-hour voiding intervals that are increased weekly until voiding every 2–3 hours with minimal incontinence.​[[20]](#Qaseem2014)​[[44]](#Balk2019)​[[58]](#c0051n00177)​[[59]](#NICE2015qs77)​[[60]](#Nitti2021) Bladder training is non-invasive and has been found more effective than antimuscarinic therapy.​[[44]](#Balk2019)
- Pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME): although primarily prescribed for stress UI, PFME may also benefit urgency UI.​[[61]](#c0051n00188)​[[62]](#Roberts2021)​[[63]](#Irwin2019) PFME consists of performing 12–20 muscle contractions, held for 10 seconds each, 3–5 times per day; it may take 6–8 weeks to see results.
- Weight loss: there is evidence that weight loss in females who are overweight or obese results in reductions in nocturia, urgency, and stress UI; however, sustaining weight loss long term is a challenge.​[[64]](#Yazdany2020)​[[65]](#Breyer2018)
- Smoking cessation: observational data indicate that abstaining from cigarettes leads to less urinary frequency.​[[66]](#ICI-7-2023)
- Caffeine reduction: there is evidence that caffeine reduction (in some cases without cessation) leads to reduced urgency episodes and nocturnal enuresis.​[[67]](#LeBerre2020)
- Fluid restriction: although patients may choose to restrict fluid with the intent of reducing urine, there is a risk that concentrated urine may contribute to bladder irritation and urgency. A recommendation to reduce daytime fluid intake by 25% comes from one study that found this improved daytime frequency, urgency and nocturia;​[[68]](#Hashim2008) however, fluid restriction may be associated with increased constipation.​[[69]](#Swithinbank2005)
- Biofeedback training: involves stimulation that teaches the patient to isolate and control pelvic floor muscles.​[[44]](#Balk2019)​[[63]](#Irwin2019) Electrical stimulation may be effective with a protocol using tibial neurostimulation.​[[70]](#Zomkowski2022) Generally neuromodulation is accepted as a third-line approach for refractory urgency incontinence.​[[18]](#Trowbridge2022)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drugs used in the management of urgency incontinence are detailed in [Table 3](#c0051n00054).

Antimuscarinics (darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium) are considered second-line treatment for urgency incontinence when nonpharmacologic options fail to provide adequate symptomatic relief.​[[56]](#Corcos2017) These medications have been shown to provide short-term improvement in OAB symptoms and enhance quality of life.​[[71]](#c0051n00239)​[[72]](#Reynolds2015)​[[73]](#Khullar2006) However, the medications are not curative and the benefit for patients may not be acceptable given the side effects.​[[74]](#Herbison2019) They can be combined with nonpharmacologic therapies for added benefit.​[[71]](#c0051n00239)​[[75]](#c0051n00257) Antimuscarinic therapy should be continued for at least 4–8 weeks to determine benefit.​[[63]](#Irwin2019) Discontinuing therapy should be considered at the 8-week point if there is no benefit or if the side effects are not tolerable for the patient.

Anticholinergic effects can occur with antimuscarinic products; they are of greater concern in older adults and often lead to early discontinuation of therapy.​[[76]](#Vouri2017)​[[77]](#Veenboer2014)​[[78]](#Rutman2021) To minimize side effects, start at a low dose and titrate slowly. Vigilant monitoring is required when using antimuscarinic medications in older adults since these patients are more susceptible to their adverse effects. More selective agents (darifenacin, solifenacin, trospium) demonstrate reduced side effects compared with traditional anticholinergic therapy and may improve adherence.​[[79]](#c0051n00325)​[[80]](#c0051n00329)

Safety concerns were initially thought to be reversible with medication discontinuation; however, increased risk of dementia as a result of cumulative anticholinergic effects has led to debate about the use of antimuscarinics, particularly in older adults.​[[62]](#Roberts2021)​[[81]](#Matta2022)​[[82]](#Coupland2019)​[[83]](#Araklitis2017)

Systemic **estrogens** do not have a place in therapy in the treatment of postmenopausal urgency incontinence and may actually worsen incontinence.​[[48]](#c0051n00235)​[[57]](#Russo2021) Vaginal estrogen for females with postmenopausal urogenital atrophy may be an option as an adjunct to behavioural or pharmacologic treatment (see [Table 2](#c0051n00052)).​[[45]](#NICE2019)​[[84]](#refitem-1202132-2F88BC29)​[[85]](#Robinson2014)

Mirabegron is a beta3-adrenergic agonist indicated for the treatment of urgency incontinence. Mirabegron has been studied in both males and females and, compared with placebo, is effective in reducing the number of urgency incontinence episodes by about 1/day.​[[86]](#c0051n00332)​[[87]](#c0051n00333)​[[88]](#c0051n00334)​[[89]](#Athanasiou2020)​[[90]](#Mullen2021) Mirabegron is better tolerated than antimuscarinic therapy and may result in improved adherence.​[[91]](#Wagg2016) This may be the reason some experts recommend mirabegron prior to antimuscarinic therapy, particularly in frail, older adults or those with cognitive impairment, although further research is required.​[[92]](#Makhani2020)​[[93]](#Fogaing2020)​[[94]](#Sahai2021)

Intravesicular **botulinum toxin (**onabotulinumtoxinA**)** is approved for use in Canada for refractory overactive bladder and in neurogenic detrusor overactivity (e.g,. spinal cord injury). Botulinum toxin (BTXA) is administered via cystoscopy, which is invasive and performed in hospital or specialized clinics. BTXA decreases urgency incontinence and has demonstrated improvement in quality of life and reduced frequency of incontinence episodes.​[[95]](#c0051n00337)​[[96]](#Chapple2013)​[[97]](#Jo2018) BTXA has evidence showing consistent benefits over 3 years of follow-up.​[[98]](#Nitti2016) The most common complication is UTI; patients also report dysuria and there is a risk for urinary retention.​[[56]](#Corcos2017)

### Mixed Incontinence

### Therapeutic Choices

Treat patients with mixed UI for the predominant symptom (e.g., stress or urgency symptoms).​[[62]](#Roberts2021)​[[63]](#Irwin2019)​[[99]](#EAU2022)​[[100]](#Nygaard2019)

### Overflow Incontinence

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- The approach to treatment for overflow UI should address the underlying condition causing the chronic retention of urine. Chronic retention of urine due to a noncontractile bladder may be due to detrusor underactivity or bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., BPH). ​[[101]](#Kavanagh2019)
- The first-line approach consists of addressing reversible causes of overflow UI such as medications that cause urinary retention (e.g., anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, sympathomimetics).​[[63]](#Irwin2019)
- Chronic underactivity can be treated with catheterization (intermittent, indwelling, suprapubic).​[[62]](#Roberts2021)
- For patients with overflow UI as a result of BPH, medical or surgical interventions may be appropriate​[[102]](#c0051n00341) (see Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Chronic retention of urine due to detrusor underactivity is poorly responsive to pharmacologic therapy. A systematic review found inconsistent evidence for parasympathomimetics for urinary retention but overall very poor tolerance due to GI upset, blurred vision, bronchospasm and bradycardia.​[[103]](#Barendrecht2007) Other medications that can be tried include alpha-adrenergic antagonists and prostaglandins.​[[99]](#EAU2022) For management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, see Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Urinary Incontinence during Pregnancy

Urinary incontinence before pregnancy is extremely rare; the peripartum period is when patients tend to experience UI for the first time.​[[104]](#Moosdorff2021) Stress UI is the most common type during pregnancy (63%), and this is associated with an increased risk of experiencing stress UI after pregnancy.​[[104]](#Moosdorff2021) Urgency and frequency increase from the first to third trimester,​[[104]](#Moosdorff2021)​[[105]](#Swanton2020) with reported rates of incontinence up to 74% by week 36.​[[106]](#Sangsawang2013)​[[107]](#c0051n00353) Stress incontinence is believed to develop in pregnancy as the result of a combination of physiological changes, such as hormonal changes and weight gain by the pregnant patient, uterus and fetus, which results in reduced strength of the pelvic floor muscles and increased pressure on the bladder.​[[106]](#Sangsawang2013)​[[108]](#c0051n00357) Risk factors associated with urinary incontinence during pregnancy include advanced maternal age and higher BMI.​[[105]](#Swanton2020)​[[109]](#Wuytack2022)

Many patients report a resolution of urinary symptoms after delivery. However, pregnancy increases the prevalence of long-term stress incontinence and nocturia, especially in those who have had >1 child.​[[104]](#Moosdorff2021) The hypothesized mechanism is damage to the urinary tract, pelvic floor musculature or nervous system from the birth. Episiotomy, operative vaginal delivery, exposure to oxytocin in labour or vaginal delivery of an infant weighing >4 kg increase the risk of subsequent pelvic floor dysfunction.​[[110]](#c0051n00348)​[[111]](#c0051n00355)

### Management

The emphasis in pregnancy is on preventative measures, with PFMT found to be effective when implemented during pregnancy.​[[105]](#Swanton2020)​[[106]](#Sangsawang2013)​[[112]](#Morkved2014) Interventions to reduce time in labour and device-assisted delivery (e.g., use of forceps), avoid episiotomy, or consider Cesarean section may reduce the risk of subsequent UI, but the evidence is scant.​[[105]](#Swanton2020)​[[113]](#Siahkal2020)​[[114]](#Rantell2018)

Treatment of urinary incontinence during pregnancy involves pelvic floor rehabilitation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that incontinence could be prevented by starting pelvic floor muscle strengthening during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period. Patients may be referred to a physiotherapist or participate in a home-based exercise program.​[[106]](#Sangsawang2013)​[[112]](#Morkved2014)​[[115]](#c0051n00364)​[[116]](#Meekins2020)​[[117]](#Schreiner2018)

### Urinary Incontinence during Breastfeeding

Many patients will have resolution of urinary symptoms postdelivery. However, if pelvic floor injury occurs, symptoms may persist. While disruptive for the patient, this condition does not significantly impact the nursing child. Fluid restriction has been studied and there may be improvements with reducing daytime fluid intake 25%, but this has not been studied in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding,​[[68]](#Hashim2008) and reducing fluid intake could negatively impact milk production.

### Management

The recommendations for management of postpartum urinary incontinence primarily focus on pelvic floor rehabilitation.​[[26]](#Woodley2021)​[[105]](#Swanton2020)​[[106]](#Sangsawang2013)​[[112]](#Morkved2014)​[[115]](#c0051n00364)​[[116]](#Meekins2020)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Provide patient education regarding management alternatives (risks, benefits), determine patient expectations and involve the patient in the decision-making process.
- Pharmacologic interventions provide symptomatic benefit but are not curative.
- Treat all secondary causes (e.g., UTI, constipation, lifestyle factors, medications or poor mobility) either before or concurrently with other management strategies.
- Ensure baseline frequency, urgency or other symptoms are documented in order to assess for improvement.
- Ensure baseline cognition is assessed in older adults to monitor for cognitive impairment.
- Most nonpharmacologic interventions require 6–12 weeks for benefit; pharmacologic interventions take several weeks to achieve maximum effect.
- As initial therapy, recommend the strategy that is the least invasive, is reversible and has the fewest side effects.
- For stress UI, first-line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training; pharmacologic therapy is used as adjunct therapy or for refractory cases.
- For urgency UI, bladder training is first-line treatment. Consider pharmacologic options if bladder training is unsuccessful.
- Containment products designed for UI are distinct from menstrual products and cannot be substituted. The placement of the absorbent core, the absorbency and the odour prevention make these products unique. Ensure the patient is using the correct type of containment product for their anatomy and for the type of UI.
- Be aware of challenges with persistence and adherence that can occur with both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments.

There is no evidence of endometrial proliferation with vaginal estrogen; in general, concomitant progestogen therapy or endometrial surveillance is not recommended in asymptomatic (non-bleeding) females.​ [19] Adjust dosage and frequency of application as needed. See Menopause . |
| estrone, vaginal cream 0.1% Estragyn Vaginal Cream $25–50 | 0.5–4 g daily PV cyclic regimen (21 days on, 7 days off) or 2–3 × weekly PV continuous regimen | Local burning, irritation, vaginal leakage. | Systemic absorption variable; no serious interactions reported. | Can be used for stress UI , urgency UI or mixed UI if vaginal atrophy. There is no evidence of endometrial proliferation with vaginal estrogen; in general, concomitant progestogen therapy or endometrial surveillance is not recommended in asymptomatic (non-bleeding) females.​ [19] Adjust dosage and frequency of application as needed. See Menopause . |

**Drug Class: Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors**

| duloxetine Cymbalta , generics $25–50 | 60 mg daily PO A starting dose of 30 mg daily PO × 1–2 wk may be considered for tolerability reasons in some patients, with a target dose of 60 mg/day | Tachycardia, increased blood pressure, palpitations; nausea, dry mouth, constipation, erectile dysfunction, flushing. | Substrate and inhibitor of CYP2D6. Contraindicated with MAO inhibitors (increased risk of serotonin syndrome). CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors may decrease metabolism of duloxetine. CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 inducers may increase the metabolism of duloxetine. | Duloxetine is not approved for treatment of stress UI in Canada. The doses available, 30 mg and 60 mg, are not consistent with the studied doses of 80 mg once daily or 40 mg twice daily. Duloxetine is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis) or in severe renal impairment (estimated ClCr <30 mL/min). |

**Table 3:** Drug Therapy for Urgency Incontinence

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Anticholinergics**

| darifenacin, extended-release Enablex , generics <$25 | 7.5 mg daily PO After 2 wk, may increase to 15 mg daily PO if necessary | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. Do not exceed 7.5 mg daily when used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Caution with other substrates of CYP2D6 that have narrow therapeutic indices as their clearance may be decreased. | Avoid in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There are no special dosing requirements for patients with renal impairment. |
| fesoterodine fumarate extended-release Toviaz , generics $25–50 | 4 mg daily PO May increase to 8 mg daily PO if needed Limit dose to 4 mg daily if ClCr <30 mL/min | Back pain, constipation, cough, dry eyes, dry mouth. | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. Do not exceed 4 mg daily when used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the concentration of the active metabolite of fesoterodine. CYP3A4 inducers reduce the concentration of the active metabolite of fesoterodine; concomitant use is not recommended. | Should not be crushed or chewed. Avoid in patients with severe hepatic impairment. |
| oxybutynin, immediate-release generics <$25 | 2.5–5 mg daily–QID PO | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. | Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. In older adults, prescribe the lowest recommended starting dose. |
| solifenacin Vesicare , generics <$25 | 5 mg daily PO May increase to 10 mg daily PO if tolerated | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. Do not exceed 5 mg daily with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. | Avoid in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Do not exceed 5 mg daily in severe renal impairment (ClCr <30 mL/min). |
| tolterodine, immediate-release Detrol , generics <$25 | 1–2 mg BID PO | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. CYP3A4 metabolism becomes significant in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers; maximum dose of 2 mg/day in all patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. | In older adults and those with severe renal impairment, prescribe the lowest recommended starting dose. |
| tolterodine, extended-release Detrol LA , generics $25–50 | 2–4 mg once daily PO | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. CYP3A4 metabolism becomes significant in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers; maximum dose of 2 mg/day in all patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Coadministration of Detrol LA with antacid results in increased C max of tolterodine and the potential for “dose-dumping.” Tolterodine extended-release products may also be affected by PPI treatment.​ [54] ​ [55] | In older adults and those with severe renal impairment, prescribe the lowest recommended starting dose. |
| trospium Trosec , generics $25–50 | 20 mg BID on an empty stomach In older patients or those with severe renal impairment, do not exceed 20 mg QHS | Primarily anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, delirium, increased intraocular pressure and worsening glaucoma, dry eyes, tachycardia). | Potential additive effects with other anticholinergic drugs. | Although it has been suggested that trospium may produce less central nervous system side effects than other anticholinergics, this advantage has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. |

**Drug Class: Beta3-adrenergic agonists**

| mirabegron, extended-release Myrbetriq $25–50 | 25–50 mg once daily PO Not to exceed 25 mg once daily PO in patients with severe renal impairment, moderate hepatic impairment or taking drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 and with a narrow therapeutic index | Hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, headache, tachycardia, QT c prolongation (rare). | Moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and weak inhibitor of P–glycoprotein. May increase level of substrates of CYP2D6 and P–glycoprotein. Coadministration with antimuscarinic agents may increase risk of urinary retention. | Should not be crushed or chewed. Should not be used in severe uncontrolled hypertension. |
