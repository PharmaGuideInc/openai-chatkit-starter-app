### Pathophysiology

Constipation is generally defined as defecation fewer than 3 times per week accompanied by other symptoms including hard stools; feeling of incomplete evacuation; excessive straining; a sense of rectal blockage; and abdominal discomfort, bloating and distention.​[[1]](#psc1031n1001) Some patients incorrectly believe that a daily bowel movement is necessary and that anything less means they are constipated. In fact, the average number of bowel movements for adults and children 3 years of age and older in the Western world varies from 3 daily to 1 every 3 days.​[[2]](#psc1031n1002)​[[3]](#psc1031n1003)

Constipation occurring chronically that does not have drug, anatomic or physiologic causes is termed functional or chronic idiopathic constipation and is defined by the ROME IV criteria (see [Table 1](#psc1031n00008)).​[[5]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed20160-9A203EE7)​[[6]](#psc1031n1004) Constipation can also be a symptom secondary to a drug or disease (see [Table 2](#psc1031n00011)).​[[5]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed20160-9A203EE7)​[[7]](#psc1031n1007)​[[8]](#psc1031n1008)​[[9]](#psc1031n1009) If left untreated, chronic constipation may lead to serious complications such as obstruction, fecal impaction, anal fissures, hemorrhoids, megacolon, pelvic organ prolapse in women and volvulus.​[[10]](#psc1031n1005)​[[11]](#psc1031n1006)​[[12]](#psc1031n01194)

**Table 1:** ROME IV Diagnostic Criteria for Chronic Functional Constipation​[[4]](#refitem-127219-9F0A6C67)

| Must include 2 or more of the following symptoms for at least 3 months, with an onset of at least 6 months prior to diagnosis: Straining during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations Lumpy or hard stools (Bristol Stool Form Scale 1–2) more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations Sensation of incomplete evacuation more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations Manual maneuvers to facilitate more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor) Fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome |

The Rome IV criteria newly defines opioid-induced constipation, classifying the condition as new or worsening constipation when either initiating, changing or increasing opioid therapy; it must include 2 or more of the Rome IV criteria for constipation, including straining during more than 25% of defecations. Narcotic bowel syndrome or opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia is characterized by an increase in abdominal pain associated with continuous or increasing doses of opioids; this is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting and gastroesophageal reflux.​[[13]](#refitem-1272113-9F185D32)

There is growing evidence revealing a strong overlap between functional constipation (FC) and irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation (IBS-C).​[[14]](#refitem-1272114-9F194EF4) Future criteria may consider more of a diagnostic spectrum to distinguish between constipation disorders. Definitive diagnosis of IBS-C is confirmed with physiological testing, an abnormal balloon evacuation test, imaging and anal manometry. In the absence of these quantitative tests, it may be difficult to distinguish a distinct condition. Presenting symptoms of IBS-C may be bloating and/or pain, which are not key features of functional constipation.​[[15]](#refitem-1272115-9F1AAFD7) Painful constipation may be an identifying feature occurring, on average, 1 day per week over the past 3 months.

Fecal impaction is the inability to pass a hard collection of stool. Symptoms of impaction include rectal discomfort, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, urinary frequency, and both fecal and urinary overflow incontinence. Physically or mentally incapacitated persons and the elderly are at particular risk of impaction, as are those who require long-term use of medications associated with constipation (see [Table 2](#psc1031n00011)).

**Table 2:** Medications and Conditions Associated with Chronic Constipation

| Medications | Conditions |

| 5-HT3 receptor antagonists Ondansetron Anticholinergics Antidepressants Bupropion Mirtazapine Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Paroxetine Trazodone Tricyclic antidepressants Venlafaxine Antidiarrheal agents Diphenoxylate Loperamide Antiepileptics Gabapentin Phenytoin Pregabalin Antihistamines Diphenhydramine Hydroxyzine Antihypertensives Clonidine Nifedipine Verapamil Antinauseants Dimenhydrinate Prochlorperazine Promethazine Scopolamine | Antiparkinsonian agents Amantadine Benztropine Bromocriptine Levodopa Pramipexole Ropinirole Antiplatelets Clopidogrel Antipsychotics Clozapine Antispasmodics Dicyclomine Cation-containing agents Aluminum Barium Bismuth Calcium Iron Diuretics NSAIDs Opioids Resins Cholestyramine Sodium polystyrene sulfonate Vinca alkaloids | Anatomic obstructions Diverticulosis Post-surgical abnormalities Stricture Cancer Chemotherapy-induced dehydration Direct intestinal radiation Hormonal changes Hypercalcemia Tumor compression of large intestine Tumor interference with colonic innervations Dementia Endocrine/metabolic disorders Autonomic neuropathy Chronic renal failure/uremia Cystic fibrosis Diabetes GI motor disorders Hirschsprung disease Hyper/hypocalcemia Hyperparathyroidism Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Hypothyroidism Intestinal pseudo-obstruction Irritable bowel syndrome | Megarectum and megacolon Multiple sclerosis Neurogenic disorders Panhypopituitarism Parkinson disease Pelvic floor dysfunction Porphyria Rectoceles Spinal cord injury Stroke Systemic sclerosis Uremia Older age Pain Secondary to anal fissures, hemorrhoids Pregnancy Psychiatric disorders Abuse, anxiety, brain injury, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorder |

Risk factors for chronic or acute constipation include:​[[16]](#psc1031n1010)​[[17]](#psc1031n1011)​[[18]](#psc1031n1012)​[[19]](#psc1031n1013)

- Female gender
- Living in rural, northern or mountainous areas in North America​[[17]](#psc1031n1011)
- Over 65 years of age
- Fewer years of formal education
- Low caloric intake
- Greater number of medications used
- Lower socioeconomic status
- Physical and/or sexual abuse
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Travelling
- Toilet training (in children)
- Ignoring the urge to defecate (habituates the rectum to the stimulus of the fecal mass)

### Goals of Therapy

- Treat or correct the secondary cause of constipation
- Return frequency of stool to previous normal or at minimum ≥3 defecations per week
- Eliminate symptoms of straining, incomplete emptying, bloating, pain and obstruction
- Improve stool consistency
- Improve quality of life
- Avoid complications of constipation, i.e., hemorrhoids, anal fissure, rectal prolapse, fecal impaction and incontinence
- Treat fecal impaction or obstruction
- Use laxatives appropriately and avoid dependency

### Patient Assessment

A complete assessment of patient with constipation is necessary to delineate root causes (see [Figure 2](#AssessmentAndTreatmentOfPatientsWit-08D7AF43)).​[[20]](#psc1031n1014)​[[21]](#psc1031n1015) Examine diet, exercise and relevant social or psychological problems. In the initial patient assessment, review prescription and nonprescription medications to rule out drug-induced causes (see [Table 2](#psc1031n00011)). This review must also include natural health products since their overuse could cause gut dysfunction and paradoxical constipation.​[[21]](#psc1031n1015) Patient often has self-medicated prior to asking for assistance. Address the patient's most bothersome symptoms and inquire about past laxative use and failed therapies, to help maximize adherence and reduce possible side effects.​[[2]](#psc1031n1002) For patients with opioid-induced constipation, up to 28% afflicted do not take the prescribed laxatives, while 25% use laxatives only intermittently.​[[22]](#refitem-1272121-9F1BF5D9)

The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) is a tool to help patients describe bowel patterns in a way that is more useful for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment (see [Figure 1](#psc1031n01195)). In addition to the BSFS, pediatric patients can be assessed using the pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms-Rome III criteria (QPGS-RIII). Discrepencies may occur between scoring methods for stool consistency in pediatric patients, e.g., significantly more children 8–18 years of age reported harder stools using the BSFS versus the QPGS-RIII (18% vs 7.1%); however, the prevalence of functional constipation was similar.​[[23]](#refitem-1272123-9F1E4771)

Further assessment is required if constipation is accompanied by red flag symptoms (see [Table 3](#redflags)). After a thorough assessment, if red flag symptoms are absent and further investigation is not required, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy can be recommended for mild-moderate acute cases.

Signs and symptoms of constipation include:

- Infrequent defecation
- Abdominal distention
- Flatulence
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Anorexia
- Early satiety
- Stools that are small, hard and/or difficult to evacuate
- Incomplete rectal emptying
- Rectal bleeding due to fissures or hemorrhoids
- Weight loss (in chronic constipation)

Diagnostic colon motility tests (e.g., colonic transit studies, colon motility, colonic barostat testing) are usually reserved for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation who are unresponsive to regular laxative therapy.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004)​[[8]](#psc1031n1008)

**Figure 1:** Bristol Stool Form Scale​​[[a]](#afn84410)

![](images/constipationpsc_bristocha.gif)

[a] Types 1–2 indicate constipation, types 3–4 represent ideal stool consistencies as they are easier to pass and types 5–7 may indicate diarrhea and urgency.

​

**Table 3:** Red Flag Symptoms Requiring Further Assessment

| Children <2 years of age Constipation for >2 wk (or no bowel movement for >7 days) despite use of laxatives, particularly in the elderly and in those with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or Parkinson disease Blood or mucus in the stool or rectal bleeding, fever Symptoms suggestive of anemia such as fatigue or lethargy Family history of colon cancer (particularly if patient is >50 years of age) Persistent abdominal pain Vomiting Severe pain upon defecation Unremitting nocturnal symptoms Diarrhea alternating with constipation (could signify irritable bowel syndrome) Recent abdominal surgery Eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa Moderate to extreme thirst Unexplained weight loss of greater than 5% Chronic illness associated with constipation (see Table 2 ) Rectal or abdominal mass |

### Prevention

The following strategies may be used to prevent constipation:​[[24]](#psc1031n1016)

- Consume a high-fibre diet (should be complemented with a minimum fluid consumption of 1500 mL daily)
- Have a regular, private toilet routine
- Heed the urge to defecate
- Take a prophylactic laxative if using constipating medication or in presence of diseases associated with constipation
- Moderate daily physical activity may be helpful in mild constipation, particularly in the elderly. Vigorous exercise does not affect bowel habits in healthy subjects​[[25]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed12907-9A20BD00)
- Note that increasing the amount of fluid intake has been controversial unless patient usually drinks very little or is dehydrated​[[10]](#psc1031n1005)

Daily fibre intake of at least 25 g for adult females and 38 g for adult males younger than 50 years of age is currently recommended for increased laxation and softening of stool;​[[26]](#psc1031n1017) few adults consume this level. A daily minimum goal of 10 g per day of total dietary fibre is often sufficient. The quantity should be titrated upward gradually by 5 g per week to avoid bloating. Along with increased fibre intake should be adequate fluid intake, especially in the elderly, dehydrated, institutionalized and those consuming less than 500 mL fluid per day. Stool weight increases and fecal transit time usually decreases with adequate fibre supplementation but pain or stool frequency usually do not improve.​[[10]](#psc1031n1005)

For best laxative effect, the fibre should resist fermentation and remain relatively intact through the bowel lumen.​[[27]](#refitem-1282127-9FB579D2) Soluble fibre (e.g., psyllium) may improve symptoms of straining and pain and may increase the number of bowel movements in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. These high viscosity fibres form a gel and resist dehydration. Data for insoluble fibre (e.g., dark leafy vegetables, rye bread, wheat bran, whole grains) are conflicting.​[[28]](#psc1031n01197) These fibres act differently, mechanically irritating the gut, causing stimulation of water and mucus secretion. Of note, wheat fibre may induce constipation.​[[27]](#refitem-1282127-9FB579D2) Patients with confirmed slow-transit constipation or pelvic floor dyssynergia respond poorly to a high-fibre diet. Biofeedback may be a more effective option in these patients, but standardization of protocols are required.​[[29]](#refitem-1282128-9FB6FD60) [Table 4](#psc1031n00013) lists the fibre content of some common foods.

**Table 4:** Dietary Fibre in Selected Raw Foods​[[30]](#psc1031n1019)

| Food Source | ≥5 g fibre/100 g | 2–5 g fibre/100 g | <2 g fibre/100 g |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

### Adults

- Increase calories if low caloric intake: This helps improve colonic transit.​[[10]](#psc1031n1005)
- Have a regular bowel regimen: Patients should attempt to have a bowel movement at the same time each day especially after breakfast, since colonic activity is highest at that time. Encourage patients to heed the urge to defecate and discourage them from spending prolonged periods of time at the toilet. Placing a footstool in front of the toilet helps elevate the thighs, thus placing the pelvis in the optimum position for defecation.​[[2]](#psc1031n1002)​[[7]](#psc1031n1007) In the bedridden, mild physical activity like leg raises can work like the pelvic tilt.​[[31]](#refitem-1282166-A0C436B9)
- Consume a high-fibre diet: The target is 25–38 g of fibre daily or 10–20 g/1000 cal.​[[26]](#psc1031n1017)​[[32]](#psc1031n1020) [Table 4](#psc1031n00013) lists the fibre content of some common foods. Soluble fibre has better evidence than insoluble fibre. Patients with poor dentition can eat foods that are easy to chew such as bran muffins, bran cereal, fibre biscuits, applesauce and baked beans. Fibre-enriched formulations of nutritional supplement drinks are available for those patients unable to prepare meals, or as snacks between meals. Thirty to 90 (2–6 tbsp) of wheat bran daily taken with a 250 mL glass of water or juice can be used to supplement dietary fibre. Gas production from soluble fibre metabolism may limit acceptance.
- Eat more fruit: Apples, pears and prunes contain the natural laxative sorbitol.
- Exercise: Because inactivity is associated with constipation, exercise has been advocated as a treatment option. Small studies show adding mild-moderate exercise to lifestyle improve colonic transit time and defecation patterns.​[[33]](#refitem-1282131-A0B0F8C8) It should be noted that this intervention may be less applicable if patients already have a pre-existing regular exercise regimen of moderate to high intensity. Studies do not show that increasing the intensity of exercise improves levels of constipation.​[[34]](#refitem-1282133-A0B183BC) Exercise should be continued for many preventive health reasons.
- Lose weight: Weight loss is suggested for the treatment of chronic constipation in overweight patients. Statistical benefit has not been proven but is still worth recommending.​[[35]](#refitem-1282132-A0AFCB80) The goal is to reach a weight compatible with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5–24.9.
- Biofeedback and relaxation: Biofeedback and relaxation training has been used in the treatment of constipation caused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Patients can train to relax their pelvic floor muscles and to coordinate relaxation and pushing during defecation.​[[16]](#psc1031n1010) Further well-designed trials are necessary to confirm effectiveness.

### Children

Childhood constipation affects 0.7–2.9% of the population worldwide with prevalence in both developed and Third World regions. Psychological stress, poor eating habits, obesity and childhood maltreatment are all predisposing causes. Changing modifiable risk factors is a target.

Fibre intake should be obtained through diet. Current evidence does not support fibre supplements in treatment of pediatric functional constipation. Rather, increased fluid, fruit and vegetable intake may reduce the risk of functional constipation.​[[36]](#refitem-1282135-A0B58D19)

- Aim for a daily dietary fibre level ≥10 g for children 3–7 years of age and ≥15 g for children 8–14.​[[37]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed18571-9A21844A) Use 60 mL of non-dairy fluid for every gram of fibre.
- In infants 6–12 months of age, juices that contain sorbitol (e.g., prune, apple and pear) can increase the frequency of bowel movements and water content of stools; limit intake to 1–3 mL/kg/day.
- For children 1–6 years of age, limit fruit juices to 120–180 mL/day; for the 7–18 year age group, limit sorbital-based juices to 250–360 mL or 2 servings/day.​[[38]](#refitem-1282137-A0B60A5B)
- Restrict dairy intake. A time-limited trial of a cow's milk–free diet may improve refractory constipation if there is sensitivity or allergy​[[38]](#refitem-1282137-A0B60A5B); ensure adequate calcium intake through alternate sources. Soy milk is associated with a higher rate of improved consistency in children with a cow's milk sensitivity.​[[39]](#refitem-1282138-A0BEEF12)
- A normal level of physical activity is recommended with functional constipation. Additional pelvic physical therapy to the standard of care may improve outcomes in children with functional constipation (NNT = 2).​[[40]](#refitem-1282138-A0BD264F)
- Evidence suggests that behavioural therapy added to diet/laxative therapy improves the relief of symptoms.​[[41]](#refitem-1282139-A0BDDE72) Children with functional constipation should be encouraged to attempt defecation 5–10 minutes after each meal until they have a bowel movement that day. Biofeedback may be beneficial for the treatment of a small subgroup of children with intractable constipation.​[[42]](#psc1031n1024)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for constipation, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Constipation in Adults.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Colon Electrolyte Lavage, Laxatives.

Constipation should not be managed through medications in the presence of an obstruction or ileus.​[[43]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed25845-9A178EFB)

There are 4 groups of laxatives: bulk-forming, emollient, osmotic and stimulant; high-dose osmotic agents can also be classified as purgative laxatives (see [Table 7](#d2e2899)).​[[44]](#psc1031n1026)​[[45]](#psc1031n1029)​[[46]](#psc1031n01198)​[[47]](#Httpwww.cps.cadocumentspositionfunc-1088B8FD) Other drug classes include mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., methylnaltrexone, naloxegol), prokinetic agents (e.g., domperidone, erythromycin, prucalopride), guanylate cyclase C-agonists (e.g., linaclotide) and serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonists (e.g., prucalopride).

Detailed discussions regarding acute constipation, chronic constipation (including opioid-induced constipation, and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome) and constipation in special populations can be found under [Treatment Considerations](#treatmentconsiderations) and [Constipation in Special Populations](#psc1031n01210).

### Bulk-Forming Laxatives

Bulk-forming laxatives increase stool volume and are considered the safest agents suitable for long-term use.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004) Their fermentation in the colon leads to gas formation, increased osmotic load, water retention and wall stress, which stimulate motility.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004)​[[48]](#psc1031n1031) Each dose of a bulk-forming laxative should be administered with at least 250 mL of water or juice to prevent fecal impaction and/or esophageal obstruction.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004) Do not use if patient is dehydrated or fluid restricted, as impaction may result. On average, the bulk-forming laxative requires 12–72 hours for onset of effect. Psyllium improves stool frequency and consistency and bran reduces the use of laxatives in the elderly. Inulin is a fermentable, nonviscous soluble fibre that has little water holding capacity and has less laxative benefit than viscous fibre. However, 3–4 g of **chicory inulin** has been proven more effective than placebo at increasing the number and softness of stools.​[[49]](#refitem-1282150-A0BFEFC1) Although there is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of calcium polycarbophil and methylcellulose in the management of constipation, these agents are still recommended if patients cannot use or tolerate other bulk-forming laxatives.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004)​[[28]](#psc1031n01197) Fibre shows consistent beneficial effect for relieving overall symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.​[[6]](#psc1031n1004)

### Emollients (Stool Softeners)

Stool softeners (e.g., docusate **sodium** or docusate **calcium**) act as surfactants to soften the stool by allowing the mixing of aqueous and fatty substances.​[[11]](#psc1031n1006) Although used commonly for many years, the supporting evidence for effectiveness is lacking and they do not improve symptoms of chronic constipation.​[[50]](#psc1031n1033) Some weak, anectodal evidence exists supporting the use of stool softeners post-urogynecological surgery and post MI.​[[51]](#refitem-1282151-A0C0882C)

**Heavy** mineral oil is not generally recommended due to risk of lipid aspiration and binding of fat-soluble medications. Studies in pediatric patients have shown it is superior to senna-based laxatives for frequency and stool consistency and inferior to osmotic agents, which have fewer risks.​[[3]](#psc1031n1003)​[[52]](#psc1031n1022)​[[53]](#psc1031n1021)

### Osmotic Laxatives

Osmotic agents contain poorly absorbed ions or molecules that create an osmotic gradient and retain water within the intestinal lumen; the increased pressure on the lumen wall induces gastric motility.​[[9]](#psc1031n1009)​[[54]](#psc1031n1034)​[[55]](#psc1031n1035) Polyethylene glycol **(PEG)** and lactulose are examples of osmotic laxatives.​[[9]](#psc1031n1009)​[[54]](#psc1031n1034)​[[55]](#psc1031n1035)

PEG is a safe, effective and well-tolerated agent and causes less flatulence and bloating in adults compared with other osmotic laxatives.​[[56]](#psc1031n01199) PEG is superior to lactulose (NNT = 3 vs. 4) in outcomes of stool frequency per week, stool form and consistency, relief of abdominal pain, and need for additional products.​[[57]](#refitem-1282157-A0C14005)​[[58]](#psc1031n01191)​[[59]](#psc1031n01200) PEG is considered more palatable than lactulose. Daily use of PEG (up to 6 months) is safe and effective​[[60]](#psc1031n01192) and may facilitate the discontinuation of other laxatives. However, as many as 40% of patients may experience diarrhea with PEG or lactulose. Lower doses help prevent bloating, cramping, flatulence and electrolyte abnormalities. PEG may also be effective in the management of opioid-induced constipation.​[[61]](#psc1031n1036) Both are safe for use in diabetics as the osmotic agents (e.g., lactulose) are not absorbed but remain in the intestinal lumen. Osmotic laxatives require 24–72 hours for onset of action and are best used regularly rather than as needed, as onset of action is delayed due to mechanism.

Glycerin **suppositories** act osmotically and have a quicker onset of action (approximately 15–30 minutes). They are less effective if the stool is dry and hard or higher in the colon. Glycerin suppositories should be moistened with lukewarm water before insertion; they should be retained as long as possible.

There is some evidence that milk of magnesia can be used for chronic constipation in patients with normal renal function.​[[62]](#psc1031n1027) Limitations include frequent diarrhea, multiple electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia) and hypovolemia.​[[63]](#psc1031n1037) These side effects may occur even in the absence of pre-existing renal failure. They should be administered with sufficient water to prevent dehydration.​[[62]](#psc1031n1027) Due to lower level of evidence and risk factors, milk of magnesia is considered a second-line osmotic laxative.

### Purgatives

Both high-volume PEG with added electrolytes and low-volume PEG without electrolytes have been shown to be safe and effective when used at high doses as purgatives; however, repeated or prolonged use of high-volume PEG with electrolytes may result in electrolyte imbalance. Caution should also be exercised in the use of PEG with electrolytes in patients with renal impairment, patients taking diuretics and pediatric or geriatric patients.​[[64]](#2012ColytePM)​[[65]](#2015PegLytePM)​[[66]](#2015Boles26170773)

**Oral** sodium phosphate products should *not* be used as purgatives since they may cause serious electrolyte, kidney, cardiovascular and neurologic problems, but they are still considered safe and effective for laxative use. Magnesium citrate is generally reserved for bowel cleansing. Osmotic laxatives alone or in combination with stimulants are most commonly used as cathartics before surgery or intestinal procedures.

### Stimulant Laxatives

This group of laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna, sodium picosulfate) increases colonic peristalsis by producing rhythmic muscle contractions in the intestines and may be recommended if osmotic laxatives fail or are not tolerated.​[[62]](#psc1031n1027)​[[67]](#psc1031n1038) All 3 medications are prodrugs. Senna is activated in the large bowel whereas bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate are activated in the alkaline medium of the small intestine.​[[68]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed22248-9A21296D) Bisacodyl has an NNT = 3 based on a moderate level of evidence. By contrast, there is low-quality evidence to support the use of sennosides.​[[31]](#refitem-1282166-A0C436B9) Higher level of abdominal cramping may ensue with bisacodyl.​[[31]](#refitem-1282166-A0C436B9) Limiting their use helps minimize melanosis coli (rare), abdominal discomfort, electrolyte imbalances, allergic reactions and hepatotoxicity.

Stimulant laxatives are likely safe in the treatment of chronic constipation.​[[62]](#psc1031n1027) Some evidence supports the short-term (4 weeks) efficacy and safety of bisacodyl​[[69]](#psc1031n01190) and sodium picosulfate​[[70]](#psc1031n01189) in chronic constipation.​[[71]](#psc1031n01206) Continuous daily usage may cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia and dehydration. Stimulant laxatives are usually administered at bedtime due to a 6–12 hour delay in onset and are the laxatives of choice for opioid-induced constipation.

Castor oil is no longer recommended as a laxative and is contraindicated in pregnant and elderly patients. It produces abdominal cramping and pain, stimulates uterine contractions during pregnancy and can be aspirated.

### Enemas

There is only anecdotal evidence for the value of enemas in the management of chronic constipation. However, many clinicians and patients find them useful and effective for the treatment of acute constipation and as a means of preparing or cleansing the distal colon for endoscopic or surgical procedures. Enemas generally have faster onset than suppositories and produce cleansing within an hour of administration. They are, however, less socially accepted by North Americans for chronic constipation and are mainly used for bowel cleansing prior to intestinal procedures. Caution is warranted when using enemas in the elderly since they are associated with increased mortality.​[[72]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed23658-9995F73A)

Soap suds, tap water and milk of molasses enema have fallen out of use due to a high level of colonic irritation.

**Instructions for Administering an Enema**

The patient should:

- Lubricate the enema nozzle if it is not pre-lubricated
- Lie on left side with knees bent
- Insert the enema nozzle into the rectum, with the nozzle pointing towards the navel
- Gently squeeze the container until the dose is expelled; if discomfort is felt at this point, the flow is probably too fast
- Retain the solution until definite abdominal cramping is felt

### Probiotics

Evidence is growing to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation. A meta-analysis including 21 studies of 2656 subjects who used probiotics containing Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species showed a mean increase in weekly stool frequency of 0.3 and a mean reduction in intestinal transit time of 0.65.​[[73]](#refitem-1282172-A0C5AC8F) A systematic review of 9 studies in elderly patients showed an improvement in constipation of 10–40% with probiotics compared with placebo, with Bifidobacterium longum the most common strain studied.​[[74]](#refitem-1282172-A0C522DE) The heterogeneity among probiotic trials makes it difficult to determine the most beneficial strains, dosage, dosing frequency and duration of treatment.​[[75]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed25099-9997A164)​[[76]](#psc1031n1040)​[[77]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed25070-9997D52D)

### Natural Health Products

Only a few small randomized controlled trials and little other evidence supports the efficacy and/or safety of the following herbal treatments: aloes, bitter orange, buckthorn, dandelion, elderberry, hemp seed, lavender, licorice, rhubarb and soy. Yellow dock is an effective laxative but its safety has not been definitively established.​[[78]](#ErnstEPittlerMHWiderBEds.xa0TheDesk-A4C1DE76)​[[79]](#BoonHSmithM.xa0HealthCareProfession-A4C21374)

### Treatment Considerations

### Long-Term Use of Laxatives

Most patients suffering from constipation will self-medicate. They may overuse laxatives and antidiarrheals, resulting in a pendulum effect between constipation and diarrhea. This type of abuse is present in about 4% of laxative users.​[[2]](#psc1031n1002) All drugs currently available for treatment of constipation are generally safe at prescribed doses but further long-term safety data is required.​[[80]](#refitem-1282175-A0C626A7) Long-term use of stimulant laxatives has traditionally been discouraged based on tests linking long-term use to damage of the enteric nervous system in the mesenteric plexus and smooth muscles of the colon. However, the results of these tests have not been confirmed by newer technologic methods. Many experts now believe that the risks of long-term stimulant laxative use have been overemphasized, and that they are safe for daily use.​[[81]](#psc1031n1032) However, due to the increased cost and side effects such as cramping, reserve stimulants for third-line therapy when previous treatment has failed.

Melanosis coli is a melanotic hyperpigmentation of the colonic mucosa that occurs after long-term use of the anthraquinones (e.g., senna). It is benign and reverses 3–12 months after discontinuation of the laxative.

Other side effects of laxative overuse include various electrolyte abnormalities; hypermagnesemia, hypernatremia and hyperphosphatemia can occur due to accumulation of absorbed ions derived from the laxative.​[[63]](#psc1031n1037) Hypernatremia can also arise when large volumes of osmotic laxatives cause substantial water loss from the GI tract and corresponding fluid intake is insufficient to maintain homeostasis. Hypokalemia may result as the body tries to regain fluid losses by activating the renin-aldosterone system.​[[8]](#psc1031n1008)

### Acute Constipation

Acute and chronic constipation require different management. Acute constipation lacks a clear definition, the prevalence is unknown and the optimal management has not been well studied. Therapy is often based on the patient's level of discomfort. In general, it is best to clear out hard stool in the distal bowel before using a bulk agent or an aggressive oral regimen.​[[82]](#psc1031n1044) A reasonable approach is to use an agent with a relatively quick onset of action, e.g., glycerin or bisacodyl suppositories.​[[7]](#psc1031n1007) As well, saline laxatives may be used to treat acute constipation if there is no indication of bowel obstruction, heart failure or renal impairment.​[[7]](#psc1031n1007) If constipation is not relieved within 48 hours, an agent with a quicker onset of action such as an enema or oral milk of magnesia should be used.

Fecal impaction should be managed by a health-care professional; patients should not attempt to disimpact themselves unless trained to do so. Impaction must be relieved before maintenance treatment can begin; bulk-forming laxatives should be avoided in impacted patients. Disimpaction may be initiated manually, followed by a phosphate, saline or mineral oil enema (with or without a local anesthetic lubricant) daily for up to 3 days. Tap water or soapsuds enemas should be avoided as they irritate the colonic mucosa and may result in proctitis or colitis.​[[20]](#psc1031n1014) If the stool blockage is higher up in the colon than can be reached with enemas and the patient has no sign of bowel obstruction, oral polyethylene glycol may be used to disimpact the patient (2 L for 1–2 days or 1 L for 3 days).​[[83]](#psc1031n01201) A single 68 g dose of polyethylene glycol relieved impaction within 19 hours.​[[84]](#refitem-1282179-A0C7FDAD)

### Chronic Constipation

Chronic means that the symptoms of constipation occur frequently over a long period of time (i.e., more than 3 months). When symptoms cannot be attributed to medication or an underlying illness, the constipation is considered idiopathic. Constipation occurring chronically may cause atonic bowels with a dependency on laxatives to stimulate motility. Stimulant laxatives may be necessary in patients with slow motility secondary to diabetes or use of opioid medications. In most cases, the laxative should be tapered down to the lowest effective dose in order to minimize side effects.

The symptoms of chronic constipation may include:

- Infrequent stools (having a bowel movement less than 3 times a week)
- Difficulty passing stools, including:

  - straining to have a bowel movement
  - incomplete bowel emptying after a movement
  - hard or lumpy stools
- Gas pain
- Abdominal discomfort
- Bloating

Osmotic and stimulant laxatives are traditionally the only treatment options used for chronic constipation. PEG and lactulose are effective for increasing stool frequency and improving consistency based on high level of evidence. Bisacodyl has been shown efficacious as a stimulant with moderate evidence. Two newer classes of medications have been added for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation: guanylate cyclase-C agonist (i.e., linaclotide) and 5HT4 agonist (i.e., prucalopride). Of note, in a comparative meta-analysis, none of the drugs appear superior at improving the endpoints of 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements at 1 week.​[[85]](#refitem-1282182-A35F21BF)

Prucalopride is a highly selective 5HT4 receptor agonist that causes the release of acetylcholine and increased gut motility compared with placebo. Outcomes include reduced flatulence and improved stool frequency and consistency; however, there was no change in volume of gas retained (NNT = 5).​[[86]](#refitem-1282183-A36038BD) The prucalopride starting dose is 2 mg once daily; if no bowel movement occurs within 3–4 days, adjunctive laxative therapy may be added. If it is efficacious, continue treatment but reassess the need for therapy at 3-month intervals; if not effective after 4 weeks of treatment, discontinue. Compared with previous drugs in this class, prucalopride has no significant cardiac implications due to its high affinity for intestinal receptors, but long-term safety data has yet to be determined.

Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist that increases chloride and bicarbonate secretions into the gut and blocks sodium absorption; the net result is increased fluid in the gut lumen, which results in improvement in the number of spontaneous bowel movements per week. The results of high-quality trials indicate it is efficacious for chronic idiopathic constipation at a dose of 145 mcg daily. Alternatively, 72 mcg daily may be used and improves constipation in both women and men with a low rate of discontinuation secondary to diarrhea (NNT = 6).

A therapeutic approach should start with increased diet and medicinal fibre, adding an osmotic laxative if no change, and then augmenting with a stimulant laxative. As a final step, consider using the newer agents such as linaclotideor prucalopride. Biofeedback can improve symptoms in >70% of patients.​[[87]](#refitem-1282184-A3BA9BAA)

Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS‑C) is one of 3 major subtypes of IBS. IBS-C is a functional GI disorder defined as abdominal pain or discomfort that occurs weekly along with altered bowel habits: change in stool frequency and appearance over a period of 3 months. It shares many of the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation.​[[87]](#refitem-1282184-A3BA9BAA) For further discussion on IBS-C, refer to the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

Chronic constipation is treated in a stepwise approach (see [Table 5](#psc1031n01068)).​[[88]](#psc1031n1043)

**Table 5:** Management of Chronic Constipation

| Step I | Unless a modifiable cause is identified, chronic constipation is initially managed by patient education, lifestyle modification and dietary changes, including fibre supplementation (bran) and/or bulk-forming laxatives. Fibre intake should be increased gradually every 7–10 days. Stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna), glycerin suppository and/or enemas may be used as rescue treatment if no bowel movement has occurred for 2 consecutive days. |
| Step II | After a 4- to 6-wk trial, if the problem persists, second-line agents such as an osmotic (e.g., lactulose, polyethylene glycol) may be added and titrated based on efficacy and tolerability. |
| Step III | Third-line agents such as emollients and stimulants should be limited to short-term use as rescue therapy or after other agents have failed. This is due to the high incidence of side effects from these classes. |
| Step IV | Prosecretory or prokinetic agents may be tried for chronic idiopathic constipation for an 8- to 12-wk trial prior to reassessment for maintenance or specialist referral. |

### Opioid-Induced Constipation

Constipation is prevalent in 50% of cancer patients and rises to 87% in the palliative patient.​[[67]](#psc1031n1038) Changes in pathophysiology include decreased GI motility, increased intestinal fluid absorption, increased anal sphincter tone and decreased anorectal sensitivity to distention; this leads to dry, hard stools with little movement. The cancer may also cause tumour compression of the large intestine or interference with colonic neural innervation. When high-dose opioids are required, this adds the factor of opioid paralysis causing overall poor bowel evacuation (see ).​[[89]](#psc1031n1052)

The best therapy to manage constipation in this population is uncertain. Traditionally, stimulant laxatives have been the mainstay of therapy with rescue enemas or bisacodyl suppositories used when required for a period not exceeding 3 days. Higher doses of stimulant laxatives may be necessary in palliative patients (e.g., senna 34.4 mg TID, bisacodyl 20 mg TID). Laxative dose may be increased every 24–48 hours until response or a ceiling dose is reached. It is common in practice to require a combination of both osmotic and stimulant classes for dual action.​[[68]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed22248-9A21296D) Either lactulose and **PEG** also may be used but may cause nausea.​[[55]](#psc1031n1035) Impaction should be ruled out if the patient has not passed a stool in more than 3 days.​[[67]](#psc1031n1038) Diarrhea may be misleading, but overflow incontinence may be secondary to constipation if recent drug therapy or physical changes have occurred.

Combination opioids and naloxone are available and are claimed to reduce the incidence of opioid-induced constipation, but evidence is sparse and dosage availability limited.

There is significant evidence supporting the use of peripheral acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., methylnaltrexone, naloxegol) in treatment of opioid-induced constipation not responsive to traditional osmotic and stimulant laxatives. These agents are considered second line if traditional laxatives fail.​[[90]](#refitem-1282164-A3406C69) Although therapeutically effective, methylnaltrexone requires subcutaneous administration. Naloxegol given orally has similar mechanism of action used at doses of 12.5–25 mg.​[[91]](#refitem-1282165-A33EDEFE) It helps to restore the level of spontaneous bowel movements compared to placebo (NNT = 4) and does not impede pain therapy as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is safe in CV trials with no QT prolongation although caution should be exercised in moderate to severe renal impairment. Side effects may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, headache and flatulence (NNH = 14).​[[92]](#refitem-1282164-A1455E7F) Overall, it does improve quality of life scores but should be reserved as second line after failure of maximum tolerated doses of laxatives.

Avoid bulk-forming agents since they may cause impaction.​[[67]](#psc1031n1038) Stool softeners are unlikely to have any benefit in this population. In neutropenic or thrombocytopenic patients, avoid rectal manipulation to prevent infection or bleeding; give oral laxatives and cathartics only.

### Constipation in Special Populations

### Pediatrics

The overwhelming majority of children with chronic constipation suffer from functional constipation, involving a cycle of pain on defecation, fecal retention and chronic rectal distention.​[[52]](#psc1031n1022) Chronic constipation is estimated to occur in 1–5% of children. A third of these children have chronic constipation beyond puberty.​[[52]](#psc1031n1022) Management of constipation specific to the treatment of infants and children is presented below.

### Infants

- The use of enemas is not recommended in infants due to risk of mechanical trauma; use only if >2 years of age.​[[3]](#psc1031n1003)​[[52]](#psc1031n1022)​[[53]](#psc1031n1021)
- Rectal disimpaction of infants can be achieved with pediatric glycerin suppositories.​[[3]](#psc1031n1003)
- Barley malt extract, corn syrup or sorbitol can be used as stool softeners.​[[52]](#psc1031n1022)
- Heavy mineral oil and stimulant laxatives are not recommended for infants.​[[53]](#psc1031n1021)

### Children ≥1 Year

There are no trials assessing the effectiveness of bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium) in children. **PEG**,​[[93]](#psc1031n01203) lactulose or sorbitol are considered first-line agents for the treatment of constipation whereas magnesium hydroxide is second line.​[[52]](#psc1031n1022)​[[94]](#psc1031n1023) PEG is superior to lactulose and magnesium hydroxide in this population, increasing stools by 2.6 per week.​[[93]](#psc1031n01203) A meta-analysis comparing PEG and lactulose found that more patients taking lactulose require additional laxative (18% vs. 31%). Side effects include flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and headache. Of the different polyethylene glycols, the PEG 3350 is better tolerated and accepted by children than the PEG with electrolytes.​[[95]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed23152-9A21D6D8) PEG is preferred over lactulose by 73% of parents.

Young children are at increased risk of lipoid pneumonia due to aspiration of mineral oil and fecal leakage.​[[94]](#psc1031n1023) For safety, heavy mineral oil is considered third line.​[[94]](#psc1031n1023) No evidence supports the use of stool softeners. Senna and bisacodyl can be used as rescue medication when other agents have failed.​[[52]](#psc1031n1022)

Disimpaction with enemas is recommended after diagnosis of impaction via rectal examination or, in some cases, abdominal radiography; higher doses of oral PEG 3350 1–1.5 g/kg/day may also be effective but may take up to 5 days of treatment.​[[54]](#psc1031n1034) A study comparing enema (e.g., milk and molasses) versus PEG for disimpaction found that enema was superior in efficacy at day 1 (85% vs. 55%); however, over half of the children in the enema group were distressed while none were in the PEG group. There was no difference in efficacy outcomes at days 3–5.​[[96]](#refitem-1282184-A0CB0C1C)

After disimpaction, maintenance therapy should be initiated. Continue maintenance therapy for 1–2 months once the child has >3 stools/week and no soiling. Diet, behaviour management and toilet training should be maintained and laxative treatment discontinued gradually over several months. Symptoms resolve in 6–12 months in 50–60% of children with functional constipation.​[[97]](#refitem-1282185-A0CC48A5)

Note that prucalopride is not effective in children with functional constipation.​[[98]](#refitem-1282186-A0CCA0A0)

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Constipation affects 25–30% of women in late pregnancy and up to 3 months postpartum.​[[99]](#psc1031n1045)​[[100]](#psc1031n1048) It is thought to be secondary to elevated progesterone levels causing muscle relaxation in the intestine. It may also be due to the use of calcium and iron supplements and the gravid uterus pushing on the colon.​[[101]](#psc1031n1046) Psyllium, **dietary** bran or **wheat fibre** is preferred as initial treatment of constipation during pregnancy or breastfeeding to increase the frequency of defecation and soften stools.​[[102]](#psc1031n1047) Adequate fluid consumption is necessary during pregnancy and especially during breastfeeding to prevent dehydration and stimulate milk production. There is a lack of reliable data studying the safety of laxatives while breastfeeding. Due to lack of evidence, safety guidelines should parallel data from pregnancy trials. Docusate has traditionally been added if fibre supplementation has failed during pregnancy and breastfeeding but there is little evidence to support this practice. Heavy mineral oil is not absorbed systemically but may impede vitamin or mineral absorption. It may induce premature uterine contractions so is not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

If stools remain hard, consider adding or switching to lactulose or **PEG**. Both are safe and effective; lactulose has the risk of bloating, flatulence and PEG abdominal cramps. Milk of magnesia is an effective agent but the salt osmotic gradient may cause maternal sodium retention—a risk to mid- to late pregnancy.​[[102]](#psc1031n1047)

A Cochrane review found that **stimulant laxatives** are more effective than dietary or medicinal fibre therapy but cause more side effects of diarrhea and abdominal pain; they are reserved for short-term use when other agents have failed.​[[102]](#psc1031n1047) Use stimulant and osmotic laxatives short term to prevent possible dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.​[[103]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed22893-9A21FCCF) Occasional use of glycerin or bisacodyl suppositories is also an option. One study found no association between senna and higher risk of congenital abnormalities in pregnant women.​[[104]](#psc1031n1049)

Prucalopride use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. During clinical trials, spontaneous abortion occurred but causal association has not been established.​[[105]](#refitem-1282193-A0CE13A1)

Linaclotide is not measurable in plasma at recommended doses. It should be safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding but limited data is available.​[[105]](#refitem-1282193-A0CE13A1)

### Elderly

Treatment of the older adult is often complicated by comorbidities, cognitive impairment and polypharmacy.​[[88]](#psc1031n1043) The prevalence of constipation increases from one-quarter of the female population at 65 years of age to one-third by 85.​[[31]](#refitem-1282166-A0C436B9) The incidence of constipation is slightly lower in the elderly male population. There is a paucity of evidence-based recommendations in the management of constipation in the elderly.​[[106]](#psc1031n1050) Management should be tailored to each individual's needs and expectations regardless of age or place of residence.

Functional abilities related to mobility, following instructions, communicating needs, eating, drinking and cognitive status must be assessed.​[[18]](#psc1031n1012)

Fluid intake should target 1500–2000 mL daily unless fluid restrictions are imposed as in those with heart failure. Low fluid consumption with bulk-forming laxatives can exacerbate constipation. Dietary fibre should be targeted at 25–30 g daily, which may allow discontinuation of laxatives and may increase the senior's well-being.​[[106]](#psc1031n1050) Exercise may be performed to patient's capacity; pelvic tilt, trunk rotation and leg lifts are recommended for bedridden patients.​[[107]](#psc1031n1051) Medication review should rule out polypharmacy and drug-induced constipation.​[[24]](#psc1031n1016)

Incidence of cognitive impairment, fall rate, delirium, urinary incontinence and depression have been found higher in a study of nursing home residents with opioid-induced constipation.​[[108]](#refitem-1282198-A0CE7C9B) Opioid-induced constipation is a risk in patients with a high burden of anticholinergic medications and high/chronic opioid doses. Caution should be applied to avoid these medications and, if required, to keep doses to the lowest possible effective dose. If using opioids, a laxative should be started at the beginning of therapy.​[[108]](#refitem-1282198-A0CE7C9B)

Clients have an incrementally higher risk of constipation with each advancing state of renal failure. The level of renal impairment must be determined prior to using laxatives.​[[109]](#refitem-1282199-A0CEEDAA) The use of **saline laxatives** is contraindicated in renal and heart failure. Saline osmotics have been linked to increased death, secondary to congestive heart failure. Limitations for use include possible multiple electrolyte abnormalities such as hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.​[[110]](#psc1031n01205) When used, oral saline laxatives (e.g., sodium phosphate) should be administered with sufficient water to prevent dehydration. Magnesium citrate is generally reserved for bowel cleansing and should be used with caution in renal impairment. **PEG** (without electrolytes) or lactulose is safe and effective for use in seniors suffering from acute or chronic constipation.​[[60]](#psc1031n01192) A trial comparing PEG 4000 to lactulose in clients over 70 years of age with chronic constipation showed PEG did not affect nutrition and had few side effects; this clinical tolerance enhanced compliance and contributed to the efficacy of PEG versus lactulose.​[[111]](#refitem-12821101-A0CF504C) Also, lactulose is cleared during hemodialysis by 83.6% requiring dosage supplementation.​[[112]](#refitem-12821102-A0CFF1D0) Stimulant laxatives (e.g., senna, bisacodyl) may cause severe cramping and electrolyte losses when used long term.​[[112]](#refitem-12821102-A0CFF1D0)

Encourage institutions to establish an interdisciplinary team approach to prevent and manage constipation.​[[24]](#psc1031n1016)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 6](#psc1031n01079) provides a monitoring plan framework that should be individualized.

The use of a daily bowel log may be helpful in patients with chronic constipation, including children. A sample log is included in Constipation—What You Need to Know.

**Table 6:** Monitoring of Therapy for Constipation

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inability to have bowel movement | Acute constipation: Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: after 1–3 days of therapy, depending upon the agent chosen | Full bowel movement. | Add agent with a relatively quick onset of action (e.g., glycerin suppository). If other laxative not effective, or if patient has not had a bowel movement in 7 days, reassess. |
|  | Chronic constipation: as above plus: Patient: keep daily bowel log (see Daily Bowel Log sample in Constipation—What You Need to Know ) Health-care practitioner: check with patient weekly for 4 wk | Chronic constipation: as above, plus established regular bowel patterns after 1 month. | Chronic constipation: if patient has not established regular patterns after 1 month, reassess treatment plan. |
| Bloating, cramping | Acute constipation: Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: day 3 | Bloating and cramping relieved shortly after full bowel movement occurs. | If full bowel movement has occurred but bloating and cramping are not relieved, reassess. |

### Advice for the Patient

All patients should receive advice regarding:

- Normal variation in frequency of bowel movements
- Nonpharmacologic methods of treating and preventing constipation
- Development of an individualized bowel routine
- Evaluation of the signs and symptoms of constipation and when patients should contact a health-care practitioner

In addition, all patients who require drug therapy should receive counselling regarding:

- The expected onset of action of the laxative and what to do if constipation is not relieved (long-term constipation may require weeks to months of therapy for bowel habits to adjust)
- Usual side effects of the medication

| glycerin generics <$1 | Adults: 2.6 g suppository PR daily or BID PRN. Insert high into rectum and retain for 15 min if possible Children: 1.44 g suppository PR daily or BID PRN. Insert high into rectum and retain for 15 min if possible Onset: 15–30 min | Rectal irritation. | No known drug interactions. | May dissolve in hands if not inserted soon after unwrapping. |
| lactulose generics <$1 | >12 y: 15–30 mL daily or BID PO 6–12 y: 10 mL BID PO 1–5 y: 5 mL BID PO Onset: 24–48 h | Flatulence and abdominal cramps are common, especially at the beginning of therapy. Nausea is more common with higher doses. Diarrhea is a sign of overdosage. | Slower absorption of medication from the intestine due to acidification. Ideally, do not take within 2 h of other medication. | Many patients find sweet taste intolerable. Avoid in patients who require a galactose-free diet. 667 mg lactulose = 147 mg galactose, <80 mg lactose. Not absorbed systemically. Can be used by patients with diabetes. |
| magnesium citrate Citro-Mag , generics $3–6 | Adults: 75–150 mL once daily PO as laxative. 300 mL once PO as cathartic Drink 250 mL water before and after each dose Children (maintenance): >12 y: 150–300 mL once daily PO 6–12 y: 50–100 mL once daily PO <6 y: 1–3 mL/kg once daily PO Do not exceed adult dose Onset: 0.5–3 h | Risk of hypermagnesemia increased with overdose, in infants and those with renal impairment. | May reduce bioavailability of digoxin and the tetracyclines. | Reserve use as laxative after treatment failure of other agents. Caution with dehydration. Not recommended with cardiac or renal disease. Chill solution before administration for greater palatability. Often used as a cathartic prior to surgery or GI procedures. |
| magnesium hydroxide Milk of Magnesia , generics <$1 | Adults: 15–30 mL daily or BID PO Children: 80–240 mg/kg daily PO Do not exceed adult dose Onset: 0.5–3 h | Risk of hypermagnesemia increased with overdose and in infants and those with renal impairment. Hypokalemia may also occur with prolonged use or overdose. Dehydration, abdominal cramps, incontinence. | No known drug interactions. | Caution with dehydration. Not recommended with cardiac or renal disease. |
| polyethylene glycol Lax-A-Day , Pegalax , RestoraLAX <$1 | Adults: 17 g (1 heaping tablespoonful) in 250 mL liquid once daily PO Children 2–18 y: 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day PO in 240 mL liquid (not to exceed adult dose) Onset: 48–96 h | Transient diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, retching, abdominal bloating, cramping, anal irritation. Pulmonary edema may occur if powder is aspirated. Mallory-Weiss tears have occurred. | Slower absorption of medication from the intestine due to acidification. Ideally, do not take within 2 h of other medication. | Available with or without electrolytes (both formulations are equally effective in the treatment of constipation). Causes retention of water in GI lumen. Not fermented into hydrogen or methane by the GI microbiota and has no effect on the absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes. Do not use if bowel obstruction. Space 2 h from other medication. Avoid high doses in the elderly due to increased risk of diarrhea. |
| sodium phosphate generics $3–6 | All doses of concentrated solution are diluted in 125 mL water and followed by 250 mL water ≥13 y: 20 mL of concentrated solution (with water as above) once daily PO 10–12 y: 10 mL of concentrated solution (with water as above) once daily PO 6–9 y: 5 mL of concentrated solution (with water as above) once daily PO Onset: 0.5–3 h Each 5 mL of concentrated solution contains 2.4 g monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate and 0.9 g dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate | Hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and hypernatremia have also been reported. Caution with renal or cardiac disease. | ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics and NSAIDs may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of sodium phosphate. | Considered to be safe as laxative but unsafe if used as purgative due to association with electrolyte disturbances and kidney injury. Best taken on an empty stomach upon rising, 30 min before a meal, or at bedtime. Not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Not recommended for sodium-restricted patients or for chronic use. |
| sorbitol 70% solution <$1 | Adults: 15–30 mL daily or BID PO Rectal enema 120 mL PR as 25–30% solution Children: 1–3 mL/kg in divided doses PO (not to exceed adult dose) Rectal enema 30–60 mL PR as 25–50% solution Onset: PO: 24–48 h PR: 5–15 min | Flatulence, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea. | No known drug interactions. | Cost-effective alternative to lactulose. Caution in severe cardiopulmonary or renal impairment. |

**Drug Class: Serotonin 5-HT4Receptor Agonists**

| prucalopride Resotran $3–6 | For chronic idiopathic constipation: 2 mg daily PO Reduce dose to 1 mg daily PO if >65 y , ClCr ≤30mL/min or severe hepatic impairment | Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, CNS depression, ischemic colitis (rare). | Potential for reduced effectiveness of oral contraceptives if diarrhea experienced; consider use of an alternative, nonhormonal means of contraception for the remainder of menstrual cycle. | For use in women only; not studied for use in men. If no bowel movement by day 3–4, consider add-on laxative (rescue treatment). Discontinue therapy if no benefit provided with 4 wk of treatment. Reassess for therapeutic benefit at regular intervals if prolonged therapy is needed. Caution if Child-Pugh class C hepatic impairment. Do not use with galactose intolerance. |

Incontinence. Rectal administration may cause rectal irritation or burning. | Should not be taken with milk, antacids or proton pump inhibitors because these products increase the pH of the upper GI tract causing the premature disintegration of the enteric coating in the stomach before the product reaches the colon. | Transferred into breast milk. Tablets should not be crushed, broken or chewed. |
| cascara sagrada <$1 | Adults: 2–5 mL or 0.3–1 g HS PO Not for use in children Onset: 6–12 h | Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, hypokalemia, allergic reactions. | No known drug interactions. | Avoid in pregnancy.
