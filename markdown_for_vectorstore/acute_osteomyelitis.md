### Goals of Therapy

- Cure the acute infection
- Minimize morbidity, e.g., loss of limb function
- Prevent recurrence and progression to chronic osteomyelitis

### Investigations

- History:

  - Duration of symptoms (generally lasting <2 wk): fever, pain, redness, swelling, limping or other loss of function or movement
  - Chronic symptoms (>2 wk, but often months) may warrant consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Depending on epidemiological risk factors (e.g., place of birth, time spent abroad), may consider less common bacterial causes such as tuberculosis or brucellosis
  - Any recent surgery, trauma, penetrating wound, prosthetic or foreign implanted material
  - Underlying conditions, e.g., sickle cell disease, vascular insufficiency, immunocompromised
  - Neuropathic ulcer of the diabetic foot; for further discussion of diabetic foot infections, see Diabetic Foot Infections
- Examination:

  - Tenderness over affected bone (can be exquisite)
  - Range of movement in affected limb. *Note:* pseudoparalysis around joint or warmth/erythema (may appear pink or red in light skin tones, or deeper red in darker skin tones) overlying a joint should raise concerns for septic arthritis and prompt urgent surgical referral
  - If vertebra involved, note presence of any abnormal neurologic findings
- Laboratory tests:

  - CBC and acute-phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) as baseline​[[1]](#c0096n00021)
  - Blood cultures (positive for bacteria in 25–30% of cases)​[[2]](#Woods2021) should be taken before starting antibacterials
- Aspiration/Biopsy:

  - Specimens should be sent for urgent Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures; consider fungal and mycobacterial cultures if host or epidemiological risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised host, chronic overlying open wound or open wound with history of water or soil exposure)
  - The best specimen is bone or periosteal aspirate, obtained surgically or by percutaneous biopsy through unaffected skin.​[[3]](#c0096n00022) Superficial wound culture of an overlying ulcer or draining sinus often identifies the presence of colonizing organisms. Therefore, it may be unreliable and it not recommended. In addition, some true pathogens may be sufficiently fastidious and therefore recovery from superficial culture is difficult, e.g., anaerobes
  - An organism can be obtained in up to 75% of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis cases.​[[2]](#Woods2021) There is a similar yield of positive cultures collected by invasive diagnostic procedures when obtained within 24–48 hours after initiation of antibacterial therapy compared to prior to administration of antibacterials. This may become an increasingly important test, as resistant organisms such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) play a greater role in acute osteomyelitis.​[[4]](#c0096n00132) Early consultation with an orthopedic surgeon is recommended
- Imaging:

  - *Note*: If the clinical findings suggest osteomyelitis, an MRI or bone scan is not required to start treatment so long as appropriate cultures (i.e., blood cultures, surgical samples) have been obtained
  - X-ray imaging is not sufficiently sensitive to rule out osteomyelitis, but it is an important noninvasive and easily accessible test to assess other etiologies of limb pain. Radiographs may be normal initially, as rarefaction of bone is visible only once there is 50% loss of bone density (seen earlier in neonates, later in older children and adults). Bony changes (e.g., periosteal reaction, osteolysis) are usually not evident until at least 10 days after the onset of infection. In a person with a diabetic foot infection, chronic osteopathy may complicate radiographic interpretation (for more information, see Diabetic Foot Infections)
  - Ultrasound is unable to evaluate bone marrow and is thus of limited utility in diagnosing osteomyelitis. As an adjunct, it is useful for visualizing soft tissue abscesses, subperiosteal collections and joint effusions (findings that require surgical intervention) and can aid in aspiration of soft tissue fluid or joint fluid
  - MRI is a highly sensitive modality of imaging, especially when it is necessary to define the location and extent of infection and extraosseous complications such as periosteal abscesses. It has the advantage of assessing bone, joint and soft tissue simultaneously while also sparing the patient ionizing radiation.​[[5]](#c0096n00199) However, where MRI accessibility is limited, its use in the investigation of an acute uncomplicated presentation is not routine; in such cases, a CT scan should be considered
  - Bone scan: imaging using technetium 99m-labelled methylene diphosphonate has improved early diagnosis and offers similar sensitivity and specificity to MRI when paired with a gallium or white blood cell scan. However, it is less specific, as other causes of enhanced bone turnover (e.g., fracture or tumor) will also give a positive result. In the neuropathic foot, small stress fractures may be difficult to detect clinically or radiographically, but still show uptake on the bone scan. Vascular insufficiency may attenuate changes on the bone scan. A negative bone scan does not rule out osteomyelitis.​[[6]](#c0096n00023) In neonates, an x-ray may be more reliable​[[7]](#c0096n00184)

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0096n00007) outlines the management of acute osteomyelitis.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Surgical Drainage

Antibacterials do not penetrate well into collections of pus or into bone in which blood supply is compromised by infection; therefore, a combined antimicrobial and surgical approach should be considered in all cases. Surgical decompression and exploration may be necessary when the patient is septic or clinically unstable, there has been a delay in presentation or diagnosis (i.e., to confirm microbiological etiology when causative organism may be less clear), pus has been found on aspiration, surrounding abscesses are present, or when imaging reveals evidence of bone destruction or sequestrum formation. For early disease, the role of immediate surgery has been controversial.​[[6]](#c0096n00023) However, if swelling, pain, tenderness and fever do not improve within a few days after starting antibacterials, consider surgical exploration, especially if initial empiric therapy did not cover MRSA. Suspicion of osteomyelitis secondary to a penetrating injury (e.g., to the calcaneus) requires bone exploration, débridement and culture. Osteomyelitis associated with diabetic foot infection (see Diabetic Foot Infections) often requires surgical débridement. This should be aggressive and may involve amputation of the infected limb/digit.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Antibacterials

If clinically possible, suggest delaying the start of antimicrobials until microbiological work-up has been sent, as patients are often stable; however, in pediatric patients, treatment should not be delayed beyond 48–72 hours to avoid complications.​[[2]](#Woods2021)​[[8]](#YeoARamachandranM.AcuteHaematogenou-AFC1C2A1)​[[9]](#FaustSNClarkJPallettEtAl.ManagingBo-AFC1DF2B) Once cultures are pending, start empiric IV antibacterial therapy based on the most likely infecting organism (see [Table 1](#c0096n00003)). Generally, these infections are monomicrobial; therefore, empiric coverage should include activity against S. aureus. Some experts suggest empirically covering for MRSA if local prevalence of invasive staphylococcal infections is ≥10–20%.​[[2]](#Woods2021)​[[12]](#c0096n00183) A definitive choice can be made once the organism and sensitivities are identified (see [Table 2](#c0096n00013)).

The role of rifampin as an adjunctive antibacterial has not been rigorously studied in the setting of uncomplicated acute osteomyelitis (i.e., nonvertebral osteomyelitis, not involving a diabetic foot infection, no associated hardware). Furthermore, rifampin should not be used alone for staphylococcal infections because resistance develops rapidly.

Subacute presentations, infections associated with prosthetic material, immunocompromised hosts, and fungal and mycobacterial etiologies warrant consultation with an infectious diseases specialist as the empiric coverage may differ significantly.

**Table 1:** Initial Empiric Antibacterial Therapy for Acute Osteomyelitis​​[[a]](#afn17349)

| Source | Characteristics | Usual Causative Organisms | Empiric IV Antibacterials |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hematogenous Osteomyelitis | Most common type Predominant in children and adults >50 y Bloodborne bacteria lodge in bone as nidus of infection Possible in any bone but usually in long bones: femur 36%, tibia 33%, humerus 10%​ [9] Vertebral osteomyelitis not uncommon in adults. Predisposing factors are IV drug use, trauma, recent bacteremia, other source of infection, e.g., urinary tract, endocarditis In young children (<18 months) , septic arthritis often coexists​ [8] | Neonates: group B streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus ​ [10] Children: S. aureus ( MSSA & MRSA ​ [b] ), group A streptococci, Kingella kingae (children <3 y) ​ [8] ​ [9] Rare: Haemophilus influenzae ,​ [c] S. pneumoniae , gram-negative enteric bacteria Adults: S. aureus , gram-negative enteric bacteria Sickle cell disease: Salmonella spp. (especially in Europe, USA), S. aureus ​ [11] | Neonates: if MRSA unlikely, cloxacillin​ [d] + cefotaxime (to cover gram-negative enteric bacilli); if MRSA possible, vancomycin + cefotaxime or ceftriaxone Consider meningitic doses of antimicrobials if there is a possibility of concomitant meningitis; for more information, see Bacterial Meningitis Children: if MRSA unlikely, cloxacillin​ [d] or cefazolin ; if MRSA possible, add vancomycin. Replace cefazolin with cefotaxime if not immunized against H. influenzae Adults: if MRSA unlikely, cloxacillin​ [d] or cefazolin; if MRSA possible, add vancomycin |
| Spread from Contiguous Sites ​ [b] ​ [e] | Spread from head/neck | Often polymicrobial: S. aureus , anaerobes, gram-negative organisms | All ages : IV amoxicillin/clavulanate or ceftriaxone + metronidazole |
| Spread from soft tissue infection | S. aureus , streptococci May be polymicrobial in the setting of vascular insufficiency and diabetic foot infection | All ages : cloxacillin​ [d] or cefazolin; consider IV amoxicillin/clavulanate or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole if polymicrobial; if MRSA possible, add vancomycin |
| Spread from genitourinary system | Often polymicrobial; gram-negative enteric bacilli, potential for necrotizing infections with anaerobes Rare in children | All ages : IV amoxicillin/clavulanate. Alternative: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin) and consider adding metronidazole Alternative: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam) |
| Penetrating Trauma | Example: puncture wound of foot. Does not include animal or human bite wounds. Consider discussion with infectious disease specialist | Pseudomonas aeruginosa , skin organisms ( S. aureus , Streptococci ) May be polymicrobial | Children: cloxacillin​ [d] or cefazolin plus ceftazidime; Alternative: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam) Adults: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam), or cefazolin and ciprofloxacin |

[a] The site and origin of infection and organism responsible are largely related to age.

[b] [MRSA](#c0096n00137) is increasing in importance as a cause of acute osteomyelitis.

[c] H. influenzae is of decreasing importance due to success of immunization. However, it should be considered in those who are unimmunized or living in an area where invasive H. influenzaecases are more common.

[d] A semisynthetic, penicillinase-resistant penicillin (e.g., cloxacillin) provides coverage against S. aureus and streptococci. It can cause vein irritation, especially in young children.

[e] Common in elderly; predisposing factors include surgery and soft tissue infection.

### Duration of Antibacterial Therapy

A maximum duration of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy is recommended for acute osteomyelitis without retained hardware (including vertebral osteomyelitis).​[[15]](#Spellberg2022)​[[16]](#InfectiousDiseasesSocietyOfAmericaI-AFC748F1) In the setting of uncomplicated and débrided osteomyelitis, including the vast majority of pediatric cases, a 4–week duration is usually recommended.​[[2]](#Woods2021)​[[15]](#Spellberg2022) More severe initial presentation, extensive bone involvement, slow resolution of systemic and local signs, and infection with more resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA) may necessitate a 6-week course. In osteomyelitis following penetrating injury, 10–14 days of treatment is sufficient if adequate débridement has been performed.

Therapy can often be completed with oral antibiotics (see [Sequential IV-Oral Antibacterial Therapy](#c0096n00014)). However, for those requiring prolonged intravenous therapy, home IV therapy programs are an option for shortening hospital stay. Nursing resources to attend to the patient at their home, the type of home IV pumps used, or the availability of an infusion centre in a region may limit specific treatment options, especially regarding frequency of doses and stability of reconstituted antibiotics.

Shorter regimens of antibacterial therapy explored in a Finnish pediatric trial suggest a total treatment course of 20 days.​[[17]](#c0096n00182) However, with the rise of CA-MRSA, an argument can be made that the longer, more conservative treatment courses are still appropriate in the North American setting.​[[12]](#c0096n00183)​[[18]](#PeltolaHPxe4xe4kkxf6nenM.AcuteOsteo-7B32522B)

### Sequential IV-Oral Antibacterial Therapy

Since a long course of antibacterial therapy is required for the treatment of acute osteomyelitis, a switch from the IV to the oral route has many advantages, including reduced complications from IV cannulae and lower cost, without compromising efficacy.​[[18]](#PeltolaHPxe4xe4kkxf6nenM.AcuteOsteo-7B32522B)​[[19]](#c0096n00194)​[[20]](#ZaoutisTLocalioARLeckermanKEtAl.Pro-7B32480A)​[[21]](#LeSauxNHowardABarrowmanNJ.ShorterCo-7B324C51)​[[22]](#RuebnerRKerenRCoffinSEtAl.Complicat-7B324F8A)​[[23]](#KerenRShahSSSrivastavaREtAl.Compara-AFC6E2A5)​[[24]](#OVIVA-ECA6E56D)

Numerous RCTs support the use of oral therapy in patients who are clinically stable, have adequate source control, are likely to absorb oral medications and have no psychosocial reasons that preclude the safe use of oral therapy.​[[15]](#Spellberg2022) There is no required minimum duration of IV lead-in,​[[15]](#Spellberg2022) though systemic improvement, resolution of fever, and resolution of local signs of inflammation and tenderness may take several days.​[[25]](#LeSaux2018) In the pediatric patient, laboratory markers (i.e., CRP) are also used to guide the transition from IV to oral therapy.​[[25]](#LeSaux2018) These recommendations would not apply to neonates or those with an underlying immunodeficiency.

An appropriate oral antibiotic regimen should be undertaken with the following principles:

- Absence of any GI issues that will interfere with medication absorption
- The dose of oral antibacterial is larger than that usually used for minor infections and the drug has good oral bioavailability (see [Table 3](#c0096n00017))
- Adherence is vital; if treatment fails, chronic osteomyelitis may develop. For children, the taste of the oral antibacterial is an important factor (e.g., cloxacillin liquid preparations are unpalatable while cephalexin has a more acceptable taste). Psychosocial issues that may affect adherence also need to be explored
- If no organism was isolated but the patient has recovered well on the empiric IV regimen, a switch to oral antibacterial therapy (with a similar spectrum of activity) can still be made
- Recurrence of symptoms while on oral step-down therapy demands immediate reassessment and strong consideration for resumption of prior IV antibacterials.

### Follow-Up

Success of treatment is judged clinically by careful follow-up of systemic signs (fever and well-being), local signs of decreasing inflammation and tenderness, and return of full function. ESR gradually returns to normal over several weeks; CRP may return to normal in a matter of days. In cases of vertebral osteomyelitis, it has been recommended to consider monitoring inflammatory markers after approximately 4 weeks of therapy.​[[16]](#InfectiousDiseasesSocietyOfAmericaI-AFC748F1)

It is not recommended to routinely pursue follow-up imaging (i.e., MRI) for acute osteomyelitis once a patient has made an appropriate clinical recovery following adequate therapy. There is poor correlation between clinical response and MRI/CT/nuclear studies; radiologic resolution may lag.​[[26]](#LeisJAEvansGACiccotelliWEtAl.Choosi-AFC7A8C6)

### Therapeutic Tips

- The consequences of treating osteomyelitis empirically with what turns out to be the wrong antibiotic can be dire. In an era of increasing incidence of CA-MRSA (as well as other antibiotic resistant organisms), early consultation with a surgeon to obtain pus for microbiologic testing by aspirating the bone at the time of presentation in addition to blood cultures allows for an accurate microbiologic diagnosis and tailored antibiotic therapy.
- A long course of antibacterial therapy is required for microbiological cure, even in the case of acute and uncomplicated osteomyelitis.
- Oral step-down therapy is appropriate for the majority of patients, as it reduces hospital stay, reduces complications related to long-term IV cannulae and still assures cure.
