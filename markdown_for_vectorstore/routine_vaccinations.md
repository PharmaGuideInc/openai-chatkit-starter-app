### Introduction

Vaccination is regarded as one of the most successful public health interventions, having contributed to the eradication of smallpox globally and toward the elimination of rubella and polio in Canada.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) Other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with low-level incidence in Canada attributed to vaccination include tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, mumps and invasive meningococcal disease.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) Currently, routine vaccination rates remain below target across many VPDs,​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) leaving numerous communities at risk of outbreaks. For example, among children <2 years of age, vaccination rates for *H. influenzae* type b, tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis, and varicella are below the 95% target established by the National Immunization Strategy, at 74%, 78% and 83%, respectively.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) As such, vaccination has been identified as a priority for public health efforts across Canada.​[[2]](#PanCan-B9D5E375)

Vaccination of infants and children is important, as they are particularly susceptible to VPDs and their complications. While innate immune function is established relatively soon after birth, T cell function is established more slowly.​[[3]](#SimonAK-BBD92A0F) Furthermore, while memory B cells are generated in infancy, humoral immune responses are blunted.

Young children become susceptible to infection as passively shared antibodies acquired during gestation decline with time; [Figure 1](#AntibodiesWithTime) depicts infant neutralizing antibody levels during the pre- and postpartum phases and into childhood. Through both vaccination and natural exposure, immune function is strengthened; however, these responses may wane over time, requiring booster doses to maintain the protection offered through vaccination.

This chapter presents indications and dosing schedules based on recommendations made by the [National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci.html) or published in the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-immunization-guide.html) ​[[5]](#PHAC_CanadianImmuniz-BBDF04D4) or product monographs. However, vaccine schedules are implemented at the provincial/territorial level and may differ from national recommendations; for more information, see the provincial/territorial schedules for vaccination of infants and children (available from the [Government of Canada’s website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information/provincial-territorial-routine-vaccination-programs-infants-children.html)).

This chapter addresses routine childhood vaccinations that are offered in Canada, such as those against diphtheria, H. influenzae type b, measles, mumps, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, poliomyelitis, rubella and tetanus. This chapter does *not* include information on vaccines discussed in other chapters or those for travel purposes. For more information related to these indications, see:

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent vaccine-preventable disease by:

  - Direct protection through vaccination of eligible individuals
  - Reduced spread to individuals who cannot be vaccinated or who may mount an insufficient immune response following vaccination
- Reduce the severity of breakthrough infections with organisms responsible for vaccine-preventable diseases
- Prevent morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases, e.g., adverse events, antimicrobial resistance following treatment of infections that could be averted through vaccination​[[6]](#Kim-BBD9D3D9)
- Prevent mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases

### Investigations

Prior to each vaccination, providers should attempt to obtain a current and complete vaccination history. This history can be collated from a variety of sources including an immunization registry (as available), paper records held by the patient or their caregiver, medical records from other health-care providers, pharmacy dispensing records, and smartphone applications (e.g., [CANImmunize](https://www.canimmunize.ca/en/home)). For children, the Canadian Immunization Guide states that “parental recall of prior immunization, in the absence of documentation from the vaccine provider, correlates poorly with vaccines received and should not be accepted as evidence of immunization”;​[[7]](#CIG_InadImmuniz-BBD9D87B) influenza vaccination is a potential exception. In the absence of complete vaccination records, individuals should be considered unimmunized and therefore initiated on a vaccine schedule appropriate for their age and risk factors. Routine serologic testing is not recommended.​[[7]](#CIG_InadImmuniz-BBD9D87B)

General investigations to determine the appropriateness of vaccination and whether there is a need for a modified schedule or additional doses based on risk factors should include:

- Reactions to prior vaccines, including the nature and severity of the reaction
- Allergies that may impact vaccination (e.g., latex). Allergic reactions to foods including apple, avocado, banana, carrot, celery, chestnut, kiwi, melon, papaya, potato or tomato may be indicative of a latex allergy;​[[8]](#Nucera-BBD9E66F) however, allergies to other foods such as egg, yeast, gelatin and casein from cow’s milk rarely translate to allergy to vaccines containing these substances​[[9]](#Buyantseva-DCBCE632)
- History of hepatitis B vaccination at birth. Infants whose birthing parent is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are recommended to receive 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (at birth, 1 month and 6 months of age) if they weigh ≥2000 grams at birth, and 4 doses (at birth, 1 month, 2 months and 6 months of age) if they weigh <2000 grams at birth​[[10]](#CIG_Premie-BBDA1C7C)​[[11]](#Castillo)
- Presence of primary immunodeficiency or secondary/acquired immunodeficiency due to medical conditions or use of immunosuppressive therapy
- Functional or anatomic asplenia, due to elevated risk of infection from encapsulated bacteria including H. influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)
- Cochlear implant recipients, due to elevated risk of bacterial meningitis and otitis media due to influenza, S. pneumoniae or Hib​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)
- Recent immigration status, due to risk of hepatitis A or B for those from countries endemic for these viruses and the potential for incomplete vaccination records or the receipt of vaccine products or regimens that differ from those in Canada​[[13]](#CIG_Immigration)
- Liver disease, due to elevated risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and more rapid progression of hepatitis A or B in those with chronic liver disease from another cause​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)
- Sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies, due to elevated risk of infection with hepatitis B due to repeated transfusions of blood or blood products​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)
- Neurologic conditions that may impair clearance of oral secretions, due to increased risk of hospitalization with influenza and predisposition to pneumococcal infections​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)
- Congenital heart disease, due to increased risk of complications from influenza and RSV​[[14]](#CIG_Influenza)​[[15]](#CIG_RSV)
- Endocrine conditions such as diabetes mellitus, due to increased risk of influenza-related complications​[[14]](#CIG_Influenza)
- Chronic respiratory conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD), due to increased risk of complications from influenza, pneumococcal and varicella infection​[[12]](#CIG_ChronicDx)

### Tetanus

Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is caused by a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, with spores widely distributed in soil worldwide. Transmission most commonly occurs through direct contact of a wound with soil, animal or human feces, or dust, and not through person-to-person contact.​[[16]](#PHAC_Tetanus-BBDC387A) This neurotoxin causes muscle spasms that begin in the jaw muscles and cause an inability to open the mouth (trismus or lockjaw) before descending to the throat, where it can cause dysphagia, and to the trunk, where it can cause aspiration and airway obstruction. Autonomic instability may also occur.​[[17]](#CookTM-BBDC4ECC) Case fatality ranges from 10–80%, especially among infants and older adults.​[[16]](#PHAC_Tetanus-BBDC387A)

Tetanus is considered to have low-level incidence in Canada, with an average annual incidence of 0.01 cases per 100 000 population, corresponding to a 95% reduction in cases since the introduction of tetanus vaccination.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) However, vaccination against tetanus remains critical, given its endemicity and environmental spread. Since it is not spread through person-to-person transmission, herd immunity cannot be established, and since it is caused by a toxin rather than the bacteria itself, infection itself does not confer immunity.​[[16]](#PHAC_Tetanus-BBDC387A)

In Canada, tetanus toxoid is available only as a component of combination vaccines containing diphtheria, acellular pertussis, poliomyelitis, H. influenzae type b and/or hepatitis B. Completion of a 3-dose primary series results in protective antibody titers among at least 99% of vaccine recipients. While recent evidence suggests that antibody responses to tetanus decline with an estimated half-life of 14 years,​[[18]](#Hammarlund-BBDC63CE) revaccination at 10-year intervals remains recommended until a comprehensive review of the literature has been completed.​[[16]](#PHAC_Tetanus-BBDC387A)

Vaccines available in Canada against tetanus can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Diphtheria

Diphtheria is caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria following contact with infected respiratory droplets or cutaneous lesions.​[[19]](#Truelove-BBDA2E9B) Among those who are unvaccinated when infected, 30% become asymptomatic carriers while 70% experience symptoms; among those who are vaccinated when infected, 90% become asymptomatic carriers while 10% experience symptoms.​[[19]](#Truelove-BBDA2E9B) Symptoms include mild fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise and anorexia.​[[20]](#PHAC_Diphtheria-BBDAA74C) Approximately 80% of those who develop symptoms progress to membranous diphtheria, which has a 5–50% mortality rate.​[[19]](#Truelove-BBDA2E9B) Symptoms of membranous diphtheria include the development of an adherent, asymmetrical, greyish-white membrane on the tonsils and oropharynx.​[[20]](#PHAC_Diphtheria-BBDAA74C) Death from asphyxia can occur (due to airway obstruction) as well as potentially fatal toxic cardiomyopathy or neurological disorders such as hypoesthesia, polyneuropathy and cranial neuropathies.​[[19]](#Truelove-BBDA2E9B)

The average annual incidence rate of diphtheria in Canada is 0.014 cases per 100 000 population, or approximately 5 cases per year, which represents an over 99% decline in annual incidence versus the prevaccine era.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) Diphtheria vaccines stimulate the production of antibodies against the diphtheria toxoid. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic and severe disease increases with the number of doses received (e.g., effectiveness against severe disease ranges from 47% after 1–2 doses to 81% following full vaccination with ≥3 doses). This immunity wanes over time, with the proportion of individuals with fully protective antibody levels declining by 0.6% per year since vaccination.​[[19]](#Truelove-BBDA2E9B)

In Canada, all vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid are available only as a component of combination vaccines, with the amount of diphtheria toxoid contained varying by product.​[[20]](#PHAC_Diphtheria-BBDAA74C) Products with higher concentrations of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunization of infants and children <7 years of age and denoted by an upper case “D,” while those with lower concentrations are used as booster doses and denoted by a lower case “d.” Products containing a lower concentration (d) may be used as a booster dose to children 4 to <7 years of age and are the recommended product for older children, adolescents and adults. Diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine is recommended for routine infant immunization starting at 2 months of age.​[[20]](#PHAC_Diphtheria-BBDAA74C)

Vaccines available in Canada against diphtheria can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Pertussis

Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis and is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever and mild cough, followed 1–2 weeks later by rapid coughing that ends with a characteristic whoop upon inspiration and may be severe enough to result in vomiting. This whoop is often absent among infants <6 months of age and in teenagers and adults. Cough and posttussive vomiting may also be absent in young infants who are instead at risk of apnea. Complications of pertussis in infants include death, respiratory failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, subdural or conjunctival bleeding, and encephalopathy, while adolescents may experience rib fractures, subconjunctival hemorrhage, rectal prolapse, or urinary incontinence secondary to coughing.​[[21]](#PHAC_Pertussis-BBDBA356)

Routine vaccination in Canada has been associated with a 95% decline in incidence of pertussis to an annual average of 8 cases per 100 000 population. Vaccination remains important, as pertussis is endemic with peaks in incident cases occurring every 2–5 years.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) Each year, 1–3 deaths related to pertussis occur in Canada, primarily in unimmunized or underimmunized infants under 6 months of age.​[[21]](#PHAC_Pertussis-BBDBA356)

In Canada, all vaccines against pertussis are available only as a component of combination vaccines, with the amount of acellular pertussis antigen present varying by product. Products with higher concentrations are designated as “aP” and are primarily used in those <7 years of age, while those with lower concentrations designated as “ap” are used as booster doses in children 4 to <7 years of age, in adolescents and in adults. Completion of the primary series is associated with vaccine efficacy of 85%, which increases to 90% following booster immunization.​[[21]](#PHAC_Pertussis-BBDBA356) A single dose of pertussis vaccine is also recommended during each pregnancy, as it has been shown to provide protection for the newborn; it should ideally be administered between 27–32 weeks’ gestation (although it may be provided anytime between 13 weeks’ gestation and delivery).​[[22]](#PHAC_TdapPregnancyl-BBDBDAB6)

Vaccines available in Canada against pertussis can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Pneumococcal Disease

Streptococcus pneumoniae is spread through direct oral contact or contact with respiratory droplets, or secretions from a person who is either infected or colonized with the bacterium.​[[23]](#PHAC_Pneu) Up to 20–60% of healthy children are asymptomatic carriers.​[[24]](#PHAC_IPD) Infection can lead to bronchitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, otitis media or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), which can include bacteremia or meningitis. Pneumococci cause 50% of all cases of bacterial meningitis in Canada, with an 8% case fatality rate among children. Survivors of pneumococcal meningitis may experience permanent neurologic sequelae.​[[23]](#PHAC_Pneu) Of over 100 serotypes of S. pneumoniae identified worldwide,​[[25]](#NACI-3A7B84BE) 15 serotypes are responsible for most cases, although implicated serotypes have been found to differ by age and by serotype coverage with available vaccines.​[[24]](#PHAC_IPD)

Vaccine effectiveness data is not yet available for the 15-valent (Pneu-C-15) or 20-valent (Pneu-C-20) pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, as their approval was based on comparative immunogenicity data against Pneu-C-13.​[[25]](#NACI-3A7B84BE) In children <5 years of age, Pneu-C-13 has 67–96% effectiveness against IPD when caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine, and 20–77% effectiveness against pneumonia.​[[23]](#PHAC_Pneu)

Pneu-C-15 or Pneu-C-20 are recommended for children without additional risk factors for IPD, while Pneu-C-20 should be used for those with medical or environmental risk factors (as specified in the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-16-pneumococcal-vaccine.html)). This applies to routine use beginning in infancy, catch-up schedules and completion of vaccine series initiated with other pneumococcal vaccines.​[[23]](#PHAC_Pneu)

Vaccines available in Canada against pneumococcus can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Poliomyelitis

Poliovirus is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route with shedding in the feces persisting for 3–6 weeks after infection; respiratory spread may also occur. Approximately 75% of those infected are asymptomatic. Mild illness may present with fever, fatigue, headache or vomiting, with more severe disease presenting with muscle pain and stiffness of the neck and back. Paralysis occurs in less than 1% of cases; however, it is associated with 2–5% mortality among affected children and 15–30% of affected adults.​[[26]](#PHAC_Polio-BBDC004E)

As a result of vaccination, endemic poliomyelitis (also known as polio) has been eliminated in Canada with no cases reported from 2015–2019.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805) Until eradication has been achieved globally, vaccination remains important to protect against imported polio.

Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines are available either as combination vaccines or as a single, polio-only vaccine; they provide protection against all 3 types of poliovirus. Combination vaccines are administered via the intramuscular route while the polio-only vaccine is given subcutaneously. Immunity is achieved in over 95% of vaccine recipients following 3 doses and in close to 100% following a booster dose.​[[26]](#PHAC_Polio-BBDC004E) While the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine remains widely used internationally due to its lower cost and easier administration, its use in Canada was discontinued in 1994 due to its association with paralytic polio among recipients.​[[27]](#PolioOutbreak-BBDC1BA4)

Vaccines available in Canada against poliomyelitis can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Haemophilus influenzae Type B

H. influenzae type b (Hib) is a gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact with nasal or throat discharge.​[[28]](#PHAC_Hib-BBDAC923) The bacteria may colonize the nasopharynx, with invasive disease possible when experiencing a concurrent upper respiratory tract infection.​[[29]](#HowardAJ-BBDAFFB0)​[[30]](#TakalaAK-BBDB174D) About 55–65% of children affected by invasive disease develop meningitis (5% mortality rate) and 10–15% experience other severe neurologic sequelae.​[[28]](#PHAC_Hib-BBDAC923) Epiglottitis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis and otitis media are also disease manifestations. Hib is the most common cause of epiglottitis in children, which is a serious and potentially fatal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and occasionally emergency intubation in response to airway obstruction.​[[31]](#Glynn-3A80FB60)

Invasive disease due to Hib has declined by 99% among children <5 years of age in Canada following the introduction of vaccination; the current annual average incidence rate is 0.3 cases per 100 000 population, or approximately 16 cases per year.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805)

Hib-containing vaccines consist of the type b capsular polysaccharide conjugated with tetanus toxoid; however, the amount of tetanus toxoid present should not be considered to offer protection against tetanus disease. Completion of the vaccine series is estimated to result in clinical efficacy of 95–100% among most children, although efficacy among immunodeficient individuals is unknown. Vaccination is recommended beginning at 2 months of age and is not routinely indicated in children ≥5 years of age, since case counts after this age are very low (due to the acquisition of natural immunity). Exceptions to this are vaccination of those age ≥5 years who are at increased risk of invasive disease (e.g., asplenia/hyposplenism, cochlear implant, immunodeficiency).​[[28]](#PHAC_Hib-BBDAC923)

Vaccines available in Canada against Hib can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Hepatitis B

For information related to hepatitis B, see Viral Hepatitis, Acute.

### Measles, Mumps and Rubella

#### Transmission, Clinical Presentation and Complications

- **Measles:** This highly contagious virus is transmitted by the airborne route, respiratory droplets or contact with nasal or throat secretions of those who are infected. Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children, a group that also has the greatest burden of measles severity and complications. It presents with fever, malaise and anorexia, which are followed by respiratory symptoms (nasal congestion, conjunctivitis and cough). Koplik spots (whitish, greyish or bluish spots on the inner lining of the mouth) then develop, followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities. Complications may include otitis media or pneumonia (10% of cases) and encephalitis (0.1% of cases), with pneumonia and encephalitis potentially being fatal.​[[32]](#PHAC_Measles-BBDB31DC)
- **Mumps:** Mumps virus is spread primarily via large droplets, although transmission may also occur via direct contact with infected respiratory secretions or saliva.​[[33]](#PHAC_Mumps-BBDB4A5C) Initial symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue and anorexia may be followed by acute parotitis (bilateral in 75% of cases) among approximately 40% of those infected. Orchitis and oophoritis may occur in 20–30% and 5% of postpubertal patients, respectively; these conditions may be associated with subfertility, although sterility is rare.​[[34]](#Hviid-BBDB5CE5) Complications of mumps infection can also include meningoencephalitis and subsequent paralysis, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus and hearing impairment.​[[33]](#PHAC_Mumps-BBDB4A5C)
- **Rubella** (also known as German measles): Rubella virus is transmitted by droplets, direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of infected individuals as well as transplacentally to a fetus, causing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is estimated that up to 50% of rubella infections are subclinical. Symptoms, if any, are often nonspecific and can include rash, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia or low-grade fever. In pregnancy, CRS can result in elevated risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or other manifestations such as deafness, cataracts and cardiac disease in the infant, with the highest risk associated with infection in the first trimester.​[[35]](#PHAC_Rubella-BBDB8A91)

#### Burden of Disease and Impact of Vaccination

- **Measles:** Routine vaccination against measles in Canada has been associated with an over 99% reduction in annual incidence to a current average of 0.2 cases per 100 000 population. Over 90% of measles cases in Canada are directly imported from abroad or through direct exposure to an imported case; however, outbreaks and local transmission can occur. Given its high transmissibility, 95% vaccination coverage is required for community protection (herd immunity).​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805)
- **Mumps:** While routine vaccination has reduced the incidence of mumps in Canada by over 99% to approximately 2 cases per 100 000 population annually, cyclical outbreaks recur every 2–5 years, with recent outbreaks mainly involving adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15–29.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805)
- **Rubella:** Following the implementation of routine vaccination against rubella across all provinces and territories in 1983, incidence rates have declined by over 99%, with rubella considered to be eliminated in Canada. Similarly, incidences of CRS and congenital rubella infection (CRI) have declined by 98%, with no reported cases of CRS/CRI due to rubella exposure in Canada since 2000.​[[1]](#GOC-B9D56805)

#### Vaccine Availability, Efficacy and Tolerability

In Canada, all vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella are combination products with or without varicella and are live vaccines administered by the subcutaneous route. Efficacy against measles following a single dose is 85–95% and approaches 100% with a second dose, while effectiveness against mumps is 62–91% following a single dose and 76–95% following 2 doses. Serologic evidence of immunity against rubella has been identified among at least 95% of vaccine recipients after a single dose, with cellular and humoral immunity persisting for at least 20 years after vaccination.​[[32]](#PHAC_Measles-BBDB31DC) Routine immunization is currently recommended to begin at 12 months of age, as passive immunization from the birthing parent is believed to provide protection for the first year; however, evidence of waning immunity over this period exists.​[[36]](#Leuridan-3A832712) Vaccination can be provided as young as 6 months of age for children travelling to areas at risk of exposure; however, any doses given before 12 months of age are not counted toward the routine immunization schedule.​[[32]](#PHAC_Measles-BBDB31DC)

Adverse events following immunization occur at greater frequency and severity with the first dose than with subsequent doses. The rubella component of the combination vaccines is also associated with acute transient arthritis or arthralgia that is most common in postpubertal females. Measles-like, rubella-like or varicella-like rash may also develop following vaccination in up to 10% of recipients. Although the vaccines are produced in chick embryo cell culture, they are considered safe for those with anaphylactic reaction to eggs, as the trace amounts of egg or chicken protein in the vaccine is insufficient to trigger an allergic reaction.​[[32]](#PHAC_Measles-BBDB31DC)

Vaccines available in Canada against measles, mumps and rubella can be found in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations).

### Varicella

For information related to varicella, see Herpesvirus Infections.

### Vaccine Hesitancy

A comprehensive discussion regarding vaccine hesitancy is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, [Immunize Canada](https://immunize.ca/counselling-public) has collated resources for health-care providers.

A patient-friendly infographic is available in the “Information for the Patient” section.

### Deviations from Schedule

In general, interruption of an immunization series for a routine vaccine does not require restarting the vaccine series, regardless of the interval between doses.​[[37]](#PHAC_ImmunizSched_BBDCA527) The only exceptions are for the oral cholera and travellers’ diarrhea vaccines and the rabies vaccine when used for postexposure prophylaxis.​[[38]](#PHAC_TimingVax-BBDCE5E6) Individuals with interrupted immunization schedules should be vaccinated to complete the appropriate schedule for their current age.​[[37]](#PHAC_ImmunizSched_BBDCA527)

Minimum ages and intervals between doses exist to ensure an adequate immune response is achieved.​[[38]](#PHAC_TimingVax-BBDCE5E6) In general, doses given before the recommended age should be repeated on or after the date when the person reaches this minimum age, and doses given off-schedule should be administered late rather than early. For minimum age and minimum time intervals between doses in healthy children, see [Table 2](#Schedules).​[[38]](#PHAC_TimingVax-BBDCE5E6)

**Table 2:** Minimum Age and Dose Intervals​​[[a]](#afn28974)[[38]](#PHAC_TimingVax-BBDCE5E6)

| Vaccine | Minimum Age | Minimum Interval BetweenDoses 1 and 2 | Minimum Interval BetweenDoses 2 and 3 | Minimum Interval BetweenDoses 3 and 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib ( Infanrix hexa ) or DTaP-IPV-Hib ( Infanrix-IPV/Hib , Pediacel ) | 6 wk | 4 wk | 4 wk | 6 months |
| MMR ( M-M-R II , Priorix ) | 6 months​ [b] | 4 wk | N/A | N/A |
| MMRV ( Priorix-Tetra ) | 9 months​ [b] |
| MMRV ( ProQuad ) | 12 months |

[a] For all vaccines discussed in this chapter but not present in this table, minimum age and dose intervals are based on the information provided in [Table 4](#dt_routineVaccinations) and in individual product monographs.

[b] While vaccination can be offered at this age for children travelling outside of Canada where measles is of concern or where an outbreak is occurring, any doses given before 12 months of age will not count toward completion of the immunization series and will have to be repeated once the child is ≥12 months of age.​[[32]](#PHAC_Measles-BBDB31DC)

### Vaccine Product Interchangeability

Ideally, the same manufacturer’s product should be used for all doses in a vaccine series, since differences between manufacturers’ production methods, antigen contents, adjuvants, conjugating proteins or other additives may theoretically impact interchangeability. However, vaccination should not be deferred due to unavailability of a specific product.​[[39]](#PHAC_VaxInterchangeabilityl-BBDCEAF6)

For each indication discussed in this chapter, vaccine product interchangeability is acceptable based on expert opinion discussed in the vaccine-specific chapters of the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines).​[[5]](#PHAC_CanadianImmuniz-BBDF04D4)

### Administering Multiple Injections

- Coadministration of vaccines is recommended to increase the probability that the individual will be fully immunized. The vaccines discussed in this chapter can safely and effectively be coadministered at the same visit, including all combinations of inactivated and live vaccines. If 2 live vaccines are not administered on the same day, they should be spaced at least 4 weeks apart.​[[38]](#PHAC_TimingVax-BBDCE5E6)
- While it is preferable to administer vaccines across different limbs, multiple injections can be given in the same limb provided they are spaced at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) apart.​[[40]](#PHAC_VaxAdmin-BBDD2969)
- Maximum volumes for a given route and injection site should be adhered to and are addressed in [Table 3](#Volumes).​[[41]](#AHS_ImmunizStandards-BBDD493B)

**Table 3:** Maximum Volumes per Injection Site​[[41]](#AHS_ImmunizStandards-BBDD493B)

| Route | Site | Age | Maximum volume per site |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intramuscular | Vastus lateralis | <12 months | 1.0 mL |
| ≥12 months to preschool | 1.5 mL |
| School age to <15 y | 4.0 mL |
| ≥15 y | 5.0 mL |
| Deltoid | ≥12 months to preschool | 1.0 mL |
| School age to <15 y | 1.5 mL |
| ≥15 y | 2 mL |
| Subcutaneous | Upper outer triceps or anterolateral thigh | All ages | 1.0 mL |
| Intradermal | Flexor surface of forearm | All ages | 0.1 mL |

### Reducing Pain Associated with Vaccination​[[42]](#Taddio_ReducingPain-BBDD7C55)

- Young children should be held during injections. Infant feeding and nonnutritive sucking (e.g., finger, pacifier) can be used at the time of vaccination when applicable.
- Sweet-tasting solutions for oral consumption can be considered for children ≤2 years of age.
- Topical anesthetics (containing lidocaine, prilocaine or tetracaine) applied prior to the injection should be considered. There is no evidence of adverse effect of topical anesthetics on the immune response to vaccines.​[[43]](#Shah_VaccinePain-BBDD98AB) Application times ranging from 20–60 minutes prior to injection are required and vary by product. For information on topical anesthetics, see Acute Pain: Topical and Local Anesthesia.
- Administer vaccines that are known to be painful last, e.g., M-M-R II, Prevnar 13, Prevnar 20.​[[40]](#PHAC_VaxAdmin-BBDD2969)​[[42]](#Taddio_ReducingPain-BBDD7C55)
- Aspiration while administering intramuscular injections is not recommended as it has been associated with more painful injections. Furthermore, the anatomic sites used for injection lack major blood vessels.
- Administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen prior to injection administration to prevent pain is not recommended due to lack of beneficial response.​[[43]](#Shah_VaccinePain-BBDD98AB)
- The CARD (comfort, ask, relax, distract) system can be adopted to improve the vaccination experience.​[[44]](#Taddio_CARD-BBDDAFD1)

### Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization

- Any serious or unexpected adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) should be reported. Expected common events (e.g., injection site reaction, fever) do not need to be reported.
- Early signs of potentially serious reactions (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome) may include rapidly progressive bilateral limb weakness or sensory deficits, facial palsy, or dizziness.​[[45]](#LeonhardSE_GBS-BBDDCA2C)
- A temporal association between immunization and the event is sufficient to initiate a report. A causal relationship does not have to be established in order to report a reaction.
- Procedures for documenting and submitting AEFI reports vary by province/territory;​[[46]](#PHAC_ADRReporting-BBDDF018) for more information, see the Government of Canada’s [Contact information for Adverse Events Following Immunization web page](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/federal-provincial-territorial-contact-information-aefi-related-questions.html).

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

While this chapter is focused on vaccinations for children, vaccination in pregnancy also offers benefits to newborns through the passive transfer of antibodies via the placenta and/or breast milk, especially within the first 6 months of life (when many vaccines are not indicated). Vaccine-specific guidelines include:​[[5]](#PHAC_CanadianImmuniz-BBDF04D4)

- COVID-19: vaccination is *recommended* at any stage during pregnancy (for more information, see COVID-19).
- Influenza: vaccination is *recommended* at any stage during pregnancy (for more information, see Influenza).
- Pertussis: vaccination is *recommended* and is ideally administered at 27–32 weeks’ gestation, although vaccination from 13 weeks through to delivery is both acceptable and beneficial.​[[22]](#PHAC_TdapPregnancyl-BBDBDAB6) As the intent of vaccination in pregnancy is protection of the newborn, pertussis vaccine should be administered during every pregnancy, regardless of the past immunization history of the birthing parent.
- Respiratory syncytial virus: vaccination against RSV may be *considered* in birthing parent in advance of, or during the RSV season and should be administered between 32–36 weeks’ gestation.​[[15]](#CIG_RSV)​[[47]](#AbrysvoPM) No data are available on the efficacy or safety of additional doses administered during subsequent pregnancies. Alternatively, the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab is *recommended* for high-risk infants entering their first RSV season and for those up to 24 months with risk factors for severe RSV entering their second season; for more information, see the [RSV section](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/respiratory-syncytial-virus.html#a5) in the Canadian Immunization Guide.​[[15]](#CIG_RSV)
