### Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is an inflammatory disorder of the skin with an onset usually in early childhood. Patients typically have flares of dermatitis that present as ill-defined patches of erythema, scale and excoriations. Lichenification (thickened skin with increased skin markings often in response to chronic rubbing) may also be present. Significant pruritus and generalized dry skin are usually prominent features. Some children will truly outgrow AD but a proportion of patients will have persistent disease into adulthood.​[[1]](#KimJPChaoLXSimpsonELEtAl.Persistenc-D8D0ABC5) Atopic dermatitis may be associated with other atopic conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and food allergies.

### Goals of Therapy

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, recurring condition without a cure, so the major focus is control of dermatitis, pruritus and dryness. Goals of therapy are:

- Relieve generalized dry skin and pruritus, particularly when they interfere with activities of daily living
- Treat patches of dermatitis to reduce inflammation and pruritus and reduce risk of secondary infection
- Prevent flare-ups caused by environmental irritants
- Promptly treat complications of AD such as secondary bacterial infection (e.g., impetigo) or viral infection (e.g., eczema herpeticum)

### Investigations

- Physical exam may show 1 of the following 3 typical morphologic patterns; however, there can be a wide variation in the distribution of the rash:

  - facial and extensor dermatitis in infants
  - flexural and fold dermatitis in older children
  - prominence of facial and hand dermatitis in adults

Investigations are rarely required for the work-up of classic AD. Bacterial swabs showing moderate or heavy growth of organisms may suggest secondary bacterial infections in resistant patches of dermatitis. However, many patients with AD are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, making swabs with minimal growth difficult to interpret.

### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of AD is presented in [Figure 1](#c0069n00004).

### Prevention

Some early data suggested that daily **moisturizer** application in infants at risk, might reduce the risk of developing AD,​[[2]](#HorimukaiKMoritaKNaritaMEtAl.Applic-5514FA2B)​[[3]](#SimpsonELChalmersJRHanifinJMEtAl.JC-4C2ADBEC) however, large follow-up studies did not confirm this finding.​[[4]](#ChalmersJRHainesRHBradshawLEEtAl.Da-DFF09A85)​[[5]](#SkjervenHORehbinderEMVettukattilREt-DFF0DCB4)

Maternal use of probiotics during pregnancy and maternal and/or infant use during breastfeeding may be helpful in reducing the development of AD in the child.​[[6]](#Cuello-GarciaCABrozekJLFiocchiAEtAl-550F9127)​[[7]](#PanduruMPanduruNMSx103lx103vx103str-99AE3755) Although available evidence shows it is reasonable for a high-risk mother (e.g., one who has another child with AD) to take probiotics pre- and postnatally while breastfeeding (or administer them to her infant orally) in an effort to reduce the risk of her baby developing AD, a specific probiotic, dose or length of time to supplement cannot be recommended due to inconsistency among studies. Most trials used various *Lactobacillus* species. A systematic review found that harms reporting in trials of products that affect the microbiota is lacking or inadequate and more safety data are needed to support the assumption that there is little risk associated with these therapies.​[[8]](#BafetaAKohMRiverosCEtAl.HarmsReport-D8D1EF31)

Evidence is inadequate to be used as a basis for advising women to avoid specific foods during pregnancy or breastfeeding as a means of preventing development of allergic diseases like AD in their children.​[[9]](#KramerMSKakumaR.MaternalDietaryAnti-9BB02FC9)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Evidence suggests that for both children and adults, disease-specific formal patient education programs contribute to the success of treatment.​[[10]](#c0069n00165)​[[11]](#HeratizadehAWerfelTWollenbergAEtAl.-D8D8F952)

Reducing common environmental irritants is very useful; use nonirritating soaps and avoid perfumed products, wool, dry grass and leaves. Other triggers may exist for a given patient and can be reduced if the irritant is consistently found to trigger a flare of AD. For some patients, stress may induce a flare but since many daily stressors are unavoidable, the focus should be on ensuring adequate management.

Although patients with AD are more likely to have food allergies, food ingestion as a causal factor in AD flares is uncommon. A systematic review found reasonable evidence that there was no benefit of dietary interventions in the management of AD.​[[13]](#NankervisHThomasKSDelamereFMEtAl.Wh-D8D99E57) Evidence does not support eliminating cow's milk from the diet to improve AD. Some studies suggest that elimination of eggs might benefit patients with AD who have suspected egg allergy and are sensitized to eggs, but more research is needed.​[[12]](#TaitCGoldmanRD.DietaryExclusionForC-5522FFB3)

Bathing or showering, while often considered a key part of AD skin care, is not strongly supported by evidence to be a necessary step. A meta-analysis found that bathing did not improve the skin condition over a 1‑month time period.​[[14]](#SarreMEMartinLMooteWEtAl.AreBathsDe-55209504) Bathing should be brief (5–10 minutes), the water warm (not hot) and the skin patted dry rather than rubbed aggressively. After bathing, apply moisturizer within 3 minutes of light drying (see [Pharmacologic Choices](#c0069n00023)).

Evidence for the effectiveness of wet wraps (wet bandages applied over moisturizers or medication) is limited and of poor quality,​[[15]](#Gonzxe1lez-Lxf3pezGCeballos-Rodrxed-9BB2CB58) but anecdotally they can be a useful second-line therapy, provided their use is supervised by a physician experienced in this technique. Multiple different approaches are used and complications can occur, such as hypothermia, tissue maceration, infection and excessive absorption of medication.

Occlusion with dry-wrap therapy or through any other means is unnecessary since appropriate topical therapy will lead to rapid healing of lesions.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Patients with AD have abnormal skin barrier function, so they cannot maintain adequate hydration. Frequent use of lubricating skin moisturizers such as petrolatum helps seal in moisture. The clinical benefits of moisturizers in AD are well documented​[[16]](#LindhJDBradleyM.ClinicalEffectivene-552683A0) and they are considered first-line therapy for prevention of flares and treatment of minimal irritation and itch. Even when medication is required, moisturizers should be applied liberally at least once daily and more often in some patients. There is little evidence upon which to base recommendations for order of application when patients are using both topical medications and moisturizers. One study showed that the order of application is not important if both products have cream vehicles,​[[17]](#NgSYBegumSChongSY.DoesOrderOfApplic-5525C1F5) but the general recommendation in other scenarios is to apply medicated treatments directly to the skin with moisturizers over top. There is no reliable evidence that one moisturizer is better than another.​[[18]](#VanZuurenEJFedorowiczZChristensenRE-9F475309) Tips for choosing/using a moisturizer include the following:

- Applying adequate amounts of moisturizer is more important than which moisturizer is chosen.
- The patient should like the feel and smell (to encourage use).
- Ideally, there should be no added fragrance or irritants, e.g., salicylic acid.
- Avoid any product that stings, burns or irritates on contact or makes the AD worse.
- During puberty, patients should choose a noncomedogenic moisturizer for use on the face.
- Application of moisturizers to eczematous skin can cause irritation (despite being tolerated on intact skin); reduce this risk by promptly treating active dermatitis appropriately with medicated products.
- The product should fit the patient's budget.
- More costly products may not be superior with respect to risk of containing contact allergens.​[[19]](#ChouMMikhaylovDLazicStrugarT.Moistu-4C2DBC83)
- Plain petroleum jelly, while greasy, is highly effective, nonirritating and inexpensive.

Evidence has shown that adding emollients (e.g., oils) to bath water does not provide any clinical benefit over standard management,​[[20]](#SanterMRumsbyKRiddMJEtAl.BathAdditi-D8DA9056) but it complicates the bathing routine and poses a possible risk of injury from slipping.​[[21]](#EichenfieldLFTomWLBergerTGEtAl.Guid-9BB1EE3C)

In addition to moisturizers, topical corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy for AD.​[[22]](#BroedersJAAhmedAliUFischerG.Systema-A3673D79) Topical corticosteroids affect several inflammatory pathways in the skin and work quickly and effectively. The actual clinical potency of topical corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure and vehicle as well as the thickness and integrity of the skin. There is no formula to calculate the precise relationship between these factors. Some principles, however, can guide appropriate treatment selection (see [Table 1](#n00313) and [Table 2](#n00314)). A systematic review of once-daily versus more frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids in AD found little difference between regimens with respect to clinical outcomes and adverse events.​[[23]](#c0069n00025) When milder potency corticosteroids are used, application 2–3 times daily may be more effective or lead to more rapid clearance. While inadequate improvement with corticosteroids is often attributed to tachyphylaxis, under- or incorrect use is often the real cause of suboptimal response.​[[24]](#OkwunduNCardwellLAClineAEtAl.Topica-656CE110)

When prescribed and used properly, topical corticosteroids are generally safe medications. Clinically significant adverse effects are rare and generally due to misuse.​[[25]](#NakamuraMAbroukMZhuHEtAl.UpdateOnTh-D8E07F8F)​[[26]](#c0069n00288)​[[27]](#MooneyERademakerMDaileyREtAl.Advers-9BB700FD) Laboratory detection of adverse effects such as cutaneous atrophy and HPA axis suppression due to systemic absorption may not translate to clinical effects in the patient.​[[28]](#c0069n00289)​[[29]](#c0069n00290)​[[30]](#c0069n00291)​[[31]](#c0069n00292)​[[32]](#c0069n00293)​[[33]](#c0069n00294) Regardless, in the setting of AD, “steroid-phobia” is widespread​[[34]](#c0069n00295)​[[35]](#HonKLTsangYCPongNH.CorrelationsAmon-6D519818) and many patients, particularly children, suffer with undertreated AD due to exaggerated fears about corticosteroid side effects. It has been shown that patients who are fearful of corticosteroid use have significantly higher rates of nonadherence with therapy.​[[36]](#LiAWYinESAntayaRJ.TopicalCorticoste-D8E144BB) Many health-care providers automatically warn that these products should be used sparingly, reinforcing this fear.​[[37]](#RaffinDGiraudeauBSamimiMEtAl.Cortic-57AEFA9F)​[[38]](#FarrugiaLLLeeAFischerGEtAl.Evaluati-57AEF255) This can lead to suboptimal therapy and result in the AD being maintained in a chronic, active state. Inadequately treated AD can lead to secondary infection and substantial sleep loss, and can significantly decrease quality of life.​[[39]](#c0069n00305) The negative effects of undertreatment usually outweigh the risk of adverse effects of corticosteroids. Ensure effective use of corticosteroids by choosing the correct potency and vehicle (see [Table 1](#n00313) and [Table 2](#n00314)) and using adequate quantities (see [Table 3](#c0069n00298)) for appropriate periods of time. Treatment should continue until rash and itch are resolved. This may be a few days or up to several weeks for each flare, depending on the patient (see [Figure 1](#c0069n00004)). However, any eruption that does not improve significantly within 2 weeks should be reassessed.

The concept of Fingertip Units (FTUs) was developed to help patients apply appropriate amounts of topical corticosteroids. One FTU is approximately 0.5 g, estimated to be the amount squeezed from a tube (with a standard 5 mm nozzle) from the fingertip to the first crease of an adult finger. Each 1 FTU should cover approximately 250 cm​2 of area (equal to approximately 2 adult handprints with fingers together).​[[40]](#c0069n00300) See [Table 3](#c0069n00298) for guidance on number of FTUs required based on age and affected body site.

**Table 1:** Selection of Topical Corticosteroid by Body Area

| Body Area | Skin Properties | Corticosteroid Potency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Face, intertriginous folds | Thin, more absorption | Low |
| Body, scalp | Medium thickness | Medium |
| Palms, soles | Thick | High |

**Table 2:** Selection of Topical Therapy by Vehicle

| Vehicle | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cream | Cosmetically elegant | Less absorption; additives can irritate |
| Gel | Good for hairy areas, oily skin | Alcohol base will sting/irritate open areas of AD |
| Lotion | Evaporates well; good for large areas, hairy areas | If lotion contains alcohol, will sting/irritate open areas of AD |
| Ointment | Excellent penetration, offers emollient effect, little or no irritation | Cosmetically less acceptable, thick, greasy |

**Table 3:** Estimating Amount of Topical Therapy for 1 Application Using Fingertip Units

| Body Area to Be Treated | Fingertip Units (FTUs) Required for 1 Application (by age group)​[a] | 3–6 Months | 1–2 Years | 3–5 Years | 6–10 Years | Adults |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Face and neck | 1 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 |
| 1 arm and hand | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 4 |
| 1 leg and foot | 1.5 | 2 | 3 | 4.5 | 8 |
| Trunk (front) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3.5 | 7 |
| Trunk (back, including buttocks) | 1.5 | 3 | 3.5 | 5 | 7 |

[a] To calculate quantity to prescribe: (FTU for body area[s] involved × 0.5 g/FTU) × (# applications/day) × (# days of treatment), e.g., to treat a 10-year-old's trunk (front) once daily for 2 weeks: 3.5 FTU × 0.5 g/FTU × 1 application/day × 14 days = 24.5 g.

Calcineurin inhibitors, also referred to as topical immune modulators, are a class of medications designed to specifically block calcineurin. They provide a targeted, specific anti-inflammatory mechanism in contrast to the wide-ranging effects of corticosteroids. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are available in Canada. Considerable evidence supports the safety of these products despite some early concerns.​[[41]](#c0069n00014)​[[42]](#c0069n00279)​[[43]](#SigurgeirssonBBaznanskiAToddG.EtAl.-6D4C5A33)​[[44]](#MargolisDJAbuabaraKHoffstadOJ.EtAl.-6D4CE90A)

Calcineurin inhibitors are an effective class of drugs for the treatment of AD.​[[22]](#BroedersJAAhmedAliUFischerG.Systema-A3673D79) They are approved in Canada as second-line therapy for short- and long-term intermittent treatment. They are sometimes used off-label as first-line therapy, particularly for AD of the face or folds if there is a concern about the amount or frequency of use of low-potency corticosteroids. These products work more slowly than corticosteroids​[[45]](#c0069n00193) and generally require twice-daily dosing. Patients may continue to use corticosteroids elsewhere on the body while using calcineurin inhibitors on face or folds. There is some evidence that tacrolimus ointment is more effective than pimecrolimus cream;​[[46]](#ChenSLYanJWangFS.TwoTopicalCalcineu-6D4FBFFE)​[[47]](#YinZQZhangWMSongGX.EtAl.Meta-analys-6D4FC271) however, practical issues such as type of vehicle (pimecrolimus is a cream, tacrolimus is an ointment) may have a larger influence on treatment decisions than minor differences in effectiveness (see [Table 2](#n00314)). Combining calcineurin inhibitors and topical corticosteroids does not appear to confer benefit over topical corticosteroids alone.​[[48]](#c0069n00166)

Crisaborole (a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor) belongs to a new class of topical anti-inflammatories. It is approved for use on all body areas in mild‑moderate AD. Early studies have shown improvement in AD​[[49]](#YangHWangJZhangXEtaL.ApplicationOfT-4C40484A)​[[50]](#PallerASTomWLLebwohlMGEtAl.Efficacy-EAF45EB0)and associated pruritus​[[51]](#YosipovitchGGoldLFLebwohlMGEtAl.Ear-EAF335A2) but its place in treatment among other therapeutic options remains to be established.

Barrier repair therapies are products developed in response to recognition of the contribution of a defective barrier to the etiology of AD.​[[52]](#c0069n00206) Disrupted ceramide content is one aspect of barrier dysfunction, and restoring the correct balance of ceramides is a strategy employed by newer products. One study found that a ceramide-dominant product was equivalent to a mid-potency corticosteroid after 28 days;​[[53]](#c0069n00207) however, another study found no difference in the management of mild-to-moderate AD when comparing ceramide-dominant barrier repair therapy with another barrier repair therapy or a petrolatum-based moisturizer.​[[54]](#c0069n00266)

Topical treatments for AD are addressed in [Table 4](#c0069n00020).

Evidence for the effectiveness of **probiotics** in the treatment of established atopic dermatitis in children or adults is conflicting, but studies have reported no increased risk of adverse events in those taking probiotics.​[[56]](#c0069n00265)​[[57]](#ZhaoMShenCMaL.TreatmentEfficacyOfPr-D8D3251A)​[[58]](#WuYJWuWFHungCWEtAl.EvaluationOfEffi-D8D3CD4F) Further studies are needed to establish efficacy and confirm safety.

There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of **dietary supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, selenium, fish oil, zinc).​[[59]](#c0069n00252) Herbal products such as **borage oil** or **evening primrose oil** do not seem to be effective in the treatment of AD.​[[60]](#BamfordJTRaySMusekiwaAEtAl.OralEven-A3674941)

Consider referral to a dermatologist for patients who fail to achieve good control of their AD despite nonpharmacologic management (trigger avoidance, generous use of moisturizers) in combination with first- and second-line therapies such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

Other therapies such as systemic agents (e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporine, dupilumab, methotrexate, upadacitinib) or ultraviolet (UV) light have been used in patients with extensive dermatitis, patients who have not responded to topical treatment and those who are unable to tolerate topical therapy. Alitretinoin is approved for severe chronic hand AD in adults; referral to a dermatologist is recommended. *Oral* corticosteroids should not be routinely used in the treatment of AD, given their many side effects and the tendency for the AD to rebound on withdrawal of corticosteroids.​[[61]](#c0069n00208)

### Flare Prevention

Ongoing routine use of a **moisturizer** at least once daily is the mainstay of therapy for prevention of flares in AD (see [Pharmacologic Choices](#c0069n00023)). Additionally, evidence suggests the use of long-term intermittent topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to previously involved skin may help to keep AD in remission. Different regimens exist and generally involve application 2–3 times weekly. Duration of use has ranged from 16–40 weeks or longer, depending on the specific agent.​[[62]](#c0069n00167)​[[63]](#c0069n00170)​[[64]](#c0069n00171)​[[65]](#c0069n00195)​[[66]](#c0069n00209) Use of tacrolimus twice weekly for flare prevention is an approved indication in Canada, while the other regimens remain off-label. A systematic review of proactive treatment suggests that both tacrolimus and topical corticosteroids (several potencies) aid in flare prevention when used twice weekly, and that a potent topical corticosteroid may be more efficacious in flare prevention than tacrolimus.​[[67]](#c0069n00233) There is also evidence to support early intervention with calcineurin inhibitors at the first signs of a flare to prevent progression to a more serious episode.​[[68]](#c0069n00196)​[[69]](#c0069n00197)

### Secondary Infection

Secondary infection is common with AD. Bacterially infected AD may have oozing, honey crusting or significant hemorrhagic crusting as well as bright red, friable tissue. Presence of fever or chills is rare. Sometimes signs of infection are more subtle and present as AD that is worsening or failing to respond to appropriate treatment. Localized areas of infection in an otherwise healthy patient can typically be treated with topical therapy. Oral antibiotics may be more appropriate when infection is widespread, the patient is systemically ill or topical antibiotics have failed to clear the infection.

Questions have arisen about the role of preventive strategies with topical antiseptics or prophylactic antibiotics. Bleach baths are a technique sometimes employed for patients with frequent infections. They are thought to work by lowering bacterial counts on the skin or through other, perhaps anti-inflammatory, pathways. Published studies have reported various methods, concentrations and results. Some studies have found bleach baths to be helpful​[[70]](#HuangJTAbramsMTlouganBEtAl.Treatmen-583186D6)​[[71]](#WongSMNgTGBabaR.EfficacyAndSafetyOf-58320CE7) while others, including a systematic review, have not found any benefit over plain water baths.​[[72]](#ChopraRVakhariaPPSacotteREtAl.Effic-D8E31BBA)​[[73]](#HonKLTsangYCLeeVWEtAl.EfficacyOfSod-5831CBB4) Another systematic review examined 41 randomized controlled trials that used a variety of antistaphylococcal treatments in the management of AD, including oral antibiotics, antibacterial soaps, topical antibiotics or antiseptics, special textiles, and combinations of topical corticosteroids with antibacterials. While reduction of S. aureus counts on the skin was reported with some interventions, few trials showed improvement in AD control. The poor quality of many of the studies and low patient numbers make this evidence difficult to interpret.​[[74]](#c0069n00286)

### Sleep Disturbance

Patients with poorly controlled AD often report poor or disturbed sleep due to itch and irritation. Disease severity correlates with sleep disturbance,​[[75]](#KongTSHanTYLeeJHEtAl.CorrelationBet-583615B8) making improved treatment of underlying AD the most important intervention to improve sleep. Although there is no evidence for their effectiveness in the treatment of AD,​[[76]](#MatterneUBxf6hmerMMWeisshaarEEtAl.C-4C442EDE) some sources recommend short-term intermittent use of first-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) for sleep disturbance in AD due to their sedating properties,​[[77]](#SidburyRDavisDMCohenDEEtAl.Guidelin-583789C0) but not as a substitute for better disease control.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Atopic Dermatitis and Pregnancy

Atopic dermatitis is the most common skin condition in pregnancy, although overall prevalence during pregnancy is unknown.​[[78]](#c0069n00182) Sixty to 80% of affected pregnant patients develop symptoms for the first time during pregnancy, usually within the first 2 trimesters. One-quarter of women with pre-existing AD will improve during pregnancy, but over half will experience worsening of the condition. Untreated AD can be extremely uncomfortable and carries the considerable risk of secondary infection. There is some evidence that maternal use of probiotics during pregnancy or maternal and/or infant use during breastfeeding may be helpful in reducing the development of AD in the child.​[[6]](#Cuello-GarciaCABrozekJLFiocchiAEtAl-550F9127)

### Pre-pregnancy Management

Ideally, disease activity should be minimized prior to conception. Patients receiving systemic treatment may need to discontinue their medication well before conception; timing depends on the drugs involved. Methotrexate must be stopped at least 3 months prior to conception in women.​[[78]](#c0069n00182)​[[80]](#c0069n00183) It is also recommended that men stop methotrexate 3 months prior to conception;​[[78]](#c0069n00182)​[[80]](#c0069n00183) however, limited evidence does not show any adverse pregnancy or fetal outcomes after paternal low-dose methotrexate exposure near or during time of conception.​[[81]](#c0069n00302)​[[82]](#GutierrezJCHwangK.TheToxicityOfMeth-D8E4AB9B)​[[83]](#GarritsenFMVanDenBroekMPHVanZuilenA-D8E4DAF1) Although no specific time period is recommended, psoralens with UVA should be stopped before attempting to conceive.

### Management of Atopic Dermatitis during Pregnancy

Maximize nonpharmacologic approaches, such as the use of moisturizers and the avoidance of environmental irritants. There is no information available on the safety of barrier repair therapies in pregnancy but the ingredients (skin lipids) are not expected to pose a significant risk. Topical corticosteroids remain the main treatment option throughout pregnancy. Low- and mid-potency corticosteroids are preferred over potent or very potent agents.​[[78]](#c0069n00182)​[[84]](#c0069n00175)​[[85]](#c0069n00243)​[[86]](#VaughanJonesSAmbros-RudolphCNelson--6D4DC897) If further treatment is needed, second-line choices include UVB therapy and calcineurin inhibitors (very low bioavailability when applied topically).​[[78]](#c0069n00182) There is no information available on the safety of crisaborole during human pregnancy; animal studies have not shown adverse effects.​[[79]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabase.Eu-7FA3E8BB) Systemic therapy with cyclosporine or azathioprine is considered only in the most severe cases after careful discussion, and requires close monitoring for both mother and baby in a hospital setting. Methotrexate and upadacitinib are contraindicated during pregnancy. In animal studies, and small numbers of human case reports, pregnancies exposed to dupilumab have not shown an increased risk of birth defects, but data are limited.​[[87]](#MotherToBaby.FactSheetsDupilumabDup-491456C6)

### Management of Atopic Dermatitis during Breastfeeding

Moisturizers and topical corticosteroids remain the main treatment options throughout breastfeeding. Though safety data are lacking for **ceramide**-based barrier repair therapies, there is no theoretical reason for concern. Risk to the baby via passage of topical corticosteroids into breast milk is unlikely, since only extensive use of the most potent corticosteroids causes systemic effects in the mother. The topical corticosteroid with the lowest effective potency should be applied to the smallest area possible for the shortest possible time.​[[78]](#c0069n00182)​[[88]](#c0069n00185)​[[89]](#c0069n00186) **Topical** calcineurin inhibitors appear to be poorly absorbed after topical administration and are second-line therapy.​[[78]](#c0069n00182)​[[88]](#c0069n00185)​[[89]](#c0069n00186) There is no information available about transfer of topical crisaborole into breast milk.​[[79]](#HealthCanada.DrugProductDatabase.Eu-7FA3E8BB) For all topical medications, avoid direct contact of the infant with the mother's treated skin. UVB therapy is considered safe during breastfeeding.​[[78]](#c0069n00182) Dupilumab is unlikely to be transferred to breast milk in significant amounts due to its large molecular weight but caution is advised for nursing newborn or premature infants.​[[88]](#c0069n00185) Avoid methotrexate, upadacitinib, cyclosporine during breastfeeding. Studies on azathioprine have found low or unmeasureable amounts of active metabolites in breast milk and no adverse effects have been found in infants exposed through breastfeeding.​[[90]](#AngelbergerSReinischWMesserschmidtA-49192F00)

Up to 2% of mothers develop AD of the nipple or areola during breastfeeding.​[[78]](#c0069n00182) Moisturizers and low-potency corticosteroids can be applied to the areola or nipple and wiped off gently but thoroughly before nursing. To prevent ingestion by the infant, topical calcineurin inhibitors should not be applied to the nipple/areola.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Ointments are less irritating and penetrate better than creams or lotions. They are an excellent choice for AD but cosmetic acceptability and patient adherence are lower. Generally, the same corticosteroid molecule will be more potent in an ointment base than in a cream or lotion.
- Education is a key part of therapy. Patients have to understand they have a chronic, recurring condition that can be controlled, not cured.
- Sweat, stress and overheating can all increase itching.
- Patches of dermatitis that are resistant to treatment despite good adherence to therapy may require a short course of a more potent corticosteroid.
- Pruritus in AD is not histamine-mediated and therefore does not respond well to histamine blockade. Nonsedating antihistamines are of little use in the pruritus of AD but may help associated allergic symptoms, e.g., allergic conjunctivitis. Sedating antihistamines prior to bedtime may provide some relief, possibly through central sedation (see [Sleep Disturbance](#topic-1765-58349263)).

### Algorithms

![](images/atopicdermatitis_manatoder.gif)

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad281779e1352) Crisaborole is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in adults and children >2 y of age. Its place in therapy is not clear due to lack of evidence of comparative efficacy versus moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, barrier repair therapy or topical calcineurin inhibitors.
