### Pathophysiology

Cold temperature–induced skin injury is categorized as freezing (frostbite) or nonfreezing (frostnip, chilblains/perniosis and trench foot). This chapter focuses on frostbite (see [Table 2](#NonfreezingCold-inducedSkinInjuries-5C0E9453) for information on the characteristics and management of nonfreezing skin injuries).

Frostbite refers to freezing of tissue caused by temperatures below the freezing point of intact skin. Pathologic effects of frostbite involve direct and indirect cellular injury. Direct cellular injury occurs due to the formation of extracellular and intracellular ice crystals, cellular dehydration and shrinkage, electrolyte changes, and thermal shock. Indirect cellular injury occurs when rewarming of the tissue results in reperfusion damage (intracellular swelling, tissue edema, platelet aggregation, infiltration of inflammatory mediators) leading to progressive ischemia, microvascular thrombosis and tissue necrosis.​[[1]](#KnapikJJReynoldsKLCastellaniJW.Fros-54DDEC8E)​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)​[[3]](#JoshiKGoyaryDMazumderBEtAl.Frostbit-54DE9061) The severity of injury and degree of irreversible damage is related to the duration of exposure, depth of frozen tissue and length of time it remains frozen, rather than solely to air temperature.​[[4]](#FudgeJ.PreventingAndManagingHypothe-54DFD5E9)

Factors that may increase the risk of frostbite include:​[[1]](#KnapikJJReynoldsKLCastellaniJW.Fros-54DDEC8E)​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)​[[3]](#JoshiKGoyaryDMazumderBEtAl.Frostbit-54DE9061)​[[5]](#Laskowski-JonesLJonesLJ.FrostbiteDo-54E925C9)​[[6]](#HallamMJCubisonTDheansaBEtAl.Managi-54E95448)​[[7]](#IngramBJRaymondTJ.RecognitionAndTre-54E98B94)​[[8]](#RathjenNAShahbodaghiSDBrownJA.Hypot-54E9D392)

- High wind speeds, high humidity, increased altitude, lower temperatures, longer length of exposure, inadequate or restrictive clothing, immobilization
- Extended exposure to the elements such as through winter sports, homelessness, military activities, vehicular trauma
- Sweating and exhaustion during heavy, physical outdoor work
- Malfunction or improper use of refrigerants, liquid nitrogen, fluorinated hydrocarbons, dry ice
- Improper use of ice packs (direct contact with the skin for >20 min)
- Cigarette smoking or use of any nicotine products (causes acute vasoconstriction)
- Impaired judgment/altered mental status e.g., dementia, psychiatric illness, alcohol, recreational or illicit drug use
- Medical conditions that reduce circulation (e.g., dehydration, diabetes, Raynaud disease, peripheral vascular disease) or lead to decreased perception of cold (e.g., peripheral neuropathy)
- Medications: beta-blockers (via peripheral vasoconstriction), CNS depressants (impaired awareness and judgment)
- Extremes of age: infants have a higher ratio of body surface area to mass and the elderly have a decreased capacity for metabolic heat production and vasoconstriction
- Prior cold injuries: previously cold-damaged skin is more susceptible

Frostbite most often affects the hands, fingers, feet, toes, nose, cheeks and ears.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

Frostbite is traditionally classified as first, second, third or fourth degree based on both acute physical findings and imaging after rewarming (see [Table 1](#CategorizationOfFrostbite-5C07E6ED)). Initial assessment of severity is difficult as still-frozen tissue is hard, numb and pale (more evident in lightly pigmented skin and may not show in darkly pigmented skin). A simplified classification of either superficial (first and second degree with no or minimal anticipated loss of tissue) or deep (third and fourth degree with tissue loss anticipated) is recommended by some organizations. Severity of frostbite may vary within a single extremity.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

**Table 1:** Categorization of Frostbite​[[1]](#KnapikJJReynoldsKLCastellaniJW.Fros-54DDEC8E)[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)[[4]](#FudgeJ.PreventingAndManagingHypothe-54DFD5E9)[[5]](#Laskowski-JonesLJonesLJ.FrostbiteDo-54E925C9)[[7]](#IngramBJRaymondTJ.RecognitionAndTre-54E98B94)[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)[[10]](#NguyenCMChandlerRRatanshiIEtAl.Fros-6DA08F04)

| Category | Description | Signs and Symptoms​[a]​[b] | Tissue Loss |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First degree | Freezing of: partial thickness skin; involvement of epidermis only | White or yellow raised area, which may be visible in lightly pigmented skin but less visible in darkly pigmented skin; may feel firm No blistering Possibly mild edema (2–3 h after rewarming) with redness (in lightly pigmented skin) or purple-grey colour (in darkly pigmented skin) Numbness, tingling or burning (usually lasting 24–48 h ) Severe pain and throbbing within a few hours of thawing | No tissue loss |
| Second degree | Freezing of: full thickness skin; involvement of epidermis and dermis | Significant swelling with redness (in lightly pigmented skin) or purple-grey colour (in darkly pigmented skin) Large blisters filled with a clear or milky fluid form 12–24 h after thawing Throbbing, aching pain for 3–10 days after injury | Minimal or no tissue loss |
| Third degree | Freezing of: full thickness skin; involvement of epidermis and dermis subcutaneous tissue | Hemorrhagic blisters appear within 24 h Throbbing, shooting, burning pain | Tissue loss probable |
| Fourth degree | Freezing of: full thickness skin; involvement of epidermis and dermis subcutaneous tissue muscle, tendons, bone | Areas remain cold, waxy, firm and numb after rewarming May have areas of deep red (in lightly pigmented skin) or black, brown, purple or grey (in darkly pigmented skin) mottled skin Areas with deep colour changes or mottled appearance initially become dry and black Possible hemorrhagic blisters (do not always appear) Possible joint pain May become gangrenous | Possible mummification and autoamputation |

**Table 2:** Nonfreezing Cold-Induced Skin Injuries

| Condition | Description | Characteristics | Management |
| Frostnip​ [1] ​ [9] | Superficial nonfreezing injury in which cooling of the tissues results in ice crystal formation on the skin surface | Signs/symptoms: numbness, mild local pain in the exposed area (usually cheeks, ears, nose), possibly skin colour change (redness in lightly pigmented skin; purple to grey in darkly pigmented skin), mild edema No long-term tissue damage | Prevention: dress appropriately for the weather, including covering susceptible areas Treatment: rewarming, including covering with clothing, breathing on the affected area, moving to a warmer location |
| Chilblains (pernio/perniosis)​ [1] ​ [11] ​ [12] | An abnormal inflammatory response to cold, damp, nonfreezing conditions Proposed etiology: prolonged vasoconstriction/spasm of small vessels | Signs/symptoms: persistent (lasting >24 h) single or multiple symmetrically distributed lesions with blanchable colour changes, ranging from red to blue in lightly pigmented skin and purple to grey to black in darkly pigmented skin; burning, itching, swelling. Severe cases may include blisters and ulceration Most commonly affects toes and fingers; less commonly ears and face Seasonal in nature: onset in winter, resolution of episodes in spring Risk factors: exposure to cold, nonfreezing wet weather, homes lacking central heating, low body mass index, smoking, possibly genetic predisposition | Prevention: avoidance of exposure to cold is key: ensure appropriate clothing and prophylactic warming of susceptible areas Treatment: most cases resolve in 2–3 wk without treatment; nifedipine and pentoxifylline may be effective for treatment, but evidence is limited and conflicting​ [11] ​ [13] |
| Trench foot (cold water immersion foot)​ [3] ​ [8] | Prolonged (>10–14 h) exposure of the feet to wet, cold conditions resulting in tissue ischemia and nerve and vascular damage, which may be permanent | Signs/symptoms: tingling, itching, feeling heavy/stiff, progressing to numbness then blotchiness, swelling, blisters, sores, eventual necrosis and possibly death due to sepsis or other complications in the absence of treatment Risk factors: military personnel, homeless people, multiday outdoor event attendees | Prevention: keep feet warm, dry and clean Treatment: slow, passive rewarming with neuropathic pain control (rewarming can cause severe nerve pain); NSAIDs for pain and swelling; treatment for infection, if present ​ [14] |

### Long-term effects

Long-term effects of cold injuries are common and may affect an individual’s life for years.​[[6]](#HallamMJCubisonTDheansaBEtAl.Managi-54E95448)​[[15]](#RegliIBStrapazzonGFallaMEtAl.Long-t-5EB38869)​[[16]](#HandfordCBuxtonPRussellKEtAl.Frostb-72003161)

- Previously frostbitten tissue is more susceptible to future cold injury, possibly due to vasomotor disturbances sustained during the initial frostbite episode
- Chronic regional pain, possibly extreme: pain in the frostbitten area is a common complaint and may continue even in tissues that have been successfully treated
- Cold hypersensitivity: frostbitten tissues may remain hypersensitive to cold
- Numbness and decreased sensitivity to touch in areas that were frostbitten, particularly in fingers
- Frostbite arthritis, resembling osteoarthritis, can occur in joints in the area of the frostbite injury
- Localized osteoporosis and bone loss, occurring within a month of frostbite and continuing to progress
- Children can experience premature fusion and abnormal growth in the affected epiphyseal cartilage
- Ulceration: skin areas that have been frostbitten may be prone to the development of chronic ulcers due to poor quality of tissue after healing and there have been reports of skin malignancy at sites of previous frostbite
- Other effects: hyperhydrosis, nail deformities

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent further heat loss
- Rewarm the area once removed from the environment
- Control pain appropriately
- Prevent infection in damaged tissues

### Patient Assessment

Assess all patients with suspected frostbite for trauma, unstable underlying comorbidities and symptoms of hypothermia:​[[8]](#RathjenNAShahbodaghiSDBrownJA.Hypot-54E9D392)​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

- **Early hypothermia**: the body generates heat via shivering; circulation is reduced
- **Moderate hypothermia**: shivering, pupil dilatation, slowed breathing, slow or uncoordinated movement, confusion, sleepiness, increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias
- **Severe hypothermia**: likely unconscious, weak respiration and pulse, much higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia

Treatment for hypothermia includes passive rewarming, if possible, and transportation to emergency care as soon as possible.

Except in the case of mild (first-degree) frostbite (after thawing, the affected area is its normal colour, warm, has no blisters and pain is controlled with nonprescription analgesics), emergency hospital care for all patients is recommended for the following reasons:​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)​[[7]](#IngramBJRaymondTJ.RecognitionAndTre-54E98B94)​[[17]](#HutchsionRL.FrostbiteOfTheHand.JHan-71FEA917)

- Severity of the injury is difficult to assess while tissue is still frozen; proper rewarming and post-warming assessment is required
- Full extent of the injury may not become apparent for several days and may be more severe than the original appearance suggested; close observation is recommended during this time
- Some treatment options for severe frostbite (e.g., thrombolytics, vasodilators) are recommended to be instituted within 24 hours of injury

See [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1175n01009) for information on first aid measures to be instituted until emergency hospital care is available. Assessment of patients with frostbite is presented in [Figure 1](#psc1175n01007).

### Prevention

Frostbite and related cold injuries can generally be prevented with planning prior to exposure to the cold. Ensuring adequate tissue perfusion and minimizing heat loss are the main components of frostbite prevention.

Measures to reduce the risk of frostbite include:​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)​[[4]](#FudgeJ.PreventingAndManagingHypothe-54DFD5E9)​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

- Maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition
- Avoiding constrictive clothing that may reduce blood flow
- Avoiding environmental conditions below −15°C, even with low wind speeds
- Dressing appropriately: wear a warm hat and heavy warm mittens (preferred over gloves); increase insulation by layering clothes appropriately; choose synthetic fabrics, fleece, silk or wool blends; avoid cotton, as it retains moisture
- Avoiding wet extremities (keep hands and feet dry by regularly replacing wet mittens and socks)
- Avoiding drugs or alcohol as they may impair awareness of changing physical and environmental conditions
- Using chemical hand and foot warmers (these must not be placed directly against the skin or constrict blood flow in any way)
- Recognizing frostnip or superficial frostbite before it progresses; an extremity at risk of frostbite (e.g., numb, poor dexterity) should be warmed in the axilla or on the abdomen
- Minimizing duration of exposure to cold
- Using caution while exercising; it can increase core and peripheral temperatures and perfusion, but can also lead to exhaustion and collapse
- Using caution when applying ice packs to injuries: limit application to 20-minute intervals and ensure a cloth is placed between the ice pack and the skin
- Note: applying emollients on the skin is *not* preventive and may even increase risk of frostbite

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Until emergency medical care is available, the following first aid measures can be undertaken:​[[1]](#KnapikJJReynoldsKLCastellaniJW.Fros-54DDEC8E)​[[4]](#FudgeJ.PreventingAndManagingHypothe-54DFD5E9)​[[7]](#IngramBJRaymondTJ.RecognitionAndTre-54E98B94)​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)​[[10]](#NguyenCMChandlerRRatanshiIEtAl.Fros-6DA08F04)

- Move the patient to a warm location as soon as possible; unless absolutely necessary, the person should not walk on frostbitten toes or feet
- Replace wet clothing with dry clothing before moving to a warm environment, if possible
- Do not thaw the area if there is any risk of refreezing, as this can worsen tissue damage
- Remove jewellery or constrictive clothing from the affected area (swelling may occur while thawing)
- Do not rub the area (even to dry it), as friction can increase tissue damage
- Do not use heat from fires or stoves to warm the area: burn injuries may occur
- Institute **passive rewarming** (warmer location, body heat from another person, blankets, tucking affected area into the axilla, groin or against the abdomen) until active rewarming can be started; if active rewarming cannot be undertaken, allow passive rewarming to occur provided there will be no further exposure to the cold environment
- Institute rapid **active rewarming** as soon as possible by immersing in circulating warm water (recommendations range from 37–42°C; comfortably warm bath) for 15–30 minutes until the skin feels soft and pliable and appears red or purple (in lightly pigmented skin; may be hard to see colour changes in darkly pigmented skin)
- Rewarming may cause severe pain: provide adequate analgesia (see [Pharmacologic Therapy](#psc1175n01010))
- After rewarming, elevate the affected area above the level of the heart to minimize edema
- Fingers and toes may be carefully separated by dry, sterile dressings/gauze
- Apply bulky, dry gauze dressings loosely to the thawed area to provide protection until the patient is transported to a medical centre. Anticipate significant swelling and apply dressing loosely enough to accommodate it and to avoid putting pressure on the damaged tissue
- Because dehydration may be present, ensure the patient is adequately hydrated (oral fluids if alert or warmed IV fluids if patient is vomiting or has altered level of consciousness)
- If blisters develop, leave them intact to decrease risk of infection, unless they are restricting range of motion
- If blisters rupture, cover with clean, dry gauze until emergency medical care is available
- Discourage smoking or use of nicotine products by the patient, as nicotine may cause vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Products: First Aid.

Due to a lack of randomized, controlled trials, recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of frostbite are based on guidelines created by expert panels using consensus and limited, low-quality evidence.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)​[[18]](#CochraneInjuriesGroupLorentzenAKDab-5E1DAB7C)

### Pain management

The rewarming process, as discussed in [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1175n01009), can be very painful. Ensure provision of adequate analgesia.

NSAIDs, usually ibuprofen, are recommended for pain relief due to their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.

Serious frostbite may require the use of opioid analgesics for pain relief.

### Tissue reperfusion

#### Ibuprofen

Early use of ibuprofen is theorized to help prevent further tissue damage by decreasing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes that can cause vasoconstriction and therefore worsen dermal ischemia. Some guidelines recommend the routine use of ibuprofen at a dose of 12 mg/kg/day divided BID (maximum 2400 mg/24 h) for its prostaglandin inhibitory effects, even in the absence of pain, until the frostbite injury is healed or surgical intervention is undertaken.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A) Others recommend a dose of 400 mg Q12H.​[[18]](#CochraneInjuriesGroupLorentzenAKDab-5E1DAB7C)

#### Aloe vera

Limited observational evidence shows aloe vera may improve frostbite outcomes by reducing prostaglandin and thromboxane formation in more serious frostbite where blisters have formed.​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6)​[[18]](#CochraneInjuriesGroupLorentzenAKDab-5E1DAB7C) Although it does not penetrate far into tissue and may be beneficial only for superficial areas, some guidelines recommend aloe vera gel be applied to thawed tissue at each dressing change or Q6H despite the limited evidence, as the risks associated with its use are low.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

#### Thrombolytics

Despite a lack of robust evidence, thrombolytics, most commonly intra-arterial or intravenous rTPA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) are recommended in an attempt to restore perfusion when tissue viability is threatened by the microvascular thrombosis that occurs with serious frostbite injury.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A) They are recommended to be started within 24 hours of thawing and administered for an average of 48 hours.​[[19]](#DrinaneJKotamartiVOConnorCEtAl.Thro-5E36D75A) One expert group has created guidelines for use of thrombolytics in frostbite.​[[20]](#HickeySWhitsonAJonesLEtAl.Guideline-5E3777F9)

#### Iloprost

A limited number of poor-quality studies have assessed the effectiveness of the synthetic prostacyclin (PGI2) analogue iloprost in reducing amputation rates in severe frostbite due to its vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor effects. Starting iloprost within 48–72 hours of injury has reduced amputation rates in small studies and case series. It has been used in combination with rTPA or as monotherapy.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)​[[21]](#PooleAGauthierJMacLennanM.Managemen-5F2F309E)

#### Heparin

Unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is not recommended as monotherapy, but evidence does support its use as adjunctive therapy in rTPA protocols.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A) Combining iloprost with rTPA and heparin has also been used.​[[21]](#PooleAGauthierJMacLennanM.Managemen-5F2F309E)

### Prevention of infection

Frostbite injuries are not inherently prone to infection; however, antimicrobial medications may play a role in some situations.

#### Antiseptics

Despite a lack of evidence of effectiveness, some sources recommend adding an antiseptic solution such as poviodine–iodine or chlorhexidine to the rewarming water as it could theoretically reduce skin bacterial counts and risk of cellulitis in injuries where severe edema is present (edema is thought to make skin more susceptible to gram-positive infection).​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

#### Topical antibiotics

Although evidence is not available regarding effectiveness, some experts recommend **topical antibiotics** be applied in cases where blisters have been débrided or have ruptured, as the area may be at a higher risk of infection.​[[3]](#JoshiKGoyaryDMazumderBEtAl.Frostbit-54DE9061)

#### Systemic antibiotics

Use of **systemic antibiotics** for infection prophylaxis is controversial as there is no evidence to support the practice; however, they are sometimes used in cases of significant tissue loss seen in severe or extensive frostbite.​[[2]](#HandfordCThomasOImrayCHE.Frostbite.-54DE35B6) Systemic antibiotics are prudent in patients with considerable trauma, other possible infectious sources, or signs and symptoms of cellulitis or sepsis.​[[9]](#McIntoshSEFreerLGrissomCKEtAl.Wilde-5F3D3B8A)

#### Tetanus prophylaxis

Frostbite injuries that include blisters are prone to tetanus and therefore **tetanus prophylaxis** is indicated.​[[10]](#NguyenCMChandlerRRatanshiIEtAl.Fros-6DA08F04)

### Treatment of long–term effects of cold injury

Chronic regional pain related to previous frostbite injury can be difficult to treat. Duloxetine, amitriptyline and gabapentin have been used when the pain is neuropathic in nature.​[[15]](#RegliIBStrapazzonGFallaMEtAl.Long-t-5EB38869)

Preliminary studies of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of neuropathic and vasomotor sequelae of frostbite are promising.​[[15]](#RegliIBStrapazzonGFallaMEtAl.Long-t-5EB38869)

Physiotherapy intervention may relieve some of the pain and discomfort associated with frostbite arthritis.​[[15]](#RegliIBStrapazzonGFallaMEtAl.Long-t-5EB38869)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 3](#psc1175n01013) provides information on monitoring of therapy for frostbite.

**Table 3:** Monitoring of Therapy for Frostbite​[[8]](#RathjenNAShahbodaghiSDBrownJA.Hypot-54E9D392)

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tissue appearance (Hard, frozen-looking tissue; appears whitish on lightly pigment skin, though colour change may not be apparent on darkly pigmented skin) | Monitor continuously until area has rewarmed (30–60 min in warm water). Monitor over the next 24-48 h for blistering or signs of infection. Monitor for 4–7 days for wound healing and signs of infection if blisters are present. | Rewarmed tissue will be warm and pliable and will appear red on lightly pigment skin, though colour change may not be apparent on darkly pigmented skin. It may be swollen. Areas of superficial frostbite will develop normal colour and warmth with no blisters within 24 h . | Patients require further assessment and treatment if there are signs of infection (pus, increased colour change, fever, increased pain). If blisters rupture, cover with nonadherent gauze and consider need for topical antibiotics.​ [a] |
| Numbness and tingling | Monitor for symptoms of numbness and tingling during rewarming. Monitor for 24–48 h for increase in numbness or tingling with superficial frostbite. Monitor for 2–4 wk for signs of improvement or worsening of numbness or tingling to the area frozen. | Symptoms of tingling and pain are tolerable by patient during rewarming. In superficial frostbite, tingling and numbness subside without treatment within 24–48 h . In deep frostbite, tingling and numbness may persist for weeks after freezing. | Patients with superficial frostbite with continued numbness and tingling for 24–48 h need further assessment and/or treatment, as the frostbite may be worse than initially thought. Patients with tingling and numbness longer than 2 wk should have already been assessed, as the frostbite is likely deep frostbite. |
| Pain | Monitor pain every 4–6 h for 24 h. If pain increases or is not resolved with nonprescription treatment within 24 h , further pain assessment is required. | Pain relief during and after the rewarming process. Pain relief within 24 h for superficial frostbite. | Treat with pain relievers according to type of frostbite. Superficial frostbite: NSAIDs (ibuprofen). Deep frostbite: if pain relief has not improved with nonprescription pain relievers, further assessment for possible treatment with opioids is necessary. |

[a] Evidence to support use of topical antibiotics in this scenario is lacking; however, they are often used in practice.
