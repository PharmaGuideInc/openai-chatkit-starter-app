CPhA acknowledges the contribution of Dr. Farid Esfahani as a previous author of this chapter.  
CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women,” “female” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

### Pathophysiology

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by targeted destruction of CNS myelin, as well as axonal degeneration and loss. The precise pathogenic mechanisms are not clearly understood, but in the early stages, neural damage is thought to result from immune-mediated destruction of myelin.​[[1]](#c0127n1003) The most widely accepted theory of what triggers MS involves an autoimmune response to a foreign molecule with a structure similar to a component of CNS myelin.​[[2]](#c0127n1001) MS is now proposed to be a biphasic disease consisting of an initial focal inflammatory phase, followed later by a primarily degenerative phase, with inflammation that is more diffuse.​[[3]](#c0127n1002)

As a result of demyelination, the propagation of electrical nerve signals is interrupted, leading to a vast array of clinical symptoms including numbness, weakness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, ataxia, optic neuritis, bowel/bladder abnormalities and neuropathic pain.​[[4]](#c0127n1004) The areas of eroded myelin along CNS axonal tracts are referred to as lesions or plaques. Though early acute lesions often have the ability to remyelinate, repeated insult or severe initial insult leads to chronic lesions.​[[5]](#c0127n1005)​[[6]](#c0127n1006)​[[7]](#c0127n1007) The ultimate failure to repair demyelinated lesions and the axonal loss result in the neurologic deficits characteristic of MS.

### Prevalence

Canada has one of the highest prevalence rates of MS in the world, with 250 cases per 100 000 in 2020.​[[8]](#c0127n05011) Women are more than twice as likely to develop MS, though men generally have a worse prognosis, owing to their greater tendency to develop the primary progressive form of MS.​[[9]](#c0127n1008)

### Etiology

No specific gene has been directly linked to MS; however, first-degree relatives of people with MS are at an approximately 5% increased risk of developing the disease.​[[10]](#c0127n1010) Some research scientists postulate that MS develops because of a genetic predisposition to mount an immune response to an environmental stimulus. The environmental factor most likely to be associated with MS susceptibility is low sunlight exposure/vitamin D synthesis.​[[11]](#c0127n1011) Low vitamin D levels in pregnant patients and in neonates are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop MS in mothersand neonates.​[[12]](#c0127n9875)​[[13]](#c0127n9876) Environmental exposure to smoking, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus may increase the risk of developing MS later in life.​[[14]](#c0127n1009) Other factors such as childhood obesity, dietary fat, nutrition, antioxidants and hormones have also been associated.​[[15]](#c0127n1014)​[[16]](#PetrinJFianderMDossPMIAEtAl.AScopi)

### Disease Course

Three basic types of MS have been identified: *relapsing-remitting* (RRMS), *secondary progressive* (SPMS) and *primary progressive* (PPMS) (see [Table 1](#n99545)).​[[17]](#c0127n23456) Most patients (80%) present with an initial acute episode known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Various sets of criteria have been proposed for making an accurate diagnosis of MS; however, the only internationally agreed upon criteria are the McDonald criteria, most recently revised in 2017.​[[18]](#c0127n01169) In general, the McDonald criteria indicate that patients can be diagnosed with MS provided they have at least 1 clinical MS attack and at least 1 lesion found on imaging, provided that they have occurred at different times and in different areas of the central nervous system.​[[18]](#c0127n01169)

**Table 1:** Types of Multiple Sclerosis​[[17]](#c0127n23456)[[18]](#c0127n01169)

| Type of MS​[a] | Incidence | Characteristics | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) | N/A | Patient-reported symptoms suggestive of MS without a confirmed diagnosis. Typically presents as unilateral optic neuritis, partial myelopathy or focal syndromes. | DMT may be initiated if there are 2 or more brain lesions consistent with MS.​ [19] ​ [b] Alternately, DMT may be withheld and the patient monitored closely. |
| Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) | 85–90% of cases at onset | Relapses with stable neurological disability between episodes. | DMT should be initiated upon diagnosis.​ [b] |
| Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) | 65% of patients with RRMS after 15–20 y​ [20] | Progressive course following an initial relapsing-remitting course. | DMT is effective for active SPMS only. Siponimod is the only DMT indicated for active SPMS. |
| Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) | 10–15% of cases at onset | Steadily increasing objectively documented neurologic disability independent of relapses from disease onset. | Ocrelizumab is the only DMT conditionally approved for PPMS. |

[a] Any type of MS can be in an active or inactive state, relating to clinical relapses or MRI imaging lesions over a determined period of time.

[b] Not always possible, as many provincial drug coverage criteria require patient has 2 relapses in a 2-year period to be eligible for DMT; depending on when second relapse occurs and/or diagnosis is made, patient may not be eligible for drug coverage. Also, not all DMT are approved for treatment of CIS.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce the number, severity and duration of MS relapses with demonstrated improvements on MRI and in brain atrophy measures
- Slow relapse-related disease progression and delay time to permanent disability
- Improve quality of life

### Investigations

Investigations are guided by clinical presentation and may be more extensive or limited depending on how clearly the history, physical examination and MRI suggest MS.

- CBC with differential
- ALT and AST
- Antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and CRP
- TSH
- Vitamin D levels (see [Etiology](#c0127n00003))
- Vitamin B12 (deficiency can mimic MS symptoms)
- EBV antibodies (negative serology may support diagnosis other than MS)​[[21]](#AbrahamyanSEberspacherBHoshiMMEtAl.-57F32252)
- MRI ± gadolinium to identify and quantify lesions in brain and/or spinal cord
- Cerebrospinal fluid exam for oligoclonal banding and visual evoked potential to support the diagnosis
- Complete neurologic exam
- Presence of common comorbid conditions, including depression and anxiety​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Some MS symptoms may be improved through the use of nonpharmacologic measures.​[[22]](#c0127n1018)​[[23]](#HaselkornJKHughesCRae-GrantAEtAl.Su-C80E6EB8) For example, physiotherapy and stretching are used to help manage spasticity and gait disturbances, fluid intake restriction and pelvic floor exercises can be helpful for bladder symptoms, surgical interventions such as stereotactic thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation may benefit patients with localized tremor, and respiratory training may improve inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in patients with mild to moderate dysfunction.

There is some evidence that smoking may cause earlier conversion from RRMS to SPMS​[[24]](#RamanujamRHedstromAKManouchehriniaA-AFC211CB) and worsening cognitive impairment.​[[25]](#CorteseMMungerKLMartiez-LapiscinaEH-5836B38E) As such, all health-care providers should encourage patients to quit smoking (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). Treating physical and psychological comorbidities may also have an impact on MS progression.​[[26]](#c0127n05016)

There is evidence to support autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for patients with relapsing MS refractory to disease-modifying therapy.​[[27]](#MillerAEChitnisTCohenBAEtAl.Autolog) Significant risk of mortality warrants a thoughtful risk-benefit assessment.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Short courses of high-dose corticosteroids, e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3–5 days, are sometimes used to reduce the severity and duration of acute relapses but do not alter the disease progression. The optimal dose and route of administration have not been established, and varied protocols are in use across the spectrum of care delivery centres.​[[28]](#c0127n01143) Although there is increasing evidence that a regimen of high-dose oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1000 mg PO daily for 5 days) is as effective as the IV regimen,​[[29]](#c0127n9873)​[[30]](#c0127n9872) GI intolerance limits its use.​[[31]](#c0127n9874) A subsequent taper with oral corticosteroids is not required after a short course of IV or PO high-dose therapy.​[[32]](#c0127n01142)

The following discussion focuses on disease-modifying therapies for MS (see [Table 5](#c0127n01147),[Table 6](#c0127n00021) and [Figure 1](#c0127n00020)). Information on management of various MS-related symptoms or associated conditions can be found in [Table 7](#c0127n01114) and Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Schizophrenia and Related Psychotic Disorders, Chronic Spasticity, Neuropathic Pain, Urinary Incontinence in Adults and Male Sexual Dysfunction.

### First-Line Disease-Modifying Therapies

Although there is no known cure for MS, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been shown to reduce the rate of relapses in RRMS by approximately 40%, which may ultimately reduce/delay disease progression.​[[33]](#KalincikTDioufISharminSEtAl.EffectO) Expert opinion supports the notion of a therapeutic window—that DMT initiated within 5 years of diagnosis may significantly delay disease progression.​[[34]](#ColesAJCoxALePageEEtAl)​[[35]](#BrownJWLColesAHorakovaDEtAl.Associa-14D801D3) Since they work on inflammation associated with relapses, DMTs have little or no effect on primary or secondary progressive MS, for which there is little or no inflammation, except in cases of active progressive disease where frequent relapses continue to occur.

First-line DMTs are typically immunomodulators rather than immunosuppressants; they are less aggressive than second-line therapy (also known as high-efficacy therapy), which may be more effective, but also have a greater risk of toxicity. This approach to MS therapy is known as *escalation therapy* and is typically preferred for most mild-moderate presentations. See [Table 5](#c0127n01147) for more information on first-line DMTs.

Interferon beta, a naturally occurring immunomodulator delivered via injection, was the first DMT approved for the treatment of MS. It reduces the frequency of relapses and the size/number of lesions detectable on MRI​[[36]](#c0127n01075)​[[37]](#c0127n01076) and reduces the rate of conversion to clinically definite MS following an initial clinically isolated syndrome from 45–50% to 28–35% over 2–3 years.​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C)​[[38]](#c0127n1024)​[[39]](#c0127n1025)​[[40]](#c0127n1026) The most common side effects associated with interferon treatment include local injection site reactions and flulike symptoms.​[[41]](#c0127n1033) The development of neutralizing antibodies can diminish the clinical response to interferon therapy.​[[36]](#c0127n01075)​[[37]](#c0127n01076)

Glatiramer **acetate** is another injectable immunomodulator with effects similar to interferon beta on reduction in relapse rates and MRI-detectable lesion burden in RRMS.​[[4]](#c0127n1004)​[[42]](#c0127n1034) Glatiramer may also reduce the rate of conversion to clinically definite MS following a clinically isolated syndrome.​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C) Its proposed mechanism of action involves inhibition of myelin reactive T cells, decreased T-cell proliferation and decreased interferon-gamma secretion.​[[43]](#c0127n1030)​[[44]](#c0127n1032)​[[45]](#c0127n1035) Overall, glatiramer is well tolerated with few side effects, although lipoatrophy at the site of injection may be significant.

Dimethyl fumarate is an oral immunomodulator indicated for management of RRMS. Though its exact mechanism of action is unknown, dimethyl fumarate activates the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to decrease the proportion of patients who had relapsed at 2 years by around 40%, reduce the annualized relapse rate by 53%, and decrease the number of new or enlarging brain lesions.​[[46]](#c0127n96321) Common side effects include flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Decreased lymphocytes, proteinuria, increased liver enzymes and liver injury can also occur.

Teriflunomide is an oral immune modulator that reduces the activity of T- and B-cells through inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase–mediated pyrimidine synthesis. Teriflunomide has been shown to reduce the annualized relapse rate by approximately 50% and the proportion of patients with confirmed disease progression by about 25% in clinical trials.​[[47]](#c0127n01139)​[[48]](#c0127n01141)​[[49]](#c0127n01140) Because of its favourable safety profile, teriflunomide is now considered a common first choice. It is important to note, however, its teratogenicity and that teriflunomide may not be an ideal drug of choice for patients with plans to conceive (see [Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding](#c0127n00017)).

### Second-Line Disease-Modifying Therapies

When 1 or more first-line DMTs have failed or are not tolerated, second-line DMTs, also known as high-efficacy therapies, can be considered. These agents are typically more effective than first-line therapy, but also more toxic; therefore, they are reserved as second-line options for patients who require escalation of therapy. Alternatively, patients with highly active disease may warrant special consideration for initial treatment with high-efficacy therapies.​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C)​[[50]](#FreedmanMSDevonshireVDuqettePEtAl.T-583D8D39) This approach is known as *early intensive therapy*, as opposed to *escalation therapy* previously discussed. Although the evidence base for early intensive therapy is steadily growing, this approach is not yet commonly practiced.​[[35]](#BrownJWLColesAHorakovaDEtAl.Associa-14D801D3)​[[51]](#HeAMerkelBBrownJWLEtAl.TimingOfHigh-583D7374)​[[52]](#HardingKWilliamsOWillisMEtA)​[[53]](#DueBuronMChalmerTASellebjergFEtA) See [Table 6](#c0127n00021) for more information on second-line DMTs.

Alemtuzumab is an injectable monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52 on activated lymphocytes and targets their destruction. This leads to a reduction in sustained accumulation of disability and relapse rates in patients with RRMS. Twenty-two to 35% of patients treated with alemtuzumab experienced relapse compared with 40–50% of patients for interferon beta–treated patients.​[[54]](#c0127n01130)​[[55]](#c0127n01131) Health Canada has published a safety alert regarding life-threatening and fatal cases of autoimmune hepatitis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiovascular reactions in patients receiving alemtuzumab for RRMS.​[[56]](#HealthCanada.Lemtradaalemtuzumab-Ri-9B80D977) Hepatic, hematological and cardiovascular monitoring is required for 4 years after the last administered dose. Accordingly, alemtuzumab should be initiated only in patients with highly active disease who have failed ≥2 other DMTs or have no other treatment options.

Cladribine is taken as an oral short-course cyclic treatment, it gradually and temporarily depletes B and T lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte reconstitution, thus not causing continuous immune suppression. It has been shown to be effective for reducing relapse rates, the risk of disability progression and MRI measures of disease activity.​[[57]](#c0127n4444) Safety concerns are mainly associated with higher grade lymphopenia, which is linked to herpes zoster infection.​[[58]](#c0127n3333)​[[59]](#c0127n2222) Cladribine should be considered only in patients with MS who are unable to tolerate or have inadequate response to 1 or more therapies for MS.

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that blocks the egress of activated, presumably autoimmune, lymphocytes into the circulating bloodstream from lymphoid tissues.​[[60]](#c0127n1055) Phase III clinical trials showed oral fingolimod was well tolerated and effective in reducing annualized relapse rates by ~50% and MRI-detected inflammatory activity in patients with RRMS.​[[61]](#c0127n01125)​[[62]](#c0127n01126) Precautions include increased risk of macular edema, bradycardia, varicella-zoster infection, skin cancer and reversible hepatic dysfunction. Certain precautions are necessary with fingolimod therapy; see [Table 6](#c0127n00021) for specific monitoring parameters. Siponimod, ozanimod and ponesimod are also S1P modulators that have been more recently approved for the management of MS. These agents modulate specific subtypes of S1P receptors, offering a theoretical reduction in adverse effects. Ozanimod and ponesimod are indicated for the treatment of RRMS.

Siponimod is approved for the treatment of active SPMS. It should be used only in SPMS patients with active MS flares, as identified by gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Other SPMS patients without active disease may not achieve the same clinical benefits.​[[63]](#KapposLBar-OrACreeBACEtAl.Siponimod-58426FC6) Judicious prescribing of this medication by physicians well versed in MS disease pathology is warranted.

Natalizumab is an alpha-4 integrin antagonist/adhesion molecule inhibitor indicated for the treatment of RRMS.​[[64]](#c0127n1045) Natalizumab blocks the attachment of T cells to the blood-brain barrier, which precedes their infiltration into the CNS in the early inflammatory stages of MS.​[[65]](#c0127n1046) Natalizumab reduces annualized relapse rates by 68%,​[[64]](#c0127n1045) with a 92% reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions.​[[66]](#c0127n01167) Natalizumab is associated with hypersensitivity reactions and, a significant risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); see [Table 3](#RiskOfProgressiveMultifocalLeukoenc). Because PML, though rare, is a seriously disabling and potentially fatal CNS infection, natalizumab is recommended for use in patients who are unresponsive to or cannot tolerate first-line DMTs.​[[67]](#c0127n1051)

Ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20 B cells, is the only DMT conditionally approved since 2018 in Canada for active PPMS that has demonstrated lower rates of clinical and MRI progression.​[[68]](#c0127n01051) Ocrelizumab is also approved for RRMS; when compared to interferon beta-1a, ocrelizumab was associated with lower rates of disease activity and progression.​[[69]](#c0127n05019) Adverse effects include infusion reactions, infections and a possible increase in the risk of neoplasm.​[[68]](#c0127n01051)​[[69]](#c0127n05019) The long-term safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab remain to be determined. Based on its risk-benefit profile, ocrelizumab is not typically considered as a first-line option for RRMS, especially if disease activity is not severe. Ofatumumab, another monoclonal antibody against CD20 B cells, was approved for the treatment of RRMS in 2021 based on efficacy data from 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrating lower relapse rates compared to patients taking teriflunomide.​[[70]](#HauserSLBar-OrACohenJAEtAl.Ofatumum) However, caution must be exercised with its use until its place in MS therapy has been established following widespread use.

Daclizumab was withdrawn from the market worldwide due to cases of immune-mediated encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.​[[71]](#c0127n05034)

### Other Therapies

Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that is generally not recommended for the treatment of MS.​[[72]](#c0127n1040)​[[73]](#c0127n1041) It is reserved for use by MS specialists as an off-label last resort for patients with rapidly advancing disease who have failed all other therapy options.​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C)​[[74]](#c0127n1044) Serious potential adverse effects including cardiotoxicity​[[75]](#c0127n1042) and leukemia​[[76]](#c0127n1043) require thoughtful assessment of risk-benefit ratio.

Fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is approved in Canada to improve walking ability in patients with MS. As a selective blocker of a subset of voltage-activated potassium channels with little or no effect on sodium or calcium channels, fampridine directly targets the nervous system, apparently by increasing the ability of action potentials to traverse demyelinated areas of the axon without losing strength.​[[77]](#c0127n1052) A phase III study using sustained-release oral fampridine showed significantly greater improvement in walking speed compared with placebo (35% vs. 8%).​[[78]](#c0127n1053) Improvement of ambulatory function in gait-impaired MS patients was persistent over a period of 2 years in a long-term efficacy monitoring study, and data showed good tolerability.​[[79]](#c0127n9456)

Several MS-related complications may arise that require attention and pharmacologic management (e.g., spasticity, urinary incontinence, neuropathic pain). See Chronic Spasticity, Urinary Incontinence in Adults and Neuropathic Pain for more information. Medicinal **cannabinoids** are minimally effective for the treatment of spasticity, urinary incontinence and pain in MS patients.​[[80]](#Torres-MorenoMCPapaseitETorrensMEtA-14D91B2B)

### Risk of Infection

Patients with MS may be at increased risk of severe infection, due to both their condition and the immunosuppressive effects of some DMT (see [Table 2](#DMT-immunosuppression-risk)).​[[81]](#LunaGAlpingPBurmanJEtAl.InfectionRi-7132EEFE)

While it is generally recommended to continue DMT when patients develop a mild viral infection, temporarily stopping or delaying DMT in patients with worsening symptoms of viral infection, other risk factors (e.g., older age, comorbidities) and/or those taking more immunosuppressive DMT may be considered. It is important to keep in mind that abrupt discontinuation of some DMT (natalizumab and fingolimod) may result in potentially severe rebound disease activity.

**Table 2:** Disease-Modifying Therapy and Risk of Immunosuppression​[[81]](#LunaGAlpingPBurmanJEtAl.InfectionRi-7132EEFE)

| Risk of Immunosuppression | Disease-Modifying Therapy |
| --- | --- |
| Higher risk | Alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, mitoxantrone |
| Moderate risk | Dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, siponimod, teriflunomide |
| Lower risk | Interferon-beta, glatiramer, natalizumab |

In this section, a few considerations, including risk of PML, COVID-19 and vaccine management, are highlighted.

### Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

With the use of DMT becoming more widespread, cases of PML have been reported in association with these agents.​[[82]](#c0127n9123) Caused by the neurotrophic polyoma JC virus, PML is a rare but devastating infection of the CNS, causing demyelination in the CNS and death in many cases. For more information, see [Table 3](#RiskOfProgressiveMultifocalLeukoenc).

**Table 3:** Risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy with Multiple Sclerosis Therapy​[[82]](#c0127n9123)​[[83]](#FaulknerM.RiskOfProgressiveMultifoc-D7794BF3)

| Risk Level | Pharmacologic Agent |
| --- | --- |
| Highest | Natalizumab Associated with 0.5% risk of PML that increases with the number of infusions and duration of therapy if used concurrently with, or subsequent to, interferon beta or other immunomodulating drugs and in patients who test positive for anti–JC virus antibodies.​ [83] ​ [84] ​ [85] ​ [86] Some clinicians use a drug holiday for patients on natalizumab for periods longer than 12–16 months as a non-proven measure to minimize PML risk. After 18 months, JCV antibody measurement is recommended to determine safety of extending course of treatment.​ [50] Extended interval dosing (35–43 days vs 30 days) may also reduce risk.​ [87] |
| Isolated cases, potential for risk | Dimethyl fumarate​ [88] Fingolimod​ [83] Ocrelizumab​ [89] Ofatumumab​ [90] |
| Low, no reported cases | Cladribine Glatiramer Interferon beta Teriflunomide |
| Unknown | Ozanimod Ponesimod Siponimod |

### Coronavirus Disease 2019

To date, limited information regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with MS taking DMT has been published. A relatively large registry of MS patients in Italy (n=844) was able to detect that anti-CD20 therapy (e.g., ocrelizumab) and recent corticosteroid exposure (<30 days) were both associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection.​[[91]](#SormaniMPDeRossiNSchiavettiIEtAl.D) Patients should not stop taking DMT without the consultation of their MS health-care provider. Initiating treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic with DMT may be reconsidered or delayed, depending on patient risk factors, MS disease activity and the immunosuppressive risk of the drug.​[[92]](#BrownleeWBourdetteDBroadleySEtAl.Tr-713BB99F)​[[93]](#MSSocietyOfCanada.Disease-modifying-713C2593) The COVID-19 situation is evolving, and global data collection is ongoing. The evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 on MS patients taking DMT will be reviewed as it becomes available.

### Immunization

As previously discussed, patients with MS may have an increased risk of infection. Therefore, immunization against vaccine-preventable infections is essential. See [Table 4](#ImmunizationRecommendationsForPatie-) for a summary of recommendations regarding vaccination of patients with MS.

**Table 4:** Immunization Recommendations for Patients with MS​[[94]](#FarezMCorrealeJArmstrongMEtAl.Pract-713F4FD4)​[[95]](#MSSocietyOfCanada.VaccinationsInter-714BE00B)

| Recommendation | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Administer eligible vaccines immediately after multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, or 4–6 wk before initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). | Response to vaccines may be attenuated due to DMT (with the exception of interferons).​ [96] Patients may also be ineligible to receive live vaccines, depending on the DMT. |
| After initiation of DMT, administer vaccines according to the Canadian Immunization Guide , which includes guidance on vaccination of patients on immunosuppressive therapy. | Most vaccines do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MS exacerbation. |
| Live vaccines should not be administered to MS patients in general, particularly in those who are on DMT with a moderate-high risk of immunosuppression. | DMT with a moderate-high risk of immunosuppression may increase risk of infection if a live-attenuated vaccine is administered. |
| Vaccines should not be administered during an MS relapse. | Although there is minimal evidence to support this practice, out of an abundance of caution, vaccine is usually withheld until the patient is stable. |
| Some highly immunosuppressive therapies have particular time frames within which vaccines, including inactivated vaccines, may or may not be administered. | DMT that requires specific timing of vaccine administration:​ [97] alemtuzumab cladribine fingolimod,ozanimod, ponesimod, siponimod high-dose corticosteroid therapy ocrelizumab ofatumumab |

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Multiple Sclerosis and Pregnancy

Patients diagnosed with MS who become pregnant have been reported to have a period of decreased disease activity during the course of their pregnancy.​[[98]](#HoutchensMKEdwardsNCPhillipsAL.Rela-14DAAED2) This phenomenon has been observed in other immune-mediated disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is believed to result from changes in the immune system that are necessary to prevent an immune response to the non-self tissue of the fetus.​[[99]](#c0127n1063) However, following delivery of the baby, patients are more likely to experience a relapse, particularly if the relapse rate prior to pregnancy was high.​[[100]](#c0127n1064) Although several studies have attempted to pharmacologically mimic the hormonal fluctuations believed to be responsible for the quiescence of MS during pregnancy, results have been inconclusive.​[[101]](#c0127n1065) One series of clinical trials showed a beneficial effect of sex-hormone therapy in female patients with both RRMS and SPMS.​[[102]](#c0127n1066) The study showed a significant reduction in both T helper cells and inflammatory markers of disease activity in patients treated with estradiol.​[[103]](#c0127n1067)

Patients considering a planned pregnancy are strongly advised to discuss their pharmacologic options prior to commencing treatment with any DMT. Fingolimod and natalizumab, in particular, may not be ideal choices in patients of childbearing age due to risk of severe rebound of disease activity if abruptly discontinued (due to an unplanned pregnancy).​[[104]](#SepulvedaMMontejoCLlufriuSEtAl.Rebo-5848B232) Patients of all genders may consider deferring treatment with DMT until after the planned pregnancy occurs.​[[19]](#Rae-GrantADayGSMarrieRAEtAl.Practic-F747BC1C)

### Management of Multiple Sclerosis during Pregnancy

The use of DMT in pregnancy is not routinely advised.​[[105]](#c0127n1068) Teriflunomide, cladribine and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators are teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients of childbearing potential who are not using reliable birth control. Patients who conceive while taking teriflunomide are advised to undergo a drug washout regimen using cholestyramine to enhance elimination. Details of this procedure may be found in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

Though there are no definitive guidelines recommending the discontinuation of other DMTs prior to conception, clinical experience and anecdotal reports generally support stopping therapy 2–6 months prior to conception.​[[50]](#FreedmanMSDevonshireVDuqettePEtAl.T-583D8D39)​[[106]](#c0127n1069) This precautionary recommendation applies to patients of all genders with MS who are considering starting a family. Though studies of small numbers of pregnant patients have suggested the use of interferon beta or glatiramer during pregnancy is not linked to an increased risk of birth defects,​[[107]](#c0127n1070)​[[108]](#c0127n1071)​[[109]](#c0127n1072)​[[110]](#FragosoYD.GlatiramerAcetateToTreatM-C80ECFF6) the treating physician and patient must always weigh the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment during pregnancy.

Corticosteroids may be used for severe relapses during pregnancy; however, utmost caution is required during the first trimester, as they are associated with a <1% increased risk of cleft palate.​[[50]](#FreedmanMSDevonshireVDuqettePEtAl.T-583D8D39)​[[111]](#Park-WyllieLMazzottaPPastuszak)

### Multiple Sclerosis and Breastfeeding

Though infants might be exposed to immunomodulators via breast milk, no significant risk associated with breastfeeding during immunomodulator therapy has been reported.​[[106]](#c0127n1069) Because breastfeeding during the postpartum period may actually have a protective effect on the breastfeeding patient in terms of relapse,​[[112]](#HellwigKRockhoffMHerbstrittS.Exclus-C80E21F1)​[[113]](#Langer-GouldASmithJBAlbersKBEtAl.Pr-5845CEBE) most clinicians favour the cessation of DMT during breastfeeding to avoid possible adverse effects on the developing infant.​[[114]](#c0127n1074) If medication is required, some experts recommend glatiramer acetate and interferon as safe options in breastfeeding patients.​[[115]](#DobsonRDassanPRobertsMEtAl.UKConsen-5847F3FE) Corticosteroids can be used for acute relapses if necessary.​[[116]](#c0127n01144)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- RRMS is the most common form of MS and is most likely to respond to DMT.
- Though there is no cure for MS, the decision to treat early with DMT is associated with improved long-term neurologic outcomes and quality of life when compared with the natural disease course resulting from no treatment.​[[40]](#c0127n1026)
- All MS patients able to tolerate vitamin D should commence therapy with a supplement (at least 1000 units per day), especially if their levels are low. While there is little evidence of benefit from vitamin D supplementation for MS, there are other potential benefits and no known risk of harm.​[[117]](#EvansEPiccioLCrossAH.UseOfVitaminsA-F77ABBAC)​[[118]](#JagannathVAFedorowiczZAsokanGVEtAl.-14D9DEEA)
- Start treatment with the endpoint in mind, understanding the strengths and limitations of each therapy. For example, most DMTs are not effective for progressive patients without relapse, and MS-specific therapy may not be required for patients with a history of clinically isolated syndrome who remain stable clinically and radiographically.
- Abrupt discontinuation of fingolimod and natalizumab may result in severe rebound of disease activity.
