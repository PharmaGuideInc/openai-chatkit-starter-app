### Introduction

Dyspepsia, defined as pain or discomfort located in the upper abdomen, is one of the most common reasons patients consult their family physician.​[[1]](#c0046n00262) Other symptoms associated with dyspepsia include nausea, vomiting, fullness, early satiety and bloating. Dyspepsia is the cardinal symptom of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), which refers to the development of breaks in the mucosa of the stomach (gastric ulcers [GU]) and/or proximal duodenum (duodenal ulcers [DU]). For the purpose of this review, heartburn and regurgitation are considered symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) versus dyspepsia. GERD is addressed in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

Dyspepsia occurs in about 25% of people over the course of any year.​[[2]](#c0046n00127)​[[3]](#c0046n00153) Endoscopic findings accounting for dyspeptic symptoms will be present in approximately 25% of persons with dyspepsia. PUD is the most common cause of dyspepsia that is evident on endoscopy;​[[4]](#c0046n00154) less common findings include upper GI tract Crohn disease, celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal candidiasis and cytomegalovirus-related ulceration. Some patients with GERD will present with dyspepsia as a predominant symptom. In the absence of alarm signs and symptoms (see [Investigations](#c0046n00003)), the likelihood of detecting malignancy as a cause of the dyspepsia is low.​[[5]](#c0046n00253)​[[6]](#c0046n00254)

Approximately 75% of patients with chronic dyspepsia (dyspepsia lasting for at least 3 of the previous 6 months) will have a normal upper GI tract upon endoscopic examination. This group of subjects with chronic dyspepsia and normal endoscopic findings are often referred to as having nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) or functional dyspepsia (FD).​[[4]](#c0046n00154) FD can be further subdivided into 2 subtypes: epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), characterized by upper abdominal pain and discomfort not distinctly related to food intake; and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), typified by upper abdominal discomfort or fullness following a meal.​[[4]](#c0046n00154)

As the nature and severity of the symptoms do not significantly differ between persons with PUD and FD, it is not possible to reliably differentiate between these syndromes without performing endoscopy or other imaging. However, differentiation of FD from PUD is not crucial to the initial management of persons with dyspepsia in the absence of alarm signs and symptoms and may not be necessary if symptoms resolve as a result of the initial management.​[[7]](#c0046n00255)

Lifetime prevalence of PUD is about 10% in North Americans but the incidence of PUD is decreasing over time.​[[8]](#c0046n00256)​[[9]](#c0046n00257) The most common risk factors for the development of PUD are infection with Helicobacter pylori or the use of NSAIDs, including low-dose ASA. However, 5–20% of patients with GU/DU have no evidence of either H. pylori or NSAID use.​[[10]](#c0046n00258)

This chapter considers:

1. Uninvestigated dyspepsia
2. Dyspepsia with normal endoscopy (NUD or functional dyspepsia)
3. Treatment of PUD due to H. pylori infection
4. Prevention and treatment of PUD during ASA or NSAID therapy

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve and prevent symptoms of dyspepsia
- Treat underlying H. pylori as a potential cause of dyspepsia
- Treat active PUD and prevent recurrence of PUD
- Prevent PUD-related complications in users of NSAIDs and ASA

### Investigations

- History and physical examination:

  - Exclude non-GI sources of pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, e.g., ischemic heart disease, pulmonary disease.
  - Take a drug history (including the use of over-the-counter medications, herbs and supplements) focusing on NSAID or ASA use (including low-dose ASA) as well as other medications that may cause or aggravate dyspepsia, such as bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, erythromycin, iron salts, metronidazole, tetracyclines and opioids (particularly codeine).
  - Identify any “red flags” (new onset >60 years of age; alarm signs and symptoms such as abdominal mass, vomiting, bleeding, dysphagia, anemia or unexplained weight loss), which may be associated with rare but serious causes such as esophageal or gastric cancer.
  - Identify those with predominant reflux-like symptoms (e.g., heartburn, regurgitation) because they are more likely to respond to empiric PPI therapy.
  - Physical examination will usually be normal; epigastric tenderness is a common but nonspecific finding.
- Investigations for underlying causes of dyspepsia:

  - Patients under 60 years of age who do not have alarm signs and symptoms (intractable vomiting, bleeding, anemia, weight loss, dysphagia) do not require specific investigations and can be initially managed empirically.
  - Endoscopy provides a visual of the esophagus, stomach and upper small intestine; a biopsy may also be taken during the procedure. Endoscopy is the most sensitive and specific means to diagnose the cause of dyspepsia; however, not every person with dyspeptic symptoms requires prompt endoscopy.​[[7]](#c0046n00255)​[[11]](#c0046n00259) Endoscopy is most appropriate in new-onset dyspeptic patients over 55 years of age, or those with one or more of the aforementioned alarm signs and symptoms. Endoscopy may also be used to confirm functional dyspepsia and rule out other more rare causes of dyspepsia if patients fail to respond to empiric management. The disadvantages of endoscopy include scarcity of gastroenterologists to perform the procedure, cost, time lost from work, and risk of complications such as aspiration or perforation (about 1 in 5000 procedures).
  - Upper GI barium study has an approximately 20% false-positive and false-negative rate for detection of ulcer disease and is generally not recommended, especially in those with red flags.​[[12]](#c0046n00260)​[[13]](#c0046n00261) However, barium studies may be more readily available than upper endoscopy and are still used to reassure the physician that nothing serious has been missed as a cause of the dyspepsia. Choosing Wisely Canada recommends against performing barium studies for the investigation of dyspepsia.
  - A CT scan of the abdomen may be considered to rule out the presence of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer if patient experiences unrelenting upper abdominal pain accompanied by weight loss, jaundice or pain radiating to the back.

### Investigations for H. pylori infection:

- H. pylori infection may cause or worsen dyspepsia independent of the presence of ulceration. About 30% of Canadians with dyspepsia will have evidence of active H. pylori infection in the stomach.​[[14]](#Thomson2003)
- A test-and-treat strategy (testing for H. pylori and eradicating it if present) is advocated as first-line management when the regional prevalence of H. pylori is ≥20%, since approximately 50% of patients with dyspepsia who are H. pylori–positive will respond to eradicative therapy.​[[15]](#c0046n00152)
- Tests for H. pylori include:

  - Noninvasive tests:

    - Serology: assessment of *H. pylori* IgG serology is appropriate if there has been no prior attempt at H. pylori eradication. H. pylori serology may remain persistently positive for several years after successful eradication and represent a false-positive result.​[[16]](#c0046n00150)​[[17]](#Best2018Cochrane)
    - Urea breath testing (UBT): the UBT is a highly sensitive and specific test for H. pylori.​[[17]](#Best2018Cochrane) A patient is given a solution of radiolabelled urea (​13C or ​14C) to drink; if H. pylori is present, the urea is metabolized to radiolabelled carbon dioxide, which can be detected in the breath.​[[18]](#c0046n00094) The main disadvantage of UBT is that patients must discontinue antibiotics or bismuth for 1 month and PPIs or histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for at least 1 week prior to the test to avoid a false-negative test result.​[[19]](#c0046n00280)​[[20]](#c0046n00281)​[[21]](#c0046n00283)​[[22]](#c0046n00284) Access to UBT may also present a challenge, as it is available only at centres that have nuclear medicine facilities; however, there is now a ​13C UBT available (the “Helikit”) that allows patients to collect their breath sample at home and send it to a lab for analysis. The Helikit is available online and the manufacturer reports 98% sensitivity, 95% specificity and 96% overall diagnostic accuracy.
    - Stool antigen testing: H. pylori antigens can be detected in the stool in the presence of active infection. Stool antigen testing is highly specific but is slightly less sensitive than UBT.​[[17]](#Best2018Cochrane) The main disadvantage of this test is that it requires collection of a stool specimen.​[[23]](#c0046n00095) Its accuracy is also affected by concomitant acid-inhibiting therapy.
  - Invasive tests:

    - Endoscopy: biopsy samples taken during endoscopy can either be examined histologically or through a rapid urease test (RUT) for the presence of H. pylori. Endoscopy is considered the gold standard for detection of H. pylori, but noninvasive testing is preferred unless the endoscopy is being performed for other reasons, e.g., to assess healing of a gastric ulcer.

### Initial Non-Endoscopic Management of Dyspepsia

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0046n00008) presents an approach to the management of dyspepsia in persons under 60 years of age in the absence of alarm signs and symptoms and [Table 2](#c0046n00018) includes drugs used for dyspepsia.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

General lifestyle modification is the first approach for the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia.

- Recommend moderation if dyspepsia is worsened by consuming a particular food or beverage (e.g., coffee, orange juice, alcohol, spicy foods, fatty foods), eating large meals or eating on the run.
- Recommend avoiding use of nonprescription medications containing ASA or NSAIDs, which may cause dyspepsia or PUD.

### Pharmacologic Choices

- Initial pharmacologic management of dyspepsia in the absence of alarm signs and symptoms focuses on testing for H. pylori and eradicating it if present (test and treat) or empirically treating symptoms with a standard-dose PPI for 4–8 weeks. The test-and-treat strategy is cost-effective if the prevalence of H. pylori in the regional patient population is ≥20% or not known. If the prevalence of H. pylori is <20%, empirical PPI therapy may be considered as a first-line option.​[[16]](#c0046n00150) [Table 1](#c0046n00013) outlines H. pylori eradication regimens.
- If dyspepsia resolves after an attempt to eradicate H. pylori, no further therapy is required.
- If dyspepsia persists despite an attempt at H. pylori eradication, a 4–8 week trial of PPI therapy should be considered.
- If dyspepsia returns following an attempt to eradicate H. pylori, then UBT or H. pylori stool antigen testing; serology should not be used to assess eradication. If H. pylori is still present, a different H. pylori eradication regimen should be followed. If H. pylori eradication is confirmed, a 4–8 week trial of PPI therapy should be considered.
- If dyspepsia resolves following empiric PPI therapy, consider discontinuing the PPI with or without initiating step-down therapy with a daily H2RA.​[[25]](#c0046n00172) If dyspepsia symptoms persist or if there are frequent recurrences, investigate for H. pylori infection or reinfection (if previous attempt at eradication) with a UBT or stool antigen testing.
- If dyspepsia is persistent or frequently recurrent despite confirmed H. pylori eradication and a trial of PPI therapy, refer to a gastroenterologist or qualified endoscopist for upper endoscopy consideration.

. . . . .

### Dyspepsia with Normal Endoscopy

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Reassure and educate patients about the benign nature of this condition.
- Advise patients that avoiding high-fat meals/foods that exacerbate symptoms and eating frequent smaller meals may be helpful.
- Consider psychological therapy if there is an overlying mood disorder of anxiety (see Anxiety Disorders).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Chronic dyspepsia with normal endoscopic findings may be referred to as functional dyspepsia. Symptomatic management of functional dyspepsia is challenging and is often unsuccessful. Reconsider diagnosis in patients with resistant symptoms.

- Empiric treatment with a **PPI** or **H2RA** for 4–8 weeks is reasonable if not already attempted (see [Table 2](#c0046n00018)); however, response rates for PPIs are only 10% higher than response rates with placebo.​[[26]](#refitem-1242137-0CFA7F4B)​[[27]](#c0046n00245)​[[28]](#c0046n00188) On-demand therapy with PPIs or H2RAs may also be appropriate for patients with mild or intermittent symptoms.
- H. pylori eradication may eliminate 5–10% more cases of dyspepsia compared with placebo.​[[29]](#c0046n00250)​[[30]](#c0046n00251)
- H. pylori eradication and/or PPI therapy may be more effective for EPS than for PDS.
- Promotility agents metoclopramide and domperidone may be more likely to produce symptomatic improvement compared with placebo, particularly in persons with PDS.

  - Metoclopramide can lead to potentially irreversible neurologic symptoms and should be discontinued at the first sign of dystonia, tremor or muscle stiffness.​[[31]](#Pittayanon2019)
  - Domperidone may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia, particularly if there is prolongation of the QT-interval. A baseline EKG should be obtained prior to starting domperidone.​[[32]](#Leelakanok2016)
- Neuromodulators, including tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline), mirtazapine​[[33]](#Tack2016) and buspirone,​[[34]](#Tack2012) may offer some symptomatic benefit, especially in persons with EPS.​[[35]](#c0046n00186)​[[36]](#refitem-1242145-0CFAD7B7)​[[37]](#Cheong2018)
- Most studies in functional dyspepsia only evaluated short-term (<12 wk) courses of therapy. There is little evidence for long-term therapy in patients with functional dyspepsia. The benefits of therapy must be weighed against the potential risks associated with long-term medication use.

### Treatment of PUD due to Helicobacter pylori Infection

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

Successful treatment of H. pylori (see [Table 1](#c0046n00013)) will result in ulcer healing and will prevent the development of recurrent PUD (in the absence of concomitant ASA or NSAID use).

### Eradication of H. pylori

- The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend quadruple therapy for 14 days as first-line management in the eradication of H. pylori infection.​[[24]](#refitem-1212141-960D2496) The recommended quadruple therapy regimens include:

  - any of the PPIs, amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin BID for 14 days
  - any of the PPIs BID, bismuth subsalicylate QID, metronidazole TID–QID and tetracycline QID for 14 days
- Traditional triple therapy (PPI, clarithromycin, plus either amoxicillin or metronidazole) should be used only in areas where clarithromycin resistance is known to be <15%. Triple therapy with PPI, amoxicillin and metronidazole has been shown to be inferior to triple therapy regimens containing clarithromycin and should be used only in areas with demonstrated recent and ongoing success. If triple therapy is used at all, it should be given for 14 days.​[[24]](#refitem-1212141-960D2496)
- The above regimens are approved by the Canadian Helicobacter Study Group and achieve a minimum eradication rate (on an intention-to-treat basis) of at least 85%.​[[24]](#refitem-1212141-960D2496)
- After successful H. pylori eradication, the risk of reinfection is about 1% per year.
- Assess eradication in patients with a history of complications of PUD (bleeding, perforation, obstruction) and in those with ongoing or recurrent symptoms of dyspepsia. Follow-up testing to confirm H. pylori eradication may be through UBT, stool antigen testing or histology (see [Investigations](#c0046n00003)).
- In patients with complicated ulcers (e.g., bleeding, perforation, severe symptoms) or severe PUD-related complications, continue therapy with PPIs until eradication of H. pylori is confirmed.
- If H. pylori is not successfully eradicated, the regimen of PPI, bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole and tetracycline is the preferred second line if the regimen of PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole was used first line. If the bismuth regimen fails as first-line therapy, initiate second-line therapy of PPI, amoxicillin and levofloxacin.​[[24]](#refitem-1212141-960D2496)

The recommended regimens are outlined in [Table 1](#c0046n00013).

### Prevention of PUD during ASA or NSAID Therapy

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 2](#c0046n00018) includes drugs used in the management of PUD.

- Consider indefinite use of a gastroprotective agent for all patients on chronic ASA or NSAID therapy who have risk factors for PUD:​[[38]](#c0046n00180)

  - >65 years of age
  - use of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs
  - concomitant use of corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, ticagrelor), anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants) or SSRIs
  - severe medical comorbidity, e.g., heart failure, COPD, chronic renal or hepatic disease, advanced malignancy
  - history of gastric or duodenal ulcer or upper GI bleeding
- Accepted gastroprotective strategies include once-daily PPIs, misoprostol 800 mcg daily (in 4 divided doses) and substitution of a traditional NSAID with a COX-2 inhibitor.​[[39]](#c0046n00242)
- Standard-dose PPIs are more efficacious than standard-dose histamine H2-receptor antagonists (**H2RAs**) or misoprostol 400 mcg daily (in 2 divided doses) but not misoprostol 800 mcg daily (in 4 divided doses) for the prevention of NSAID-associated gastric and duodenal ulcers.​[[40]](#c0046n00179)​[[41]](#c0046n00191)
- Eradication of H. pylori prior to the initiation of ASA or NSAID therapy may reduce the risk of symptomatic ulcers.​[[42]](#c0046n00178)
- Compared with regular NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors may have a 50–70% lower risk of causing complicated peptic ulcer bleeding;​[[43]](#c0046n00177)​[[44]](#Bakhriansyah2017) however, reports of cardiovascular complications with the use of COX-2 inhibitors have limited their use and challenged their safety.​[[45]](#c0046n00174) Celecoxib (the only COX-2 inhibitor available in Canada) should not be used in persons with established cardiovascular disease. However, all NSAIDs have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications,​[[46]](#refitem-1192153-CE09DEB5) and a meta-analysis of individual patient data studying real-world settings demonstrated that traditional NSAIDs and celecoxib are associated with a comparable increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.​[[47]](#refitem-1192154-CE09DFF2)

. . . . .

### Treatment of PUD during ASA or NSAID Therapy

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 2](#c0046n00018) includes drugs used in the management of PUD.

- When appropriate, stop ASA or NSAID therapy.
- Treat PUD in those using ASA or NSAIDs with standard-dose PPIs. **H2RAs** and misoprostol are less-effective alternatives.​[[40]](#c0046n00179)​[[41]](#c0046n00191)
- Treatment may be stopped 8 weeks after discontinuation of ASA or NSAIDs.
- If low-dose ASA is indicated for cardiovascular prophylaxis, it should not be discontinued; however, concomitant PPI therapy should continue as long as the patient remains on ASA.​[[48]](#c0046n00175)​[[49]](#c0046n00198)
- If NSAIDs cannot be discontinued, continue PPI therapy.
- If PUD was associated with bleeding, continuation of an NSAID is associated with a 5% risk of recurrent bleeding ulcer at 1 year despite PPI use.​[[50]](#c0046n00199) If NSAIDs cannot be discontinued, use of a COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI affords the greatest protection against recurrent PUD.​[[50]](#c0046n00199)
- All patients with PUD (including those using ASA or an NSAID) should be tested for H. pylori infection and treated if present.

. . . . .

### PPI Safety

Many patients with dyspepsia will be treated with PPIs. While these medications are usually well tolerated, the long-term use of PPIs has come under scrutiny due to the association of PPI therapy with a number of serious complications, including cardiovascular events,​[[51]](#refitem-1212112-96085FFC)​[[52]](#refitem-1212113-96086182) Clostridioides difficile and other enteric bacterial infections,​[[53]](#refitem-1212115-960A1BB1)​[[54]](#refitem-1182114-CC8C3FE3) community-acquired pneumonia,​[[55]](#refitem-1182115-CC8C7D01)​[[56]](#Zirk-Sadowski2018) dementia,​[[57]](#refitem-1212111-96085E57) hypomagnesemia,​[[58]](#refitem-1182118-CC8CDF90) kidney disease,​[[59]](#refitem-1182119-CC8D010E)​[[60]](#refitem-1182120-CC8D638E) and osteoporosis-related fracture.​[[61]](#refitem-1212114-96086317)​[[62]](#Targownik2018) PPI use has also been associated with a higher rate of severe clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, though it is less clear whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition.​[[63]](#Li2020)​[[64]](#Kow2021)

Associations between PPI use and any of these outcomes do not necessarily infer causality. PPI use is more likely to be directly responsible for the increase in the risk of enteric infections, including C. difficile infection. For the other reported adverse events, there is little evidence to suggest that PPI use is directly causal; rather, chronic PPI use is probably a proxy for frailty and susceptibility to disease, which may explain why PPI users are more likely to develop these adverse conditions.​[[65]](#Moayyedi2019)

While there is no proven causal association, PPI use should be restricted to those patients who have strong indications for ongoing use, including persons with severe erosive esophagitis, ASA/NSAID users at high risk for complicated PUD, and those with Barrett esophagus.​[[62]](#Targownik2018) All other patients should be considered for PPI deprescribing.

The practice of deprescribing refers to an effort to either discontinue PPIs outright, decrease exposure to PPIs by stepping down to a lower dose or intermittent/on-demand treatment regimen, or substituting PPIs with a less costly and/or less potent form of gastric acid inhibition.​[[62]](#Targownik2018)​[[66]](#Farrell2017) The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and Choosing Wisely Canada recommend re-evaluating PPI therapy for GI symptoms on an annual basis through a trial discontinuation or dosage reduction.​[[67]](#refitem-1212116-960B07B5)​[[68]](#refitem-1212117-960B09A5) See Deprescribing for information and resources to support deprescribing PPIs in appropriate patients.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Dyspepsia may appear for the first time during pregnancy but usually resolves afterwards. Some patients with dyspepsia, including those of reproductive potential, may try to manage their symptoms with nonprescription antacids, barrier agents (e.g., alginates), **H2RAs** and PPIs. These medications are generally considered safe to use during pregnancy.​[[69]](#c0046n00184)​[[70]](#c0046n00275)​[[71]](#c0046n00276)​[[72]](#c0046n00271)​[[73]](#c0046n00272)

Limited data suggest that ingestion of esomeprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole produces low levels of these drugs in breast milk and would not be expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. No information is available on the use of rabeprazole, lansoprazole or dexlansoprazole during breastfeeding. Similarly, the available information indicates that ingestion of cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine and ranitidine while breastfeeding results in infant dosages much less than those given directly to neonates; these agents would not be expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants; however, because of cimetidine’s potential to cause hepatic enzyme inhibition, other drugs in this class might be preferred.

Pregnant patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia may be treated as outlined in the section [Initial Non-Endoscopic Management of Dyspepsia](#c0046n00231). If a diagnostic test for H. pylori (serology, endoscopy, UBT with the ​13C isotope) was done during pregnancy or breastfeeding, postpone treatment for the H. pylori infection until after pregnancy and breastfeeding. There is no need to test the infant for H. pylori if the breastfeeding parent is infected. It has been proposed that the ​14C (radioactive) and the ​13C (nonradioactive) UBTs are acceptable to use during pregnancy, since the radioactivity delivered to the fetus from the ​14C is low and is estimated to be less than the total amount of natural radioactivity the fetus is exposed to in 1 day.​[[74]](#c0046n00266)

Exposure to NSAIDs after 30 weeks’ gestation is associated with an increased risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age).​[[75]](#c0046n00270)​[[76]](#c0046n00269) If ASA, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors are absolutely indicated during pregnancy, gastroprotection with a PPI may be considered. The synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol is a potent uterine stimulant and must not be used during pregnancy.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
