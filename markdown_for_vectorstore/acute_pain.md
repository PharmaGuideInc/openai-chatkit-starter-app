### Introduction

Pain is one of the most common symptoms experienced by patients. Acute pain is temporary and may last for minutes or up to several weeks. It needs to be recognized, assessed for cause and treated appropriately as soon as possible. The absence of treatment can lead to physiological and psychological adverse effects. Treatment should be tailored to the level and type of pain. The absence of a diagnosis, including for patients with abdominal pain, should not delay measures to relieve pain.

### Goals of Therapy

- Recognize that the patient is experiencing pain
- Relieve the pain until the cause is treated
- Identify and treat the cause of pain

### Investigations

- Observe the patient for behavioural signs of pain, e.g., agitation, anxiety, crying, gritting of teeth, withdrawal from activities
- Solicit self-reports of the pain
- Inquire about the medical history and associated symptoms and perform a physical examination to determine the cause and severity of pain
- Inquire about medication self-treatment history and possible allergy or adverse reactions to analgesics
- When available, validate the medication history with a centralized computerized health record, especially when opioids are considered
- Use appropriate investigations to determine the cause of pain
- Use a pain scale to measure and assess pain in order to judge the severity of the pain and the efficacy of the interventions
- Frequently evaluate response to treatment

*Note:* The use of a pain scale can help reduce oligoanalgesia (undertreatment of pain).​[[1]](#c0011n00117) Record the results of this assessment as for a vital sign. The easy-to-use verbal numeric scale, also known as the numeric rating scale (NRS), asks the patient to grade pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) and is validated in adults and children ≥6 years of age.​[[2]](#c0011n00122) Other pain scales such as the standardized Color Analogue Scale or the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale can be used in children as young as 4–5 years or 3–6 years, respectively.​[[3]](#c0011n00123) The PAINAD tool was developed to assess pain in adults with cognitive impairment.​[[4]](#c0011n00184)

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0011n00001) illustrates the clinical management of acute pain.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Assess patients presenting with acute pain quickly, calmly and with empathy. Provide reassurance and encourage patients to verbalize their pain at all stages of treatment. Initiate immediate measures to decrease pain (e.g., immobilize a fracture, apply dressings to burns, employ cold or heat or other techniques such as relaxation, imagery and distraction) until pharmacologic treatment is started and takes effect. Do not wait until a full assessment is made to start pharmacologic treatment.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 1](#c0011n00019) provides a list of nonopioid and opioid medications for the treatment of acute pain.

### Oral Analgesics

As a first step for mild to moderate pain (NRS scores <7), initiate treatment with a nonopioid analgesic (i.e., acetaminophen and/or NSAID). If pain persists and is still moderate or worsening, consider adding an oral opioid to the “first-step” drug. For patients with severe acute pain (NRS scores ≥7), starting a parenteral medication is usually more appropriate (see [Figure 1](#c0011n00001)).

### Nonopioid Analgesics

Acetaminophen can be used for mild to moderate pain. Compared with full-dose NSAIDs, acetaminophen has fewer adverse effects and drug interactions but is less effective and has no anti-inflammatory action.​[[5]](#c0011n00181) Acetaminophen can be used with NSAIDs or oral opioids for additive analgesic effect.

NSAIDs are a heterogeneous group of medications with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Medications from all 5 classes of nonselective NSAIDs (i.e., salicylates, fenamates, propionic acid derivatives, oxicams, acetic acid derivatives) are effective for mild to moderate pain. Prescribing information for all classes of NSAIDs can be found in Osteoarthritis. Full single doses of most NSAIDs provide more effective analgesia than full doses of ASA or acetaminophen.​[[5]](#c0011n00181) Choosing an NSAID can be difficult; some patients respond well to a certain class but not to others and cost can be an important factor.

Adverse effects associated with single (or a few) doses of nonselective NSAIDs are limited and are qualitatively similar to those of ASA. Chronic use is associated with GI effects (ulceration, bleeding, perforation) and renal failure. Combining a PPI once daily or misoprostol 200 mcg QID PO with an NSAID effectively provides protection from GI toxicity,​[[6]](#c0011n00185) and should be considered in patients with risk factors for peptic ulcer disease (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease). Some combinations are commercially available in Canada (e.g., naproxen/esomeprazole, diclofenac/misoprostol). Unlike other NSAIDs, ASA irreversibly inhibits platelet function for the lifetime of the platelet (8–10 days) even after a single therapeutic dose. In contrast, platelet function returns to normal when other NSAIDs have been eliminated from the body (within approximately 24 hours for most NSAIDs). NSAIDs can precipitate asthma in ASA-sensitive patients. All NSAIDs cause a slight increase in the risk of myocardial infarction.​[[7]](#c0011n98765) Higher doses are associated with a higher risk. Avoid NSAIDs in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, heart failure or ischemic heart disease.

COX-2 selective NSAIDs such as celecoxib may cause less severe GI toxicity than nonselective NSAIDs, but are more expensive and have a poorly defined role and an unstudied adverse effect profile in the treatment of acute pain.

ASA can be given with opioids for additive analgesic effect. Avoid using ASA in children less than 18 years of age if they have a fever or viral illness such as flu or chickenpox or any unidentified infection because of a possible increased risk of Reye syndrome—a rare but serious condition that causes brain and liver damage. ASA can also precipitate asthma in ASA-sensitive patients.

Ibuprofen 200 mg provides analgesia equivalent to ASA 650 mg or acetaminophen 650 mg; a dose of 400 mg is superior and longer acting, and provides analgesia comparable to the combination of acetaminophen/codeine.​[[5]](#c0011n00181) In children, a 10 mg/kg dose of ibuprofen is as safe as a 15 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen, although GI bleeding has been reported with ibuprofen.​[[8]](#c0011n00160) The role of ibuprofen in combination with acetaminophen or opioids in the management of acute pain from musculoskeletal injury needs to be clarified.​[[9]](#c0011n98764)​[[10]](#c0011n98763)

Naproxen has a longer duration of action than ASA​[[5]](#c0011n00181) and ibuprofen. Compared with ASA 650 mg, naproxen 250 mg is equally effective and naproxen 500 mg is superior.​[[11]](#c0011n00156)

### Opioids

Oral opioids can be used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. The parenteral route may be preferred for severe pain due to a faster onset of action. Opioids are included in the list of medications described as “high-alert” by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Canada—if not used appropriately, they have a high risk of causing harm to the patient.​[[12]](#c0011n00186) Adverse effects include constipation, nausea, sedation, respiratory depression and (if used for several weeks) tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and opioid-use disorder. However, potential long-term consequences in a minority of patients should not deter the clinician from appropriately treating acute pain with a few doses of opioids when required by the severity of pain. Skin reactions (i.e., hives) and itching are common and are usually due to a histamine release, not allergy; symptoms are often relieved with administration of an antihistamine or a switch to a different opioid. Use the lowest recommended dose when treating opioid-naïve, frail or elderly patients. Use caution when switching among opioids and consider the equipotent doses (see Opioids (CPhA Monograph)) of each drug, particularly when substituting to highly potent hydromorphone. Due to incomplete cross-tolerance, it may be necessary to halve the equipotent dose when initiating an opioid switch and titrate the dose carefully (see the [National Pain Centre's Switching Opioids Form](http://nationalpaincentre.mcmaster.ca/opioidmanager/documents/opioid_manager_switching_opioids.pdf)).

Due to its adverse effect profile, meperidine (pethidine) should not be used for pain that is expected to last for more than 3 hours (see [Parenteral Analgesics](#c0011n00013)).

Codeine is available as single-entity formulations and in combination with acetaminophen or ASA 325 mg. Prescription and nonprescription products containing codeine are no longer recommended for children under 12 years of age,​[[13]](#c0011n00182) or in children under 18 years of age to treat pain after surgery to remove tonsils or adenoids.​[[14]](#HealthCanada.NewSafetyMeasuresForPr-3C4ADC15) Very rare cases of serious side effects and death in children have been attributed to codeine when given directly or ingested by infants via breast milk. Individuals who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers (1–2% of patients)​[[15]](#c0011n04231) convert codeine to morphine quickly, leading to increased risk of adverse effects and potential overdose. Conversely, poor metabolizers (5–10% of patients)​[[15]](#c0011n04231) or those who take drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 will have inadequate analgesic effect with codeine.​[[16]](#c0011n00028) For these same reasons, codeine as a single agent is not a reliable treatment for acute pain in adults and its use is discouraged as better options exist (e.g., morphine).

Oral morphine is a better alternative for acute pain; an equipotent dose will be at least as effective as codeine, with a more predictable effect and adverse effect profile. Morphine is available in several immediate-release dosage forms and sustained-release preparations, but the longer-acting formulations should rarely be used to treat acute pain. Because morphine's adverse effects are predictable, the dose can be titrated to achieve a pain-free status.

Hydromorphone is an alternative to morphine for acute pain. Due to its higher potency, lower doses are needed. It is available as oral liquid or tablets as well as parenteral formulations. Immediate-release products such as liquid, tablets and IV solutions are preferable to controlled-release products in the management of acute pain.

Oxycodone is available in single-entity immediate-release or controlled-release formulations and in combination with acetaminophen. Immediate-release formulations with or without acetaminophen are an effective alternative for acute pain management; use with caution since oxycodone has significant abuse potential.

Tramadol is a unique analgesic. It is structurally related to morphine and codeine and acts through opioid and nonopioid mechanisms, such as inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Although it appears to have less abuse potential and, in most patients, minimal effect on respiratory function, tramadol causes more nausea compared with other opioids and may not be as effective unless combined with another analgesic such as acetaminophen.​[[17]](#c0011n00119)​[[18]](#c0011n00120) It is converted to an active metabolite by CYP2D6, so patients that are ultra-rapid metabolizers are at risk of respiratory depression. Tramadol should not be used as a first-line analgesic for acute pain.​[[18]](#c0011n00120)​[[19]](#c0011n00169)​[[20]](#c0011n00170)

### Parenteral Analgesics

IV administration is less painful and has a more rapid and predictable onset of action compared with the SC and IM routes. The intranasal route can be used with fentanyl.​[[21]](#c0011n00171)

### NSAIDs

Ketorolac is an NSAID that can be given IM or IV for treatment of moderate to severe pain. A dose of 30 mg is comparable to approximately 12 mg of morphine,​[[5]](#c0011n00181) although, more recently, an IV dose of only 10 mg of ketorolac was demonstrated to have the same analgesic efficacy as doses of 15 and 30 mg to treat moderate to severe pain.​[[22]](#c0011n98762) Ketorolac has the same adverse effect profile as other oral nonselective NSAIDs. The pharmacologic effect cannot be titrated but the drug can be used when opioids are contraindicated. Limit its use to 5 days' duration to minimize adverse effects. Ketorolac is effective for treatment of pain associated with renal colic.

Ibuprofen, at a dose of 400 mg or 800 mg administered as an IV infusion every 6 hours, significantly decreased pain at rest and with movement when used adjunctively with IV opioids for short-term management of postoperative pain. The 800 mg dose, but not the 400 mg dose, significantly reduced opioid requirements during the first 24 hours after surgery.​[[23]](#c0011n00162)

### Opioids

In case opioid overdosage occurs, keep naloxone (see Naloxone (CPhA Monograph)) on hand when administering opioids parenterally. Respiratory depression rarely occurs as long as the opioid is titrated to the level of pain.

Morphine is the gold standard to which other opioids are compared. Its advantages (i.e., over meperidine) include a longer duration of action and metabolism that is not affected by liver disease. It can be administered as continuous infusion or as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), a pump programmed to deliver a preset amount of drug by continuous infusion or repeated boluses, as well as smaller bolus doses for breakthrough pain.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with a duration of action of only 30–60 minutes, making it an ideal analgesic for brief procedures. It can be administered by infusion, but this offers no advantage over morphine in terms of efficacy, and is much more costly. Fentanyl has almost no hemodynamic effects and does not induce histamine release, unlike morphine and meperidine. Rapid IV administration can lead to chest wall rigidity that could interfere with ventilation. A single dose of intranasal fentanyl can be used to rapidly treat acute pain when there is no IV access (such as on arrival at the emergency department).​[[21]](#c0011n00171) This requires an atomizer device as well as established policy and procedures for administration. The intranasal dose should be followed by administration of an IV opioid when required.

Meperidine is not considered a first-line option in the treatment of acute pain and should not be given for pain that is expected to last more than 3 hours, where morphine is a better choice. Limit its use to short-term (24–48 hours) due to the accumulation of normeperidine, a neurotoxic metabolite that can cause seizures in some patients and CNS effects such as tremors, hyperreflexia and hallucinations. Avoid using meperidine in patients with renal failure or liver disease and in those who have received MAOIs in the past 14 days. In some hospitals, meperidine has been removed from the formulary because of these concerns and the fact that better options exist, e.g., morphine.

### Other

Ketamine administered IV at subdissociative doses (0.1–0.5 mg/kg) as an adjunct to opioids provides good analgesia with minimal or no impact on the cardiorespiratory function of patients.​[[24]](#c0011n00568) In that situation, it can confer opioid-sparing effect. It can also be administered alone with some efficacy but the data supporting this are limited.​[[25]](#c0011n00569)

### Topical and Local Anesthesia

Topical NSAIDs can be used to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions.​[[26]](#c0011n00144) They provide local pain relief with fewer systemic effects compared with oral NSAIDs, although their comparative efficacy is unknown. See Osteoarthritis for information on topical NSAIDs available.

For small facial lacerations, a mixture of tetracaine 0.5–1%, epinephrine (adrenaline) 0.25–0.5% and cocaine 1–4% (**TAC**) can be applied topically (volume 3 mL; maximum topical cocaine dose 6 mg/kg). The restricted status of cocaine limits its usefulness. A mixture of lidocaine 0.4%, epinephrine 0.1% and tetracaine 0.05% (**LET**), in a dose of 2 mL topically, is as effective as TAC.

Topical anesthetics such as eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA), amethocaine (tetracaine; Ametop) or **liposomal lidocaine** (Maxilene) can be used to reduce pain associated with minor procedures such as needle insertion on intact skin.

EMLA, containing prilocaine and lidocaine, causes vasoconstriction, potentially making cannulation difficult. To be effective, a large amount should be applied and covered with an occlusive dressing for at least 45–60 minutes. Amethocaine is superior to EMLA in preventing pain associated with needle insertion in children.​[[27]](#c0011n00121) It requires a shorter application time (30 minutes) than EMLA (45–60 minutes). Amethocaine causes vasodilation and may induce hypersensitivity with repeated use. Liposomal lidocaine is as effective as EMLA in decreasing pain associated with venipuncture or IV cannulation. It has minimal vasoactive properties and requires an application time of 30 minutes. An occlusive dressing is not required, but is recommended in young children.

Infiltrative techniques using lidocaine are frequently used for minor procedures. A dose of 3–5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) can be used for direct infiltration or regional nerve block. Coadministration of epinephrine allows an increase of lidocaine dose to 5–7 mg/kg, unless epinephrine is contraindicated (e.g., if tissue vascularity is poor or if distal vasculature is involved). If allergy to amide-type local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, bupivacaine) is suspected, an ester (e.g., procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) can be used because of the absence of cross-reactivity.

### Inhalation Pain Management

Inhaled nitrous oxide (N20) 30–50% can be used as an analgesic for short procedural sedation.​[[28]](#c0011n00192) Advantages include rapid onset and short duration of action. Contraindications include altered level of consciousness, severe maxillofacial injuries, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, shock, decompression sickness, bowel obstruction and major chest injury. Nitrous oxide can also induce lightheadedness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and excitement.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Acute pain is a common occurrence during pregnancy and in breastfeeding mothers. These conditions need not preclude the use of analgesics. However, prescribing the safest alternative for the fetus or newborn is paramount.

### Pregnancy

For mild pain, the drug of choice is usually acetaminophen. During pregnancy, the use of NSAIDs should be restricted to the 1​st or 2​nd trimester; even short-term NSAID use after 32 weeks is associated with a significant increase in the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, and is not recommended.​[[29]](#c0011n00145) On October 30, 2020, Health Canada started investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant women 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[[30]](#HCNSAIDsPregnancy1) This investigation is in response to a U.S. FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[[31]](#FDANSAIDs20201) While short-term use may not pose a significant increased risk, use beyond 48 h may require ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected.

For more severe pain, opioids can be used at all stages of pregnancy. If opioids are used during the late stage of labour, the newborn should be monitored for signs of respiratory depression. When opioids are used at high doses or more than sporadically in late pregnancy, monitor the newborn for signs of withdrawal. Neonatal withdrawal can occur when therapeutic doses of opioids are used in late pregnancy.​[[32]](#c0011n00146)

### Breastfeeding

For mild pain, the drug of choice is acetaminophen. NSAIDs can be used safely during breastfeeding.

For most immediate-release opioid analgesics, the amount of drug transferred into breast milk is small and thus can be safe if limited to therapeutic doses and relatively short-term use (2–3 days). Breastfeeding mothers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of opioid toxicity for themselves (constipation, oversedation) and their babies (drowsiness or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, decreased muscular tone). Mothers should stop breastfeeding if they develop signs of toxicity.​[[33]](#Anderson2016) ​[[34]](#Ito2018)

Health Canada and the US FDA advise against the use of codeine during breastfeeding unless the benefits outweigh the risks.​[[35]](#HCcodeine2008)​[[36]](#FDAcodeine2018) Controversy exists in the interpretation of the case report that was one of the bases of the recommendation.​[[37]](#Zipursky2020)​[[38]](#Pimlott2020) Until the controversy is resolved, it may be reasonable to limit use of codeine in breastfeeding mothers.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Choose the medication and route of administration according to severity of pain and desired onset and duration of action.
- Using a pain scale, reassess the need for analgesics frequently.
- Monitor the patient's level of consciousness (opioids) and the presence of adverse effects after administering an analgesic.
- Consider adding sedatives to analgesics, particularly for painful procedures. However, sedative use should not replace analgesics.
- Choose the most appropriate analgesic, considering hepatic and renal function and concurrent medication.
- Allow an adequate amount of time (according to the analgesic's onset of action) before performing a painful procedure or assessing whether an analgesic is effective.
- Opioid analgesics can be safely given before full assessment and diagnosis in acute abdominal pain, without increasing the risk of errors in diagnosis or treatment.​[[39]](#c0011n00154)​[[40]](#c0011n00183)
- Consult specialized acute pain services as needed.
