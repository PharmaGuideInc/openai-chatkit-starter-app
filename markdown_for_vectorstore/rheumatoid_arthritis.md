*CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.*

### Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease manifesting primarily as a symmetric and erosive polyarthritis. It can cause pain, stiffness and fatigue as well as joint destruction resulting in disability and premature mortality, although with advances in treatment, this mortality gap has narrowed.​[[1]](#29796636) RA can also be associated with systemic manifestations involving most internal organs. The incidence of RA is 0.05% per year and prevalence is 1% of the adult population. Onset can occur at any age, including childhood, but most frequently starts between the ages of 50 and 60. Rheumatoid arthritis affects women 3 times more frequently than men.

Erosions will be seen on radiographs at the first visit in 20% of patients and will be present in up to 70% of patients at 1 year if left untreated. Patients with RA have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, osteoporosis, lymphoproliferative disease and depression.​[[2]](#c0060n00332)​[[3]](#RoubilleC2015JRheumato)​[[4]](#DougadosM2014AnnRheumDis) Rheumatologists recommend an early approach to management, which includes starting treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made.​[[5]](#c0060n00302)

### Goals of Therapy

- Fully control signs and symptoms of the disease, including pain, stiffness and fatigue
- Halt radiographic progression and joint damage
- Maintain physical function and work capacity and maximize quality of life
- Obtain rapid clinical improvement with a goal of 50% improvement within 3 months and ideally clinical remission. If remission is not possible, at a minimum the target is low disease activity within 6 months​[[5]](#c0060n00302)​[[6]](#c0060n00304)​[[7]](#EULAR2019)

Remission can be defined using multiple composite disease activity measures. In general, remission means the absence of disease activity as assessed by a clinician (swollen and tender joints) and the patient (global assessment of disease activity) as well as laboratory results (CRP and/or ESR). A commonly used tool for assessing disease activity is the [DAS28](http://www.rheumdas.com/).​[[8]](#England2019) When using DAS28, remission is defined as a score of <2.6 and low disease activity as a score of <3.2. These scores may be used to guide therapy choices and adjustments.

### Investigations

The diagnosis of RA should be considered in patients with joint swelling or inflammatory joint pain, although the differential diagnosis of joint swelling is broad.​[[9]](#c0060n00366) To make a diagnosis of RA, objective joint swelling (by clinical exam or imaging) must be present. Patients with RA typically have multiple swollen joints in a symmetric distribution with involvement of the hands and feet. Patients also report morning stiffness greater than 30 minutes. Radiographic evidence of joint erosions typical of RA can be sufficient for confirming the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of RA may be difficult early in the disease, as typical features may be absent and radiographs of the hands and feet are usually normal. To assist in prompt diagnosis, classification criteria have been developed​[[10]](#c0060n00303)​[[11]](#c0060n00365) (see [Table 1](#c0060n00424)). Anyone suspected of having RA should be referred urgently to a rheumatologist for evaluation, ideally within 6 weeks of the onset of symptoms.​[[12]](#Combe2017) For more information on evaluation of an RA patient, see [Table 2](#c0060n00029).

**Table 1:** Classification Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis

| Classification Criteria | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Add scores from categories A–D; a score of ≥6/10 is needed for a definite diagnosis of RA |
| A. Joint involvement ​ [a] |  |
|  | 1 large joint​ [b] | 0 |
|  | 2–10 large joints | 1 |
|  | 1–3 small joints​ [c] | 2 |
|  | 4–10 small joints | 3 |
|  | >10 joints (at least 1 small joint) | 5 |
| B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)​ [d] |  |
|  | Negative RF and negative anti-CCP | 0 |
|  | Low-positive RF or low-positive anti-CCP | 2 |
|  | High-positive RF or high-positive anti-CCP | 3 |
| C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification) |  |
|  | Normal CRP and normal ESR | 0 |
|  | Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR | 1 |
| D. Duration of symptoms |  |
|  | <6 wk | 0 |
|  | ≥6 wk | 1 |

[a] Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis.

[b] “Large joints” refer to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees and ankles.

[c] “Small joints” refer to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints and wrists.

[d] Negative refers to international unit values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to unit values that are higher than the ULN but ≤3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to unit values that are >3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is available only as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low-positive for RF.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Rheumatoid arthritis is best treated using a multidisciplinary team approach that provides patient education, emotional and psychological support, and physical rehabilitation. Patients should be advised regarding energy conservation, appropriate levels of activity and work roles, types of exercise and pain modulation with application of heat and cold,​[[13]](#c0060n00036) adjustments to activities of daily living, and maintenance of joint range of motion and muscle strength. Patients benefit from physical activity, and it should be a part of their treatment regimen. Physical activity that includes the 4 domains (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, flexibility and neuromotor performance) are applicable (feasible and safe) to people with RA.​[[14]](#Rausch2018) Patients should be periodically evaluated for splints, foot orthoses and proper footwear; some patients may require surgical interventions for damaged joints. Dietary omega-3 PUFA may have a small, beneficial effect on disease activity in RA.​[[15]](#Skoczynka2018) Other dietary interventions may also have beneficial effect, but the evidence is still limited. There is insufficient evidence to support complementary or alternative therapies for the treatment of RA.​[[16]](#c0060n00382) There is currently no evidence to support use of cannabis in the management of RA.​[[17]](#Fitzcharles2019)

### Pharmacologic Choices

There are many medications available for the treatment of RA, which include conventional synthetic **disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs** (csDMARDs, also known as traditional DMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Biologic DMARDs can further be divided into bio-originator DMARDs (boDMARDs) and biosimilar DMARDS (bsDMARDs), to reflect whether they were made by the first or subsequent manufacturers.

The diagnosis of RA should be confirmed by a rheumatologist who will start the patient on csDMARD therapy (see [Figure 1](#c0060n00025), [Table 5](#c0060n00017)). **Corticosteroids** (IM or PO) are often used early in the management of RA as bridging therapy. **NSAIDs** may also be used for symptom control, but should be used cautiously, especially in patients with risk factors (e.g., renal impairment, hypertension, elderly, history of peptic ulcer disease). Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac may also provide relief and have a better safety profile. Before selecting an initial therapy, the severity of illness, prognostic factors (see [Table 3](#c0060n99003)), extra-articular features, comorbid conditions, potential adverse events, dosing intervals, routes of administration, monitoring requirements, patient preferences and costs all require consideration. Improvement with csDMARDs may be seen in 6–8 weeks of therapy initiation and reach maximum effect in 3–6 months.

Patients should be seen frequently, at least every 3 months, while their disease is active.​[[5]](#c0060n00302)​[[6]](#c0060n00304) Those with well-controlled disease or in remission can be followed at longer intervals (every 6–12 months). Therapy should be frequently adjusted until a patient reaches a target (remission or at least low disease activity), ideally by 3–6 months.​[[5]](#c0060n00302)​[[6]](#c0060n00304) Major changes to therapy, such as adding or switching agents, may be considered if there is ongoing disease activity after 3 months of maximal therapy. Minor adjustments, including the judicious use of oral, IM or intra-articular corticosteroids, may occur more frequently. Therapy adjustments may also be required if the patient experiences repetitive flares or progressive joint damage or develops evidence of drug toxicity.

| Non-modifiable Prognostic Factors | Modifiable Prognostic Factors |
| Moderate to high disease activity according to composite measures (e.g., DAS28) or individual measures (e.g., swollen joint count, high acute phase reactants) Presence of RF and/or Anti-CCP,​ [a] especially at high levels Presence of erosions on radiograph at baseline Increased MBDA Failure of 2 or more csDMARDs High degree of physical disability at onset | Smoking Sedentary lifestyle Delay in treatment initiation |

### Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

### Monotherapy

Methotrexate is the “gold standard” csDMARD and is an anchor drug in the treatment of RA.​[[5]](#c0060n00302)​[[20]](#c0060n00468) It is usually the drug of choice or part of the initial treatment strategy for those who do not have a contraindication. An adequate trial of methotrexate consists of a weekly maximum dose of 25 mg (orally or subcutaneously) for at least 3 months. While many brands do not list subcutaneous administration as an approved route, it is easier to administer (in upper thigh or abdomen by the patients themselves), less painful, safer and more effective than IM and provides more consistent blood levels than oral.​[[21]](#Bianchi2016)​[[22]](#Brooks1990) Thus, IM methotrexate is rarely used. Oral doses may be split during the same 24-hour period to improve absorption, as doses greater than 15 mg are not well absorbed. Discontinuation rates and side effects of methotrexate (GI adverse effects, apthous ulcers, liver dysfunction) can be reduced by concurrent use of folic acid (at least 5 mg/wk), which is typically given the day after methotrexate administration, but may be administered daily. The evidence does not suggest that same-day use of folic acid with methotrexate affects methotrexate efficacy.​[[23]](#Shea2014) Folinic acid (5 mg/wk 8–12 h after methotrexate dose) is sometimes used as an alternative to folic acid and may be especially useful in patients who experience adverse effects of methotrexate despite supplementation with folic acid.​[[23]](#Shea2014)​[[24]](#c0060n00308)​[[25]](#c0060n00480)

Monotherapy with sulfasalazine may be considered in patients with a contraindication to methotrexate. It may also be considered for some patients with early, very mild disease and absence of poor prognostic factors (see [Table 3](#c0060n99003)); however, the evidence of effectiveness of monotherapy with sulfasalazine is limited compared to methotrexate. Monotherapy with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is used sometimes for very mild disease; however, it has less impact on joint damage compared with other csDMARDs.​[[7]](#EULAR2019) Long-term use is associated with a risk of retinal toxicity. Patients taking hydroxychloroquine require regular eye exams (6–12 months). Both drugs are more commonly used in combination with methotrexate than as monotherapy.

Leflunomide is another csDMARD that can be added to or used instead of methotrexate. The loading dose of leflunomide often causes significant diarrhea and is no longer recommended. Leflunomide may be associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events when compared to methotrexate. Cases of severe liver injury (49 cases, including 14 fatalities) were reported with leflunomide use.​[[26]](#c0060n00309) Patients who have these significant side effects to leflunomide may require a “washout” with cholestyramine or activated charcoal in order to eliminate the drug.

### Combination Therapy

Combinations of DMARDs are frequently utilized for the treatment of RA, either as initial treatment or as add-on treatment in patients who have an inadequate response to csDMARD (typically methotrexate) monotherapy. It is not unusual for patients to be on 4 or more agents at any given time in order to control the disease.

In general, it is preferable to continue methotrexate, even if the patient is an incomplete responder (i.e., does not achieve remission or low-disease activity). The treatment combination with the best evidence to support its use is **methotrexate**, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine (“triple therapy”). In patients who have an inadequate response to methotrexate, triple therapy is superior in efficacy to methotrexate alone as initial therapy and similar to combination therapy with methotrexate and a biologic.​[[27]](#HazelwoodCochrane2016)​[[28]](#ScotDLBMJ2015) Triple therapy is safe to use, although it may have a higher rate of GI intolerance, which usually improves over time.

There is also evidence of efficacy using combination therapy with methotrexate and leflunomide,​[[29]](#c0060n00044) although they should be used with caution, as the combination is associated with higher toxicity (GI and liver) and has not been shown to be superior to other DMARD combinations. When methotrexate and leflunomide are used in combination, the dose of 1 or both is usually reduced, and ongoing monitoring is required.​[[5]](#c0060n00302)

Oral and **parenteral gold**, minocycline, **D-**penicillamine, azathioprine and cyclosporine were once used, but are not part of any guideline-recommended therapy.

### Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

Biologic DMARDs (see [Table 6](#c0060n00034)) target key mediators of inflammatory synovitis and bone and cartilage destruction, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and others. These agents improve the signs and symptoms of active RA and reduce the radiologic progression of the disease.​[[30]](#c0060n00310) In patients with a partial response to biologic therapy, maximizing the use of methotrexate or adding other csDMARDs may provide additional benefits. Among the bDMARDs, TNF inhibitors are used more commonly as first-line therapy, which may be due to the availability of long-term safety data and effectiveness in multiple types of inflammatory arthritis, but most other biologic agents are also approved for first-line use.

### Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors

TNF-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) were the first biologics introduced for the treatment of RA and include adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab. Among the TNFi, there is comparable efficacy leading to rapid improvement in signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory parameters of inflammation, usually within 8–12 weeks.​[[31]](#c0060n00388) All TNFi agents are most effective when used with methotrexate or another csDMARD.​[[32]](#c0060n00311)

The currently available 5 TNFi differ in their structure, which can impact selection of an agent for any given patient. **Infliximab** is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, and can be administered only intravenously. Its main advantage is its ability to adjust both dose and interval for patient response over time. **Adalimumab** (ADA), **certolizumab** (CTZ), **etanercept** (ETN) and **golimumab** (GOL) are usually given subcutaneously by self injection, although GOL can also be administered IV. ADA/CTZ/GOL are fully humanized and differ most in their dosing intervals (from weekly to Q4 wk). Certolizumab is unique in that the antibody fragment is pegylated, which makes the molecule too large to pass into the placenta or breast milk. ETN differs in that it is not an antibody, but a receptor antagonist, which is a unique mechanism of action among the biologics.

Patients with inadequate or loss of response to TNFi therapy may be switched to a biologic with a different mechanism of action or to another TNFi. There is low-quality evidence that switching to a biologic with a different mechanism of action is preferred over a second TNFi in patients with inadequate response to the first TNFi.​[[33]](#c0060n94321)​[[34]](#Gottenberg2016JAMA) Patients with inadequate response to the second TNFi should be switched to a biologic with a different mechanism of action.​[[33]](#c0060n94321)

### Interleukin Inhibitors

Tocilizumab and sarilumab are interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors indicated for patients with moderate to severe disease who have an inadequate response to csDMARDs.​[[35]](#c0060n00322)​[[36]](#c0060n00323)​[[37]](#c0060n00324)​[[38]](#Genovese2015) They are also effective as monotherapy (without methotrexate or other DMARDs), though combination therapy with MTX is generally preferred.​[[39]](#c0060n00390)​[[40]](#Burmester2017) IL-6 inhibitors have some unique potential adverse effects compared to other biologics. Drug-induced liver injury, neutropenia and increased risk of bowel perforation are possible complications of IL-6 therapy.​[[41]](#HCwarning2019)​[[42]](#Sarilumab2017)

Anakinra blocks the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. Although it is effective in reducing radiographic damage, it is felt to be less effective than other biologic therapies and is therefore no longer commonly used.​[[43]](#c0060n00315) It is associated with an up to 70% chance of developing injection-site reactions, which may resolve in approximately 1 month but it appears to be associated with fewer significant infections compared to TNFi therapy.

### Other Biologics

Abatacept is a fusion protein that includes a natural inhibitor of T-cell co-stimulation that binds to a receptor on T cells and blocks their interaction with other antigen-presenting cells, thereby leading to a decreased immune response. It is effective in patients who have had an inadequate response to 1 or more csDMARDs​[[44]](#c0060n00316)​[[45]](#c0060n00317)​[[46]](#c0060n00318) and/or to TNFi therapy.​[[47]](#c0060n00319) A direct comparison between abatacept and adalimumab found comparable efficacy.​[[48]](#c0060n00389)

Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that effectively removes memory B cells from the circulation while leaving plasma B cells intact. It is most effective when used with methotrexate in RF and/or anti-CCP positive patients who have had an inadequate response to 1 or more csDMARDs​[[49]](#c0060n00320) and/or TNFi.​[[50]](#c0060n00321) Some seronegative (i.e., RF and anti-CCP negative) patients may also respond.​[[51]](#Isaacs2013) The activity of rituximab is not related to the half-life but rather to the depletion of B cells, which may be patient-specific. A dose is given when symptoms start to flare, usually every 6–12 months.

### Biosimilars

Biosimilars (previously called *subsequent entry biologics*) are biologic drugs that are made by a different manufacturer than that of the reference (innovator) biologic. Unlike generic drugs, biosimilars are not identical to the reference biologic drug and are therefore not necessarily interchangeable. A biological drug is a large protein molecule that is produced through recombinant DNA technology. The manufacturing process is proprietary and unique; it is impossible to exactly replicate the original molecule and therefore biosimilars should not be considered generic medicines. Biosimilars have a separate approval process through Health Canada that requires clinical trials to demonstrate their benefit and safety prior to being approved for a specific indication.​[[52]](#HCSEBBIOSMILARS)

### Targeted Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

Tofacitinib, baricitinib and upadacitinib are oral, synthetically produced DMARDs (see [Table 7](#c0060n10474)). Unlike csDMARDs, tsDMARDs target a specific intracellular pathway of the immune cell; they act by inhibiting Janus kinases (JAKs) and therefore blocking signalling through several cytokines in the inflammatory pathway. They are indicated by Health Canada for the treatment of RA as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe disease who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. Given the lack of long-term safety data and clinical experience with JAK inhibitors, it is reasonable to consider them after bDMARD treatment has failed. While more studies are being done in biologic-naïve patients, there is evidence that these agents are effective following bDMARDs.​[[7]](#EULAR2019)​[[53]](#c0060n00472)

### Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Biologic DMARDs

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease with no cure. As such, patients with RA typically require life-long treatment. In general, treatment tapering should be considered only in patients who have achieved remission. In those who have been difficult to get to target, or with severe disease, this should be done with caution. The 2016 American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines found very low- to moderate-quality evidence to support treatment tapering in patients in remission, based on a systematic review of randomized trials.​[[6]](#c0060n00304) Clinical trials have found that patients who reduce treatment have a higher rate of disease flare, but that a significant proportion of patients can successfully reduce treatment.​[[54]](#Kuijper2015JRheuma) In patients who do flare, most (but not all) can regain control of their disease by restarting the medication that was reduced or stopped.​[[55]](#Schett2016AnnRheumDis2016) If dose reduction or treatment tapering is attempted, it should be done cautiously with shared decision-making between the patient and rheumatologist.

### Safety of Biologic and Targeted Synthetic DMARDs

### Infections

Biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs are associated with a small, increased risk of serious infections including herpes zoster and opportunistic infections.​[[56]](#c0060n00384)​[[57]](#c0060n00385) In the presence of serious infection (especially if requiring IV antibiotics and/or hospitalization), biologics should not be initiated and should be discontinued in patients who are already receiving them.​[[58]](#Holroyd2019) They can be resumed once the infection has resolved.

The risk of serious infections differ among different bDMARDs and tsDMARDs. Old age, presence of comorbidities (e.g., lung disease), higher DAS28 score, higher physical disability, higher patient global assessment scores, and higher cumulative corticosteroid exposure are found to be predictors of serious infections.​[[59]](#Ozen2019)​[[60]](#Rutherford2018)​[[61]](#Dartel2013)

The risk of tuberculosis (TB) is increased in patients on TNFi therapy and JAK inhibitors, but is less clear with other bDMARDs.​[[32]](#c0060n00311) Prior to starting any therapy with bDMARD or tsDMARD, patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis by assessment of epidemiologic risk factors, a chest x-ray and a Mantoux skin test. In patients who screen positive, a QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) test may be done to further clarify TB reactivation risk​[[58]](#Holroyd2019) (see Tuberculosis). In patients who screen positive, exclude active TB and offer prophylactic therapy with isoniazid. Consider consultation with an infectious disease specialist if there is a concern about latent exposure to TB.

All patients, especially those on rituximab, should be screened for Hepatitis B infection, as there is a risk of reactivation.​[[62]](#Terrault2018) Prophylactic antiviral therapy may be required during treatment and up to 12 months following the last dose of rituximab.​[[62]](#Terrault2018) Patients should also be screened for Hepatitis C infection prior to initiating therapy with a bDMARD or a tsDMARD​[[58]](#Holroyd2019) (see Viral Hepatitis, Chronic).

Patients on any of the DMARD therapies do not require routine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) pneumonia or other common opportunistic infections unless there are other risk factors (e.g., high-dose corticosteroids) that would impact their risk.​[[63]](#Grubbs2014)​[[64]](#Kourbeti2014)

### Vaccinations

Although the humoral response to inactivated vaccines may be blunted due to DMARD therapy, there is no convincing evidence that vaccine effectiveness is reduced.​[[65]](#c0060n00387)​[[66]](#c0060n00450) Ideally, vaccinations should be up to date prior to initiating therapy, particularly in the case of live vaccines. Live vaccines are not recommended in patients taking bDMARD or tsDMARD therapy due to the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strain.​[[65]](#c0060n00387) The specific population section of the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-8-immunization-immunocompromised-persons.html#a27), as well as vaccine-specific chapters, offer detailed information on the use of all vaccines and should be reviewed for the most up-to-date information, including use of bDMARD or tsDMARD agents and other immunosuppressants with live vaccines. If the patient has already commenced therapy, most inactive vaccines are recommended, if indicated, e.g., influenza, pneumococcal.​[[65]](#c0060n00387)​[[66]](#c0060n00450) An inactive, recombinant version of the herpes zoster vaccine is currently available. While it has not been evaluated in patients taking DMARDs, it has been safely used in patients in more severe immunocompromised states (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, HIV) and is therefore recommended over the live vaccine in patients with RA.​[[67]](#refitem-1242161-87939627)  For a summary of recommendations for vaccination in patients with RA who have already commenced therapy, see [Table 4](#Recommendations).

**Table 4:** Recommendations for Vaccination in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis​[[33]](#c0060n94321)[[68]](#CanadianImmunizationGuide)

Double the usual dose and use 3- or 4-dose schedule.

[c] Varicella vaccine may be considered in patients taking methotrexate ≤0.4 mg/kg/wk.

[d] B-cell depleting biologics such as rituximab may require specific timing recommendations regarding vaccine administration.

### Interactions

Drug interactions with low-dose methotrexate can be difficult to assess and may be confusing to patients, as current resources for drug interactions do not differentiate between low- and high-dose therapy (i.e., dose used for inflammatory arthritis and dose used for cancer treatment). Interactions with commonly used agents such as NSAIDs, PPIs and low-dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (e.g., 3 times weekly for PJP) are not considered to have clinical relevance.​[[69]](#refitem-1242196-D7609CE8)​[[70]](#refitem-1242197-DD0E6A56)​[[71]](#refitem-12421100-8269938C)

bDMARDs generally have few drug interactions; however, use of 2 biologic agents or a biologic and a JAK inhibitor is not well studied, nor recommended due to increased infection risk.​[[72]](#c0060n00058)​[[73]](#c0060n00473) IL-6 inhibitors decrease the number of CYP enzymes and can therefore cause significant interactions with the drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system. Dosage adjustment may therefore be required.​[[74]](#Kim2012)​[[75]](#Schmitt2011) JAK inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP450 system, and caution is advised when concurrent therapy with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is used.

### Surgery

Elective surgical procedures in RA patients require careful consideration and planning, as patients are at an elevated risk of complications including infections and poor wound healing.​[[58]](#Holroyd2019) Biologic agents should be discontinued temporarily prior to surgery. The timing of withdrawal and reinstitution of therapy should be decided on an individual basis in discussion with the rheumatologist. If withheld, surgery should take place at the end of the dosing cycle of the bDMARD and restarted once the wound shows evidence of healing (usually 14 days).​[[58]](#Holroyd2019) Consider withholding tofacitinib or baricitinib therapy for at least 7 days prior to surgery; patients taking methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or low-dose corticosteroids can continue treatment at the current dose.​[[76]](#refitem-1202161-F31EEA20)

### Malignancy

Long-term safety with respect to lymphoproliferative and other malignancies continues to be investigated.​[[77]](#c0060n00313) bDMARDs carry a warning about the increased risk of lymphomas, based on early studies primarily with TNFi.​[[78]](#c0060n00288) However, long-term observational studies and database information indicate that the risk of malignancy with the use of bDMARDs is low.​[[32]](#c0060n00311)​[[77]](#c0060n00313)​[[79]](#Wadstrom2017) Patients with RA, regardless of therapy, are at increased risk of lymphoma compared to the general population and this needs to be taken into consideration when discussing malignancy risk. Long-term observational studies comparing RA patients on bDMARDs to RA patients not on bDMARDs have not found an increased risk of most cancers, although TNFi have been associated with a small increased risk of nonmelanomatous and invasive melanomatous skin cancer.​[[80]](#c0060n00386)

Health Canada has issued a safety alert advising that all JAK inhibitors may increase risk of malignancies.​[[81]](#HCsafetyJAKi) In head-to-head trials comparing tofacitinib with TNFi, the incidence rates of cancer were higher among RA patients receiving tofacitinib and in those with additional risk factors (e.g., current or past smokers).​[[82]](#Ytterberg2017)​[[83]](#Curtis2022) The number of patients exposed for 5 years needed to harm, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, was 55.​[[83]](#Curtis2022) Caution is therefore recommended in patients ≥65 years of age, current or past smokers, and those with a history of malignancy.​[[81]](#HCsafetyJAKi)

### Dyslipidemia and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Patients with RA may have a paradoxical association between lipid levels and cardiovascular risk, where lower total cholesterol and LDL levels are associated with higher cardiovascular risk.​[[84]](#Myasoedova2011)​[[85]](#Amezaga2012)​[[86]](#Liao2015) Increases in total cholesterol and LDL have been observed in bDMARDs and csDMARD therapy, especially with tocilizumab and JAK inhibitors.​[[87]](#Curtis2012)​[[88]](#Schiff2011)​[[89]](#Souto2015)​[[90]](#Taylor2018) It is unclear whether this increase is due to the control of inflammation or to the mechanism of action of these drugs. Lipid-lowering agents (e.g., statins) may be effective in decreasing lipids to baseline (i.e., pretreatment) levels.​[[88]](#Schiff2011)

Chronic inflammation in patients with RA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Controlling disease activity is essential for lowering cardiovascular disease risk in patients with RA.​[[91]](#Agca2017AnnRheum) The cardiovascular risk decrease associated with controlled disease activity has been observed with TNFi therapy and methotrexate.​[[92]](#Roubille2015JRheumatol)​[[93]](#Singh2019)​[[94]](#Widdifield2019) However, in patients with additional CV risk factors, use of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib was associated with higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with TNFi.​[[82]](#Ytterberg2017) It is unclear whether this difference in CV risk is due to the protective effect of TNFi or to an increased risk with tofacitinib. Since the risk associated with the JAK inhibitors class cannot be ruled out, Canadian labelling for all JAK inhibitors will be updated to include the risk of MACE.​[[81]](#HCsafetyJAKi) In patients ≥65 years of age, current or past smokers, or those with additional CV risk factors, JAK inhibitors should be considered only when response to TNFi is incomplete or associated with unacceptable adverse effects.

### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

NSAIDs have a role as an adjunct in relieving pain, but have no effect on underlying disease processes. NSAID use should be on an as needed basis and at the lowest effective dosage to minimize the risk of side effects (renal, hematological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular). Traditional NSAIDs (see Osteoarthritis, Table 2) are believed to be effective via their inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). Some adverse reactions to NSAIDs, including GI effects, may result from their inhibition of COX-1, whereas an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events may be linked to the inhibition of COX-2. The efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors is similar to nonselective NSAIDs but with less GI side effects and risk of bleeding. Patients with heart disease should be on concurrent low-dose ASA, with appropriate gastroprotection if they are at risk of peptic ulcer disease, and should avoid use of ibuprofen over other NSAIDs.​[[95]](#c0060n00065)

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids rapidly reduce inflammation and can provide significant benefit as a bridging agent early on in RA treatment.​[[96]](#c0060n00167) Chronic low doses of prednisone (≤10 mg/day) may have disease-modifying properties,​[[97]](#c0060n00168) but are not recommended for routine use due to concerns over long-term toxicity. However, when initiating or changing csDMARDs, short-term, low-dose corticosteroid therapy (30 mg/day prednisone with tapering) should be considered.​[[7]](#EULAR2019)​[[99]](#c0060n00307)​[[100]](#Stouten2019) High-dose corticosteroids do not confer any added benefit when initiating therapy with MTX and are associated with more adverse effects.​[[98]](#Verscheun2019)​[[100]](#Stouten2019) Prednisone is the preferred oral preparation because of its moderate glucocorticoid potency, intermediate duration of action and low mineralocorticoid potency. Depot preparations (e.g., triamcinolone, methylprednisolone) are also used as bridging therapy.​[[101]](#c0060n00169) All depot preparations of corticosteroids may cause atrophy after infiltration of superficial subcutaneous soft tissues, and caution is warranted. These formulations, particularly triamcinolone, are typically injected into the gluteal muscle to lower the risk of lipoatrophy.

Because of low systemic absorption and the long duration of action, depot preparations may be more effective for a longer period of time. Depot formulations are also used for intra-articular injections to manage symptoms in a small number of joints. Using shorter-acting methylprednisolone **acetate** is recommended for small joints and tendon sheaths.

Corticosteroids are associated with a number of serious side effects, including metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypertension, muscle atrophy, truncal obesity), adrenal suppression, cataracts, infections and avascular necrosis. Corticosteroid use in RA patients has also been associated with an increased risk of MI.​[[102]](#c0060n00391) In combination with NSAIDs, corticosteroids increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Moreover, corticosteroids will further aggravate osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, conditions independently associated with RA. Oral corticosteroids as well as depot injections can also significantly increase blood sugar in patients with diabetes. A single injection can cause significant dysglycemia for up to 10 days and patients should be informed of this.​[[103]](#Waterbrook2017)

Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should take calcium (total intake of 1200 mg/day, preferably from diet) and vitamin D supplementation 800–2000 units/day.​[[104]](#ACR2017corticosteroids) Patients may also require treatment with a bisphosphonate (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid; see Osteoporosis) to prevent the bone loss associated with corticosteroid use.​[[104]](#ACR2017corticosteroids)​[[105]](#c0060n00325) They should also be considered for prophylactic gastroprotective therapy, particularly with concomitant NSAID use.

### Analgesia

Rheumatoid arthritis is increasingly recognized as a chronic pain syndrome.​[[106]](#c0060n00171) Many adjunctive medications and alternative therapies are being used to treat it. Although controlled trials supporting their effectiveness in RA are not available, some therapies (including acetaminophen) are compatible with the medications used to treat RA and have fewer serious side effects than NSAIDs.

Opioids should be avoided if possible; there is limited direct evidence of their efficacy in patients with RA.​[[107]](#c0060n00393)

There is no data to support use of cannabinoids for the treatment of pain or inflammation in RA.​[[17]](#Fitzcharles2019)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Rheumatoid Arthritis and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Pregnancy itself has a favourable influence on disease activity, with 60% of patients experiencing improvement while pregnant.​[[108]](#Jethwa2019) Medications may be reduced or discontinued during pregnancy, but many patients may require drug therapy during all or a portion of the pregnancy. Disease flares are common postpartum, with nearly 50% experiencing an increase in disease activity after delivery. The influence of breastfeeding on the risk of disease flare is uncertain.​[[109]](#c0060n00327)​[[110]](#c0060n00328) Medications stopped during pregnancy may be resumed postpartum depending on breastfeeding status and/or additional planned pregnancies.

### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

In patients of reproductive age, family planning should be discussed and adjustment of therapy considered before a planned pregnancy.​[[111]](#Gotestam2016AnnRheumDis)

Cohort studies reported that women with RA are more likely to take longer that 12 months to conceive and suggest that RA may have a negative effect on fertility in women.​[[112]](#Brouwer2015)

Patients of childbearing age should use reliable contraception while taking **methotrexate**. Methotrexate should be stopped in both males and females at least 3 months before attempting conception, and folic acid supplementation should be given. However, based on limited evidence, low-dose methotrexate may be compatible with paternal exposure.​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology)

Leflunomide is known to be teratogenic in animal studies and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Some experts consider it prudent to avoid the use of leflunomide in patients of childbearing potential. Limited evidence suggests that paternal exposure is not associated with increased risk.​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology) Women who wish to become pregnant after taking leflunomide are advised to undergo a drug elimination protocol consisting of cholestyramine 8 g TID or activated charcoal 50 g QID for 11 days each (not necessarily on consecutive days).​[[114]](#c0060n00251) The plasma concentration of leflunomide’s active metabolite is then measured on 2 separate occasions at least 2 weeks apart to confirm levels below 0.02 mg/L.​[[114]](#c0060n00251)​[[115]](#c0060n00252) Following the second plasma level confirmation, an additional waiting period of 3 months before conception is recommended in men,​[[114]](#c0060n00251) and some experts suggest a waiting period of 1–3 menstrual cycles in women.​[[115]](#c0060n00252) Without the drug elimination protocol, it could take up to 2 years for plasma levels to drop to below 0.02 mg/L, due to interindividual variation in drug clearance.​[[114]](#c0060n00251)​[[115]](#c0060n00252) In the case of unplanned pregnancy or any suspicion of pregnancy while taking leflunomide, women should contact their physician immediately; small studies have shown no adverse pregnancy outcomes in women who inadvertently became pregnant while on leflunomide and underwent the cholestyramine washout.​[[116]](#Chambers2010)​[[117]](#Berard2017)

Sulfasalazine may affect fertility in men. If patient is experiencing difficulty conceiving, temporary cessation of sulfasalazine for 3 months may be considered. Other causes of subfertility should also be investigated.​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology)

A small study suggest that paternal exposure to TNFi at the time of conception is not associated with negative pregnancy outcomes.​[[118]](#Micu2019)

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

- Corticosteroids are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In high doses, they have been associated with low birth weight in humans and cleft palate in animal models, but there is no evidence in humans that prednisone or methylprednisolone are teratogenic.​[[105]](#c0060n00325)
- Antifolate metabolic effects of methotrexate may cause open neural tube defects and other CNS abnormalities, facial anomalies, growth retardation as well as other problems; it is therefore contraindicated in pregnancy. Methotrexate also has abortifacient properties.​[[119]](#c0060n00172) Folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) should be continued during pregnancy in patients who were treated with low-dose methotrexate within 3 months prior to conception.
- Data relating to the use of hydroxychloroquine in pregnancy are scarce. Existing data do not indicate that the drug poses significant fetal risk.​[[119]](#c0060n00172) Despite concerns regarding a potential risk of kernicterus, sulfasalazine has been used in pregnancy with relative safety.​[[119]](#c0060n00172) Because sulfasalazine is a folic acid antagonist, folic acid supplementation should be used in women of reproductive age; 5 mg/day is recommended during pregnancy.​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology) Monitoring for hyperbilirubinemia is still recommended in fetuses exposed to sulfasalazine close to term.
- Adalimumab and etanercept can be used until the end of the second trimester, while infliximab may be used until 16 weeks of pregnancy.​[[111]](#Gotestam2016AnnRheumDis)​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology) Certolizumab is compatible with all trimesters of pregnancy.​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology) TNFi therapy during pregnancy may have implications on infant vaccination (particularly with live vaccines).​[[120]](#LING2016EXPERTVACCINES) Consult the specific population section of the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-immunization-guide.html), as well as vaccine-specific chapters for more information on vaccination of infants exposed to immunosuppressants in utero.
- There is limited information about abatacept, anakinra and tocilizumab in pregnancy;​[[113]](#Flint2016Rheumatology) however, unintentional exposure during the first trimester is unlikely to be harmful.
- While limited evidence suggests no increased risk of congenital malformations in infants exposed to rituximab, it should be avoided when possible due to concerns over B-cell depletion.​[[121]](#Das2018)
- NSAID use in the third trimester may be of concern. Because of antiprostaglandin effects, NSAIDs can increase the risk of fetal and maternal bleeding and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus; they can also interfere with labour onset or duration. The 2 most studied NSAIDs in pregnancy are ibuprofen and naproxen.

### Rheumatoid Arthritis and Breastfeeding

Patients with RA who choose to breastfeed may use corticosteroids, NSAIDs (short-acting agents are preferred), hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine (except in infants with hyperbilirubinemia), as discussed above. Methotrexate is secreted in low amounts into breast milk and is contraindicated. Leflunomide should also not be used, given the lack of data about transfer into breast milk. There are limited data for any of the bDMARDs and tsDMARDs, so decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, while considering the importance of the medication to the mother. Due to the lack of oral bioavailability of biological agents and the low amounts passed into breast milk due to the large molecular size, there appears to be little cause for concern in breastfed infants of mothers on biologics. Studies on the potential effect of biologics on infants’ gut microbiota are being undertaken.

### General Considerations

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.​[[122]](#Matro2018)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Referral to a rheumatologist and prompt institution of therapy is essential. Early, aggressive treatment is linked to a positive outcome in RA. Ideally, patients presenting suspected arthritis (joint swelling associated with pain and stiffness) should be referred to/be seen by a rheumatologist within 6 weeks of onset of symptoms.
- Although 70% of patients are seropositive (i.e., positive RF and/or ACPA) at initial presentation,​[[123]](#Moura2019) a negative RF or ACPA does not exclude the possibility of RA.
- Comorbidities including infections, cardiovascular disease, lymphoma and osteoporosis are common in RA patients. Routine care should include screening for and prevention and treatment of these conditions.​[[3]](#RoubilleC2015JRheumato)
- Patients with RA have a cardiovascular risk comparable to that of patients with diabetes mellitus.​[[124]](#Agca2019) This cardiovascular risk may be underestimated by established risk models, e.g., Framingham risk score.​[[125]](#ARTS2015AnnRheum) Controlling disease activity is essential for lowering cardiovascular disease risk.​[[91]](#Agca2017AnnRheum) TNFi therapy and methotrexate may significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with RA, while NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk.​[[92]](#Roubille2015JRheumatol)​[[93]](#Singh2019)​[[94]](#Widdifield2019)
- Fatigue is a common symptom that can be alleviated by achieving remission or low disease activity. Interventions such as physical activity and psychosocial intervention (e.g., self-help, coping strategies, talking therapies) have demonstrated benefit in some patients with persistent fatigue despite adequate disease control.​[[126]](#c0060n00445)​[[127]](#Hewlett2019)
