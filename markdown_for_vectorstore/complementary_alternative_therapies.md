### Introduction

The promotion of wellness to prevent disease and enhance quality of life has engaged individuals in proactive self-care. Greater public awareness about the importance of attaining and maintaining wellness has been accompanied by a remarkable increase in the use of unconventional therapies in patient self-care. These therapeutic approaches bring with them terminologies and philosophies that can be confusing to those trained in the conventional medical sciences typically practised in North America. A vital step in better understanding these approaches is recognition of the extent of use by Canadians, user demographics, reasons for use and patterns of use, all of which continue to evolve. Appreciating the diversity of treatments and the philosophies behind them, finding objective evidence to support or not support their use, and the efforts to integrate validated therapies into patient care are challenges facing Canada’s health-care practitioners.

### Definitions

Increased human mobility and improved global communication have led to increased awareness of and exposure to previously unfamiliar therapies and a greater exploration of these treatments by North Americans. Use has surged in developed nations, where these treatments are better known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).​[[1]](#psc1096n1001) It is challenging to define the spectrum of CAM approaches. As Western medicine becomes experienced with certain practices, the approaches become standard treatment and are no longer considered complementary or alternative. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) in the United States defines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health-care systems, practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. Conventional medicine (also called Western or allopathic medicine) is medicine as practised by holders of MD (Doctor of Medicine) and DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) degrees and by allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, pharmacists and registered nurses. The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not absolute, and specific CAM practices may become widely accepted over time.​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)

Although the terms “complementary” and “alternative” medicine are often used interchangeably, they are considered distinct.​[[2]](#psc1096n1038) Alternative medicine is used in place of Western medicine (e.g., using herbs rather than conventional pharmaceuticals to treat a condition), whereas **complementary medicine** is used in combination with conventional medicine. **Integrative medicine** combines conventional medicine and those complementary treatments for which there is sound evidence of effectiveness and safety, but does not replace conventional therapy (e.g., massage and guided imagery to ease pain).​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)​[[3]](#psc1096n1039)

### Prevalence

Although surveys of CAM use provide inconsistent findings because the definition of CAM varies (e.g., some include prayer in the definition, some include only supplements), they can still be useful to identify trends and patterns.​[[4]](#psc1096n01163) General trends include higher prevalence rates of CAM in Western regions, with women, and in those with higher levels of education and income.​[[5]](#refitem-123215-AF52F703)​[[6]](#psc1096n1006)​[[7]](#psc1096n1008)​[[8]](#psc1096n01164) In Canada, a 2010 Ipsos-Reid survey on the use of natural health products (NHPs) found that 73% of Canadians used NHPs (including vitamins). Similarly, 12% of the general Canadian population visited a CAM practitioner in the previous 12 months.​[[9]](#psc1096n01165) Surveys undertaken in various regions of Canada have demonstrated high use of CAM therapies by ethnic Chinese Canadians.​[[10]](#psc1096n1014)​[[11]](#psc1096n1015)​[[12]](#psc1096n1016) Some Indigenous communities also maintain traditional healing practices, as demonstrated by a study in Nova Scotia that found 66% of attendees to a clinic used Mi’kmaq medicine in addition to Western medicine.​[[13]](#psc1096n1017)

Another important determinant of CAM use is the presence of chronic or difficult-to-treat conditions.​[[5]](#refitem-123215-AF52F703)​[[6]](#psc1096n1006)​[[14]](#psc1096n1009) Patients with asthma, migraine headache and diabetes were more likely to have visited a CAM practitioner in the previous 12 months (15%, 19% and 8% respectively).​[[9]](#psc1096n01165) Surveyors hypothesized that patients with adequate control of their disease were less likely to seek alternatives.​[[9]](#psc1096n01165) This theory is supported by an analysis of consultations with alternative health-care practitioners (massage therapy, acupuncture, homeopathic/naturopathic treatment) in Ontario. Women with chronic conditions (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, high blood pressure, chemical sensitivities) were more likely to seek a CAM provider if they felt their health-care needs were not being met.​[[15]](#psc1096n01167) The incidence of lifetime use of a CAM product/therapy or visit to a CAM therapist was found to have increased in randomly selected breast cancer survivors in Ontario from 67% in 1998 to 82% in 2005, with 41% of respondents in 2005 reporting use of CAM to manage their cancer.​[[16]](#psc1096n1005) The use of CAM by pediatric cancer patients since diagnosis was 20–60% in the majority of studies included in a systematic review.​[[17]](#psc1096n01169) Other studies have found similar CAM usage in Canadian pediatric patients in cardiology and neurology clinics.​[[18]](#refitem-1232122-AF54716B)​[[19]](#refitem-1232123-AF54B568)

Chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions prompt patients to seek alternatives, and those facing devastating diseases turn to CAM when conventional treatments have been exhausted (although most patients with life-threatening conditions do not use CAM exclusively).

### Safety

Although Canadian consumers desire reliable information on CAM, they often base their choices on potentially unreliable or unsubstantiated sources. While scientific evidence and advice from health-care practitioners affect their choices, patients give strong consideration to the treatment’s “naturalness,” perceived lack of side effects, and advice from friends and family when deciding to use CAM treatments.​[[20]](#refitem-1232124-AFBB36A8)​[[21]](#refitem-1232125-AFBB74D0) Claims by unscrupulous manufacturers and distributors can mislead and confuse consumers with pseudoscientific jargon and rhetoric.​[[22]](#psc1096n1018)​[[23]](#psc1096n01170) In Canada, although NHPs require premarket approval and evidence to support efficacy, safety and quality, and must meet labelling standards, verbal claims are often made by health-food store personnel despite lack of supporting evidence.​[[24]](#psc1096n1021) A lack of knowledge of basic safety issues such as herb-drug interactions and contraindications increases the risks of an adverse outcome when such personnel provide advice.​[[25]](#psc1096n01171) Of additional concern is the lack of accreditation or standards for some CAM practitioners in Canada.​[[26]](#psc1096n01172)

A 2010 Ipsos-Reid survey of Canadians regarding NHPs demonstrated increasing public awareness regarding NHP safety issues, with physicians and pharmacists the most preferred NHP information sources. Nonetheless, many Canadian consumers are reluctant to discuss NHP usage with conventional health-care practitioners, fearing lack of support in their decisions to choose NHPs and doubt regarding the consumer’s values and beliefs.​[[27]](#psc1096n01174) It has been estimated that less than 1% of those who use NHPs disclose this information to their pharmacist.​[[28]](#psc1096n01175) Case reports have highlighted that using a stepwise approach to conducting a medication history can identify NHP use and prevent unnecessary harm.​[[29]](#refitem-1232134-AFBC8F04) This approach is recommended as part of Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) guidelines.​[[30]](#refitem-1232135-AFBD4890)

When assessing the safety of CAM therapies, in addition to potential harm caused directly by the therapies themselves, practitioners must also consider indirect harm that may arise from choosing less effective CAM treatments over conventional methods that have proven efficacy.​[[31]](#refitem-1232136-AFBDDF47) For example, patients may choose a CAM treatment over surgery and chemotherapy for cancer treatment, and this may contribute to disease progression. Factors such as the severity and acuteness of the illness, safety and efficacy of the desired CAM treatment, and toxicity associated with conventional treatment must be considered in the risk-benefit analysis of CAM versus conventional medical treatment.

### Integrative Medicine

Integrative initiatives are fostering closer collaboration between conventional and CAM practitioners to deliver a more comprehensive approach to patient care. Integration can occur on different levels—as individual practitioners combine therapies (e.g., physicians performing acupuncture) or in integrative clinics and institutions where conventional and CAM practitioners work together.​[[32]](#psc1096n1003) Collaboration and communication between conventional and CAM practitioners will improve monitoring of adverse effects, identify potential therapeutic benefits of an integrative approach and foster progress through research.​[[33]](#psc1096n01183) Additionally, working in a collaborative integrated environment positively affects job satisfaction and personal growth of Canadian practitioners.​[[34]](#psc1096n01184) In Alberta, the [CAM in UME Project](http://www.cimadoctors.ca/the-cam-in-ume-project) (Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Undergraduate Medical Education) is a medical education initiative to facilitate educating undergraduate medical education students about issues related to patients’ use of CAM . The project does not teach medical students how to practise complementary therapy, but to be prepared to practise medicine in an environment where CAM may be used by their patients in combination with conventional treatments.​[[35]](#psc1096n1028) Other Canadian examples of initiatives to promote integrative medicine include Integrative Health Institute (IHI) learners program, which is an integrative medicine program at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) and [InspireHealth](https://www.inspirehealth.ca/), an integrative cancer care program with several centres in British Columbia.

With the increasing use of CAM therapies, and the integration into mainstream medical practice, health-care practitioners must become familiar with relevant terminology. The following provides definitions and brief descriptions of categories of CAM and therapeutic modalities that health-care practitioners may encounter in this evolving area.

### Categories of CAM

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health in the United States groups CAM therapies into 5 major categories (see also [Table 1](#n01218) and [Table 2](#n01221)).

**Alternative Medical Systems**​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)

These are complex and comprehensive systems of treatment, encompassing both theory and practice, that have developed outside the sphere of conventional medicine. Some have been in use for thousands of years (e.g., Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]), while others have been developed more recently (e.g., homeopathy). Besides TCM and homeopathy, alternative medical systems also include ayurveda and naturopathic medicine (see [Definition of Therapeutic Modalities](#psc1096n01104)).

**Energy Therapies**​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)

These methods seek to manipulate energy fields (biofields) within or surrounding the body (see [Table 1](#n01218)). In TCM, this is referred to as qi (pronounced “chee”), which is the vital life force that circulates through the body in invisible pathways termed meridians. In ayurveda, these life forces are referred to as doshas. The underlying theory maintains that the universe is permeated with a “life force” or “vital energy” that also surrounds and pervades the human body.​[[36]](#psc1096n1049) Imbalance or blockages of the energy may result in disease, and therapy is aimed at correcting these problems. For treatment of a condition, a close, cooperative participation between the practitioner and the patient is required. Therapeutic touch, reiki and qigong are examples of energy therapies.

**Manipulative and Body-Based Methods**​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[38]](#psc1096n1046)​[[39]](#psc1096n1047)

These manual therapies (e.g., chiropractic and massage therapy) involve manipulation or movement of the body (see [Table 1](#n01218)). Some methods propose that bodily function depends on proper body alignment, and that misalignment or asymmetry results in illness, possibly at a site distant from the distortion. Correction of body symmetry optimizes the balance between the sensory and motor nervous systems.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045) Restoration of structural imbalance to improve blood and lymph flow is one of the proposed mechanisms by which these therapies facilitate the body’s ability to heal itself.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)

**Mind-Body Interventions**​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)​[[40]](#psc1096n1040)​[[41]](#psc1096n1041)​[[42]](#psc1096n1042)

These therapies utilize the brain or mind to influence body function (see [Table 1](#n01218)). The concept that the mind can influence illness is integral in the healing approaches of traditional Chinese and ayurvedic medical systems.​[[43]](#psc1096n01161) Evidence from RCTs and systematic reviews suggests a connection between the nervous system and other body systems (e.g., the immune, autonomic and endocrine systems), which may be activated to promote self-healing and well-being. Observed positive psychological effects and enhanced quality of life may be of particular use for individuals with chronic conditions and in need of palliative care. The connection between the mind and body has been explored in the use of support groups for cancer patients (now considered mainstream therapy) and in the effect of exercise on altered mood (e.g., increased endorphins to combat depression). In pediatrics, hypnosis, guided imagery and biofeedback have been used effectively to manage pain, anxiety, stress and sleep disorders.​[[44]](#psc1096n1010) Mind-body interventions are considered low risk.

**Natural Product–Based Therapies**​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)

Also known as biologically based practices, this describes the use of natural/biologic products, which can be derived from plants (e.g., herbs) or animals (e.g., shark cartilage), and also includes vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, prebiotics, probiotics, whole diets and functional foods (see [Table 1](#n01218)). Orthomolecular and megavitamin therapies are also in this category.

### Definition of Therapeutic Modalities

### Acupressure

Acupressure is a manual therapy that applies deep pressure to certain acupuncture points.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051) It is theorized that different noxious stimuli, including emotional trauma, cause energy to accumulate in particular pressure points situated along the channels or meridians through which qi flows. Application of pressure by the practitioner improves flow of qi, causing a release and dissipation of tension, alleviation of disease, and relief of pain.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045) It has been studied for the treatment of nausea of pregnancy, headache, backache, stroke, pain associated with chemotherapy and traumatic brain injury.​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)​[[47]](#psc1096n1052) Application of pressure to a particular point on the inside of the wrist has been promoted to alleviate motion sickness; however, there is limited evidence to support its efficacy.​[[48]](#psc1096n1053)

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture can describe either a therapeutic discipline or a technique that can vary with different traditional approaches and is practised by both conventional and CAM practitioners.​[[49]](#psc1096n1054) Needles of various sizes, but commonly having a shaft of 25 mm and a diameter of 0.25 mm, are inserted at specific points on the body to regulate the flow of qi along chosen meridians.​[[50]](#psc1096n1055)​[[51]](#psc1096n1056) In a more conventional approach, these acupuncture points are termed “trigger points,” which correspond to areas of increased sensitivity that can produce referred pain in a characteristic manner.​[[52]](#psc1096n1057) Anatomically, these points often correspond to peripheral nerve junctions and may be involved in pain transmission. The technique itself involves the insertion of several needles (usually 4–10), and may vary with respect to angle and depth of insertion, length of time retained (often 10–30 min), manipulation methods (e.g., twirling, electrical current), and frequency of treatment.​[[52]](#psc1096n1057) Variations on needle therapy include Shiatsu, moxibustion, acupressure and electric currents. Areas of interest in acupuncture treatment include pain management, including postoperative dental pain, headache, substance abuse, nausea, asthma, urticaria and stroke rehabilitation.​[[47]](#psc1096n1052)​[[52]](#psc1096n1057)​[[53]](#psc1096n1058)​[[54]](#psc1096n1059)​[[55]](#psc1096n1060) Neural pathways, neurotransmitters and hormonal factors are believed to be affected by acupuncture.​[[56]](#psc1096n1061) Research supports the use of acupuncture in pain secondary to temporomandibular dysfunction, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, low back pain and idiopathic headache,​[[57]](#psc1096n1062)​[[58]](#psc1096n01185) including recurrent headache in children.​[[44]](#psc1096n1010)​[[59]](#psc1096n1012) Systematic reviews have concluded acupuncture is an option for conditions such as chronic pain,​[[60]](#psc1096n01186) migraine prophylaxis​[[61]](#psc1096n1063) and tension-type headache.​[[62]](#psc1096n1064)

### Applied Kinesiology

This diagnostic technique used by chiropractors and other practitioners is distinct from kinesiology and uses acupressure points and muscle strength testing to identify health and nutritional problems.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) Practitioners assert that weakness in particular muscles corresponds to specific illnesses or deficiencies that can be corrected by manipulation or supplements.

### Aromatherapy

Aromatherapy is a treatment method using volatile (essential) oils derived from plants whose fragrance or odour is deemed an integral part of therapy.​[[64]](#psc1096n1066) The oils are extracted from plants, diluted with vegetable oil then often applied to the skin by massage, or they can be delivered in steam for inhalation of the scent.​[[46]](#psc1096n1051) When applied externally, the fragrance, the massage itself and the dermal absorption of the constituents are all deemed beneficial,​[[65]](#psc1096n1067) although a psychological component cannot be ruled out.​[[40]](#psc1096n1040) In the United Kingdom, aromatherapy has been used in conventional settings such as hospices, palliative care units, cancer units and pediatric units.​[[64]](#psc1096n1066)

### Ayurveda

Ayurveda is a major medical system that originated in India and possibly dates back as much as 5000 years.​[[2]](#psc1096n1038)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)​[[66]](#psc1096n1068)​[[67]](#psc1096n1069) It is a complex system of theory and practise, which considers the body, mind and spirit, and attempts to achieve harmony and balance between them. It is believed that the body is a miniature representation of the universe. The same elements that form the universe form the human body; when the elements are out of balance (i.e., imbalance within the body or between the body and the environment), ill health results. Patient assessment includes physical examination as well as consideration of mental and social factors. Treatment choices include manipulation, diet, yoga, meditation, purification to rid the body of toxins (possibly involving vomiting, purging or enemas) and rejuvenation therapies to build the body’s strength. Herbal therapies are employed, as well as minerals and metals, which might include heavy metals. As with other herbal therapies, the safety of ayurvedic herbs may be questionable, as lead poisoning has occurred following the use of ayurvedic remedies.​[[68]](#psc1096n1071)

### Biofeedback

Biofeedback is a system that permits a patient to regulate body function (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, degree of muscle contraction) by receiving feedback signals from instruments monitoring a particular physiological function (e.g., brain waves) and to adjust the physiologic process accordingly.​[[46]](#psc1096n1051) It may be effective for varied conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, bladder disorders, asthma, headache, post-traumatic stress disorder, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)

### Chinese Herbal Medicine

Chinese herbal medicine, which encompasses the use of animal parts and minerals in addition to plant material, is an integral part of TCM.​[[50]](#psc1096n1055)​[[69]](#psc1096n1072) Substances can be categorized according to their properties, which include heat clearing, wind dispelling or blood rectifying. The use of medicinal substances can be complex, with specific combinations selected based on their compatibility and complementary/synergistic effects.​[[70]](#psc1096n1073) Typical combinations contain 2–40 herbs in differing amounts, and the combination is adjusted during the course of treatment according to the clinical presentation.​[[69]](#psc1096n1072) They are usually consumed as a decoction (simmered tea) but also may be dispensed in solid dosage forms or used externally. Be aware that some imported herbal products may contain contaminants or be otherwise adulterated.

### Chiropractic

Chiropractic health care is a body-manipulation therapy aimed at correcting misalignment within the musculoskeletal system.​[[39]](#psc1096n1047) Chiropractors apply a variety of maneuvers, such as sharp thrusts, to the spine, pelvis and limbs in order to adjust alignment and correct disorders.​[[71]](#psc1096n1074) Although formerly advocated for treating a wide variety of complaints, today it is limited primarily to treating musculoskeletal disorders. There is evidence for its use in acute low back pain and in tension-type and migraine headache.​[[39]](#psc1096n1047)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) While rare, stroke or vertebral artery dissection have followed manipulation of the neck, although causation has not been established.​[[39]](#psc1096n1047)

### Craniosacral Therapy

Craniosacral therapy is a manual technique in which gentle pressure is applied to the skull to adjust and normalize rhythmic pulsations of the cerebrospinal fluid.​[[72]](#psc1096n1075)​[[73]](#psc1096n1076) It has been purported to relieve pain (e.g., headache) and vertigo.​[[74]](#Arnadottir2013)​[[75]](#Christine2009)

### Cupping and Bleeding

This is a component of TCM in which a warm glass or bamboo cup is placed on the skin. As it cools, the suction created draws blood and lymph to the skin surface. It is used to assist circulation and to remove “cold and damp,” which are considered external causes of disease.​[[50]](#psc1096n1055)​[[72]](#psc1096n1075) In the Old World, healers believed that cupping would relieve a variety of ailments, from toothache to elephantiasis.​[[51]](#psc1096n1056)

### Dietary Supplements

This term has various interpretations. In the United States, it is defined by the *Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act* (1994) as a product intended to supplement the diet that may contain 1 or more dietary ingredients including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals and other substances.​[[76]](#psc1096n1077) It is an oral dosage form (pill, tablet, capsule or liquid) and must be labelled as a dietary supplement. Its intended use is to resolve a nutritional deficiency or to improve or sustain the function of the body. If used to diagnose, prevent, treat or cure a disease, it is considered a drug, and not a dietary supplement. The Act does not require proof of efficacy or safety nor standardization.​[[76]](#psc1096n1077) The accepted regulatory term in Canada is Natural Health Product (NHP), which is defined differently (see [Natural Health Products](#psc1096n01134)).

### Functional Foods

According to Health Canada, “a functional food is similar in appearance to, or may be, a conventional food, is consumed as part of a usual diet, and is demonstrated to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions.”​[[77]](#psc1096n1078) Functional foods are developed through various means, including fortification with vitamins and/or minerals beyond mandatory requirements, addition of bioactive ingredients, and enhancement of bioactive components through processes such as plant breeding and special livestock feeding. Examples of foods that are thought to have benefit by supplying biologically active ingredients are eggs enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, tomatoes rich in lycopene and cereals containing oat bran.​[[78]](#psc1096n1079) Exemptions in Canada’s *Food and Drugs Regulations* have allowed some functional foods to carry health claims; for example, margarine containing plant sterols may claim on its label to reduce cholesterol.​[[79]](#refitem-12321114-AFD1D15A)

### Functional Medicine

Functional medicine is a patient-centred care model that integrates conventional and CAM practices, and considers the interplay between environment, lifestyle, genetics and mind-body factors and their influence on the health of an individual. Nutrition, diet and exercise are strategies emphasized in disease prevention; conventional diagnostic and treatment methods are combined as necessary with CAM therapies in treatment.​[[80]](#psc1096n01191)

### Herbalism

Herbalism is an approach that uses plant-based medicines as substitutes for pharmaceuticals and as vehicles to optimize health and wellness. The WHO has taken the position that, in the absence of opposing scientific evidence, the traditional and historical use of herbal remedies provides evidence of their efficacy and safety;​[[81]](#psc1096n1080)​[[82]](#psc1096n1081) it has also published a document to guide quality control in herbal medicines.​[[83]](#psc1096n01192) Medical herbalism has been a sustained therapeutic approach in numerous countries, including Western nations such as Germany where modern pharmacology and herbalism successfully coexist.​[[1]](#psc1096n1001) The entire plant kingdom, including moss, algae and fungi, may be utilized (although some herbal traditions also use animal parts, insects, metals, rocks or shells).​[[84]](#psc1096n1082) The basis of herbalism is the belief that the physiological response to a plant will be different than the response to an individual chemical component of the plant.​[[72]](#psc1096n1075) Growing conditions and collection and storage methods will also affect response, as will the expectations of the patient and the cultural significance of the plant (which may contribute to increased placebo response).

### Holistic Medicine

This is an approach that takes into account the body, mind and spirit of an individual, as well as his or her interaction, to maintain health and well-being.​[[72]](#psc1096n1075)​[[85]](#psc1096n1083) Some argue that competent physicians have always done this, and that it is not the exclusive domain of CAM practitioners.​[[3]](#psc1096n1039) What might be termed a holistic approach, the practice of involving multidisciplinary teams (physicians, spiritual healers and psychological counsellors) has been successfully incorporated into conventional medical practices.​[[86]](#psc1096n1084)​[[87]](#psc1096n1085)

### Homeopathy

Homeopathy is an alternative medical system dating back to the early nineteenth century based on the philosophy that the body has an innate ability to heal itself, and that “like cures like.”​[[38]](#psc1096n1046)​[[49]](#psc1096n1054)​[[88]](#psc1096n1086)​[[89]](#psc1096n1087) It teaches that symptoms are manifested when the body attempts to heal itself or to correct an imbalance. The presenting symptoms guide therapy. The premise is that a substance that produces a specific pattern of symptoms in a healthy person will, when given in homeopathic doses, help fight an illness with identical symptomatology. Homeopathic remedies are chosen based on the mental and emotional state of the patient, in addition to the physical. Therapies are highly individualized and, in general, should be made only by a trained homeopath. The closest match between the symptoms of the individual and the remedy is attempted, recognizing that different people will exhibit different symptom patterns. There are more than 2000 homeopathic substances, which are derived from plants, minerals, metals, animal products and even diseased tissues. The substances are prepared in serial dilutions, which are vigorously shaken with each dilution, which is believed to increase potency. Potencies are typically noted as X or C, indicating 1:10 dilutions or 1:100 dilutions, respectively, e.g., 6X will denote 6 dilutions of 1:10. The goal of the dilution process is to have no molecules of the original substance exist in the final preparation. Paradoxically, the greater the dilution, the higher the potency. Preparations of highest potency are reserved for use under the direction of a homeopath. In North America, asthma, headache, depression, allergies, psychosocial problems and skin conditions are among the most frequent conditions treated by homeopaths. In the United Kingdom, homeopathy is often used in children to treat minor, self-limiting conditions.​[[90]](#psc1096n01193) Homeopathic medicines are regulated as NHPs in Canada, and authorized products are identified by an 8-digit Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM).​[[91]](#refitem-12321126-AFD318E6) The WHO has developed a document addressing safety issues in homeopathic remedies.​[[92]](#psc1096n01194) The WHO considers the hazards related to the source materials (e.g., animal and human materials, contaminated plant materials or microorganisms) and the hazards related to the procedures used for manufacture of the homeopathic product (e.g., accidental or intentional contamination of source materials or the vessels in which dilutions were made) as the major 2 groups of potential hazards.​[[92]](#psc1096n01194) Quality control of homeopathic remedies is a major concern that must be addressed to ensure the safety of these products.

### Hydrotherapy

Hydrotherapy includes a multitude of diverse applications, including baths, saunas, douches, immersion, wraps and colonic irrigations, where water is used as the main tool of the therapeutic intervention.​[[51]](#psc1096n1056)​[[93]](#psc1096n1088)

### Hypnotherapy

Hypnotherapy is used to induce a state of relaxation by selective attentional focusing using imagery or distraction, where intrusive thoughts can be ignored.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[59]](#psc1096n1012)​[[94]](#psc1096n1089) It includes a suggestive component where therapeutic goals can be introduced, e.g., a pain-free state. It is possible to maintain the behaviour once the hypnotic state has been terminated. Muscle relaxation, altered perception and cognitive distraction are possible mechanisms.​[[94]](#psc1096n1089) It has been found useful in coping with pain, distress and anxiety in children with cancer undergoing bone marrow aspiration.​[[59]](#psc1096n1012) Current evidence is insufficient to determine whether hypnotherapy is beneficial for smoking cessation and any effect is likely to be small.​[[95]](#Barnes2019)

### Imagery

Imagery involves the use of directed mental images to promote changes in attitudes or behaviour, relieve symptoms or encourage physical healing. The process may be guided by a practitioner, or patients can be instructed in its application. It is often used for alleviation of stress and its sequelae including insomnia. It is thought to reduce the need for the use of analgesics in cancer patients.​[[59]](#psc1096n1012)

### Iridology

Iridology is a discredited method of diagnosis that examines changes in the iris to determine state of health.​[[40]](#psc1096n1040)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)

### Magnet Therapy

Magnet therapy involves the application of magnets to treat disorders by influencing ionic currents in the body causing stimulation of cells and enhancing blood flow.​[[73]](#psc1096n1076)​[[96]](#psc1096n01157) It is not to be confused with magnetic healing, which is a form of hypnosis. Unipolar or bipolar magnets are fastened into clothing, worn like jewellery (e.g., bracelets), held in place against the skin by adhesive or used in bedding. They have been promoted to treat musculoskeletal complaints such as chronic low back pain, muscle pain in postpolio syndrome and neuropathic pain in diabetes, although a systematic review did not support their use for pain relief.​[[96]](#psc1096n01157)

### Massage Therapy

Massage therapy is a manipulative method that uses a variety of manual techniques (stroking, kneading, friction, vibration) applied to soft tissues.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[39]](#psc1096n1047) Human touch itself is considered to be a beneficial part of massage. It is used in traditional medical systems, including ayurveda and TCM. Massage is used to promote relaxation, relieve muscle tightness, alleviate pain, reduce anxiety and promote sleep. It is used to promote the growth and development of premature infants​[[44]](#psc1096n1010) and might benefit patients suffering from anxiety and chronic cancer pain.​[[59]](#psc1096n1012) It should not be used in patients with deep vein thrombosis, advanced osteoporosis, fractures or where skin is compromised.​[[39]](#psc1096n1047)

### Meditation

Meditation is one of the most commonly used mind-body interventions to induce relaxation and a sense of calm.​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) It is a self-directed practice that involves a conscious mental process of becoming aware of one’s thoughts and achieving mastery over them. It is becoming increasingly recommended in Western conventional medicine, as it has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety.​[[97]](#psc1096n01195) Functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that meditation can activate areas of the brain involved in attention and in the control of the autonomic nervous system. It is an element of different traditional medical systems, including TCM and ayurveda as a component of yoga, qigong and tai chi. Preliminary evidence has found that some meditation techniques alter blood flow in the brain, lower blood pressure, slow respiratory rate, improve immune function, help with coping strategies and provide a positive emotional state.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)​[[94]](#psc1096n1089)

### Moxibustion

Moxibustion is a component of TCM that involves the burning of dried and powdered leaves of *Artemisia vulgaris*.​[[50]](#psc1096n1055) They can be burned in very small amounts directly on the skin, on a mediating substance placed between the burning material and the skin surface, or on the handle of an acupuncture needle. It is believed that the burning substance has the ability to enter the meridians and affect the flow of qi. Moxibustion is used in combination with acupuncture for a wide variety of conditions.

### Natural Health Products

Natural health products have been regulated in Canada since 2004.​[[91]](#refitem-12321126-AFD318E6) According to Health Canada, the definition of an NHP includes both function and substance.​[[98]](#refitem-12321133-0096E3D5) Function captures substances for use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease/disorder, restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in a manner that maintains or promotes health. Acceptable substances include materials derived from plants, algae, bacteria, fungi and non-human animals; these include vitamins and minerals, herbal remedies, homeopathic medicines, traditional medicines like TCM, probiotics, and other products like amino acids and essential fatty acids. Numerous exclusions are listed, such as antibiotics, blood products, tobacco, injectables, biologics, cannabis and others. Natural health products must be safe for use, as patients self-select products, which are available for purchase without the consultation of a health-care practitioner. Premarket authorization is required for sale. Manufacturers must provide evidence that products are safe, effective and of high quality before obtaining a product licence, although the type of evidence varies depending on whether the product has a traditional use claim (supported by traditional evidence) or a modern use claim (typically supported by randomized controlled trials).​[[98]](#refitem-12321133-0096E3D5)​[[99]](#refitem-12321132-0096E18F)

Contamination is a frequent problem with imported NHPs due to lack of rigorous manufacturing standards. In particular, many Chinese herbal products are the subject of Health Canada warnings for containing undeclared medications, bacteria and fungi; most of these are not authorized for sale in Canada.​[[100]](#psc1096n01213)​[[101]](#psc1096n01214)​[[102]](#psc1096n01215) Practitioners should be reminded to recommend only NHPs that are authorized for sale in Canada, as indicated by a Natural Product Number (NPN), Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM) or Exemption Number (EN).

### Naturopathic Medicine

Naturopathic medicine is a system of treatment, defined by a broad scope of practice, that emphasizes the healing power of nature, and which draws from a wide variety of therapeutic approaches.​[[93]](#psc1096n1088)​[[103]](#psc1096n1091)​[[104]](#psc1096n1092) The use of nutrition, herbs and natural products is fundamental, with treatments borrowed from TCM, homeopathy, herbalism, ayurveda and manual therapies. As it does not identify with one particular mode of therapy, it is generally defined by its approach. This includes core principles of preventive medicine, treatment of the whole person and determination of the cause of the disease. Treatment combinations are individualized for each patient in an effort to aid self-healing and restore normal body function, rather than attempt to focus on the treatment of symptoms. Interventions include natural products, nutritional counselling, acupuncture, naturopathic manipulation, TCM, homeopathy and many others.​[[104]](#psc1096n1092)

### Nutraceutical

Health Canada defines a nutraceutical as “a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food. A nutraceutical is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease.”​[[77]](#psc1096n1078) From a legal standpoint, these products are regulated as NHPs in Canada. The concentrated dosage forms can deliver ingredients in amounts exceeding those found in food.​[[22]](#psc1096n1018) Examples include omega-3 fatty acids derived from marine sources and isoflavones isolated from soy, sold in capsule form.

### Orthomolecular Therapy

Orthomolecular therapy is a term derived from the Greek word “orthos,” meaning straight or correct, and was first used by Linus Pauling in 1968 to describe the treatment of disease with large quantities of nutrients, especially vitamins.​[[46]](#psc1096n1051) It is similar to megavitamin therapy but minerals, amino acids, hormones and metabolic intermediates can also be administered. The amount of nutrients administered may be 20–600 times the recommended daily intake.

### Osteopathic Medicine

Osteopathic medicine is a system that originated as a manipulative method, but has evolved into mainstream medicine in the United States, where practitioners receive a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) degree and restrict themselves to conventional medicine.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[71]](#psc1096n1074)​[[105]](#psc1096n1094) Underlying principles are based on an appreciation of the connection between the body’s tissues, fluids and systems; treatment is aimed at restoring integrity of structures and improving interactions of the body’s systems. Osteopaths perform various practices, which include manual techniques that combine manipulation and massage therapy, such as thrusting (similar to chiropractic methods), lymphatic drainage and craniosacral therapy (similar to massage therapy). Osteopathic methods attempt to correct symmetry, motion restriction, tissue texture changes and tenderness. In countries other than the United States, such as Great Britain, osteopaths earn Bachelor of Science degrees and have practices similar to that of chiropractors.

### Qigong

Qigong is an energy therapy that is a major branch of TCM and is aimed at manipulating qi (vital force or energy that circulates through the body in invisible pathways termed meridians).​[[50]](#psc1096n1055) It involves a wide variety of activities to balance, regulate and harness qi in order to promote health, longevity, healing and spiritual development. An internal form has the patient acting alone using exercise, breathing or relaxation methods. In the external form, practitioners project their qi into the patient via their hands, the use of needles or visualization. In healthy volunteers, qigong has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, and might be of use to relieve stress.​[[94]](#psc1096n1089) Other potential benefits include the management of hypertension and respiratory disease.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044) Qigong may also improve quality of life for cancer patients.​[[106]](#psc1096n01196)

### Reflexology (Zone Therapy)

Reflexology is a manual technique in which the practitioner applies deep pressure using his or her fingers and thumbs on the patient’s feet.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[65]](#psc1096n1067) Different zones on the feet are thought to correspond to areas on the body (equated with meridians), and application of pressure is thought to enhance the flow of energy in the body. Reflexology has been applied for the relief of symptoms associated with chronic conditions, such as asthma, headache, and bladder or bowel problems, and to patients suffering stroke, brain injury, or spinal cord injury.​[[47]](#psc1096n1052)

### Reiki

Reiki is an energy therapy developed in the mid-nineteenth century whereby practitioners channel the universal life energy (i.e., reiki) through meditation and prayer from their own body to the patient’s in order to promote healing.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[36]](#psc1096n1049) It has been used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, pain, cancer and depression, as well as for overall well-being, but research has not confirmed usefulness for any condition.​[[107]](#psc1096n01197)

### Relaxation

Relaxation employs various techniques, approaches and modes of practice.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) Most involve using repetitive actions (focusing on a word, sound, phrase, muscular activity) and adopting a passive attitude toward intruding thoughts with a return to focus. It has been studied in anxiety, depression, pain and irritable bowel syndrome.​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)

### Rolfing

Rolfing is a manipulation method that uses deep muscle massage to correct distortions in the body.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[36]](#psc1096n1049) It teaches that distortions in posture reflect a withdrawal response to past emotional and physical trauma, and restoring correct posture with manipulation will release the traumas, resulting in a feeling of lightness and well-being.

### Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a Japanese massage technique in which pressure is applied to specific points on the body likened to acupuncture points.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)​[[108]](#psc1096n1095) It may be combined with passive stretching to optimize the effect. It has been likened to acupressure in technique, but is used more for prevention of illness than treatment.

### Tai Chi

Tai chi is a series of precise, focused slow-moving postures accompanied by controlled breathing and a calm, relaxed mind, which involves physical and mental discipline.​[[94]](#psc1096n1089) It is used to unite body and mind and promote balance in life. Limited evidence demonstrates a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate and a reduction in stress. Tai chi may be useful in osteoarthritis of the knee,​[[109]](#psc1096n01198) prevention of falls in the elderly​[[110]](#psc1096n01199) and improving balance in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease.​[[111]](#psc1096n01200)

### Therapeutic Touch

Therapeutic touch is an energy therapy developed in the late 1960s in which providers move their hands above the surface of a patient’s body in an attempt to correct an imbalance in the patient’s energy field and facilitate healing.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)​[[112]](#psc1096n1096) Practitioners believe that their hands can transfer energy from themselves to a patient to achieve energy balance within the patient. It is a popular treatment for pain, anxiety, Alzheimer dementia and stress, though the evidence to support its use is limited; therapeutic touch is also used to improve well-being of cancer patients.​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)

### Traditional Chinese Medicine

TCM, also known as traditional Oriental medicine, is a comprehensive and major medical system dating back to 3000 BC that comprises many traditions, philosophies and approaches to treatment.​[[38]](#psc1096n1046)​[[46]](#psc1096n1051)​[[49]](#psc1096n1054)​[[69]](#psc1096n1072)​[[113]](#psc1096n1097) It is based on fundamental concepts that include a balance between yin and yang (opposing yet complementary phenomena that exist simultaneously throughout the universe and the body) and unimpeded flow of qi (the vital force or energy that circulates through the body in invisible pathways termed meridians). Health problems may reflect a lack of harmony within an individual, or between individuals and their environment, resulting in a blockage in the flow of qi and an imbalance of yin and yang. Diagnosis of the patient involves a multitude of techniques in addition to taking a medical history, which include assessing temperament, examining the tongue and properties of the pulse, and noting qualities of speech and breath. The practitioner evaluates how illness manifests itself in the patient, and then treats the person, not the disease. Treatments are highly individualized, and employ various methods to target the deep cause of the disease rather than only symptoms.​[[69]](#psc1096n1072) Chosen methods of therapy include diet, herbal therapy, acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping and bleeding, tui na, and qigong.

### Traditional Medicine

The WHO defines traditional medicine as “the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.”​[[114]](#psc1096n1098)

### Tui Na

Tui na is a manipulative practice within TCM that involves trained practitioners manipulating soft tissues and joints.​[[37]](#psc1096n1045)​[[50]](#psc1096n1055) Attention is given to the flow of qi along meridians, and acupuncture points are stimulated. It is commonly used in orthopedic and neurological applications, and can be used in situations where acupuncture is considered inappropriate (e.g., pediatrics).

### Yoga

Yoga is one of the top CAM modalities used in North America and is intended to promote relaxation and achieve balance in mind, body and spirit through the use of physical postures, breathing exercises, meditation and a philosophical approach.​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)​[[115]](#psc1096n1099) The numerous schools of yoga incorporate these components in varying proportions.​[[45]](#psc1096n1044)​[[63]](#psc1096n1065)​[[115]](#psc1096n1099) Possible benefits include rejuvenation, awareness, self-realization, stress reduction, increased strength and improved flexibility. It is advocated as a way to increase the mind’s flexibility and resilience when faced with stress. Limited research suggests yoga may help with various conditions including asthma,​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) hypertension,​[[63]](#psc1096n1065) depression,​[[116]](#psc1096n01202) pain​[[117]](#psc1096n01203) and anxiety; it may also improve overall fitness, strength and flexibility.​[[115]](#psc1096n1099) It should be noted that individuals with certain medical conditions (glaucoma, hypertension, severe osteoporosis) could be at risk with some postures.

### Evidence

While there may be evidence to support certain CAM treatments, there is often a gap between published RCTs finding CAM to be of little or no effect, and anecdotal reports of clinical benefit by CAM practitioners and their patients.​[[118]](#psc1096n1019) Pharmacists are well placed to discuss CAM options with patients, especially NHP selection, but many feel ill-equipped to provide reliable information based on sound research.​[[119]](#psc1096n1022)​[[120]](#psc1096n01177) This leads to frustration at the pharmacy, as less than half of patients surveyed thought that their pharmacist provided useful information about complementary therapies.​[[121]](#psc1096n01176) In direct contrast to drug therapy, where research precedes marketing approval, a lack of regulatory oversight in CAM has seen these therapies become embedded and diversified before clinical trials are conducted.​[[24]](#psc1096n1021)​[[118]](#psc1096n1019)​[[119]](#psc1096n1022)​[[122]](#psc1096n1020)​[[123]](#psc1096n1023) For example, an assessment of published RCTs of herbal interventions found quality of the reports to be unsatisfactory, reinforcing the need for adoption of established reporting standards.​[[124]](#psc1096n01179) The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group has developed an Herbal Medicinal Intervention extension to their RCT reporting guidelines, addressing factors such as naming of the products, details of product composition and quality testing.​[[125]](#refitem-1232143-AFBFD0C2) Similar guidelines have been developed for reporting of acupuncture interventions and nonpharmacologic treatment interventions.​[[126]](#refitem-1232143-AFBFBBF4)​[[127]](#refitem-1232144-AFBFBDEC)

Mainstream medicine has historically overlooked, ignored or rejected CAM, citing lack of convincing evidence, flawed methodology and bias in CAM research, but increasing use by patients demands greater understanding by practitioners as well as better-quality research. Many conventional medicine practitioners claim that benefits from CAM treatment are due only to placebo effect; indeed, factors that may be part of CAM such as the degree of individualization, time spent with the practitioner and physical interventions (such as acupuncture) are associated with a stronger placebo response.​[[128]](#refitem-1232145-AFBFBF56)​[[129]](#refitem-1232146-AFBFC14F) For health professionals to adopt any evidence into clinical practice, they must be aware of research results, be able to assess and interpret research findings, then apply the evidence into clinical practice.​[[130]](#psc1096n1024) Because CAM does not have a tradition of reliance on double-blind, randomized, controlled trials that inform modern evidence-based medicine, there are obstacles to this approach, as there are with many nonpharmacologic treatment interventions (see [Table 3](#psc1096n01101)). Application of scientific research findings into clinical practice by both conventional and CAM practitioners can be haphazard and inconsistent.​[[131]](#psc1096n1025) Schools that teach CAM therapies do not have a tradition of research or research infrastructure, so in certain areas of practice (such as TCM), investigators are not familiar enough with clinical trial methodology to perform research that satisfies Western reviewers.

Developing an evidence base for CAM therapies is a well-recognized challenge being addressed internationally. To promote standards of practice in CAM, the WHO has developed training benchmarks to ensure practitioners have adequate knowledge, skills and awareness of appropriate usage and safety in a variety of CAM practices, including TCM, ayurveda, naturopathy, osteopathy and others.​[[132]](#psc1096n01182) Additionally, the Cochrane group involved in CAM distributes guidelines on trial design and reporting standards to CAM practitioners, with a particular focus on TCM.​[[133]](#psc1096n01156) The NCCIH within the National Institutes of Health has invested US$2 billion to support CAM research.​[[130]](#psc1096n1024) Education programs are underway both to educate CAM practitioners on clinical research methodology​[[133]](#psc1096n01156) and to introduce conventional health-care practitioners to CAM in order to promote open dialogue with patients.​[[35]](#psc1096n1028)​[[134]](#psc1096n1027) A recent survey of Canadian-regulated CAM schools (including schools of chiropractic, naturopathy, massage therapy and acupuncture) indicated that research methods and evidence-based health-care training were offered by 81% and 91% of the schools, respectively.​[[135]](#refitem-1232155-AFC4EE99) In addition, suggested core competencies in pharmacy students include the ability to access and critically appraise sources of information related to NHPs and the ability to educate patients on the safety and effectiveness of NHPs.​[[136]](#refitem-1232156-AFC4F571)

Despite the challenges, high-quality RCTs in CAM can be designed​[[137]](#psc1096n1011) and do exist.​[[44]](#psc1096n1010) In Canada, collaborative projects to gather CAM evidence include the [Canadian Institute of Natural and Integrative Medicine](http://www.cinim.org) and internationally, the [International Society for Complementary Medicine Research](http://www.iscmr.org). ISCMR also provides high-quality reviews of CAM therapies and NHPs. Systematic reviews are being used to gather and synthesize evidence and to identify potential areas of research. Cochrane Complementary Medicine is a group dedicated to producing and disseminating systematic reviews of RCTs in numerous CAM areas (acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, homeopathy, herbal medicine, mind-body therapy). Although not without challenges (considering the heterogeneity of CAM therapies), nearly 800 systematic reviews involving CAM were listed in the Cochrane Library in 2015. Cochrane reviews of CAM treatments for specific conditions are made readily available as plain language summaries.​[[138]](#psc1096n1030)

**Table 3:** Challenges with Research Involving CAM

| Locating published evidence:​ [123] ​ [139] ​ [140] ​ [141] Lack of consistent complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) terminology and indexing headings Publication bias in high-impact journals foreign language journal reviewers may be unfamiliar with CAM methods Many CAM journals not being included in conventional databases (PubMed) |
| Methodology and research design issues:​ [44] ​ [96] ​ [118] ​ [122] ​ [123] ​ [133] ​ [142] ​ [143] Heterogeneity of products and practices lack of standardization of biologic products hampers reproducibility individualization of treatment approaches makes effects of treatment difficult to measure Difficulties with blinding, e.g., acupuncture Expectation bias and placebo effect Lack of appropriate animal models for some areas of CAM, such as those involving nonpharmacologic treatment interventions Lack of funding for large CAM trials |

### Summary

Increasing focus on self-care has led patients to exploring CAM therapies as a means of improving their health and well-being. As primary health-care practitioners, pharmacists are at the forefront and are often the most trusted practitioners when it comes to consulting on CAM modalities. Understanding the nature of CAM, the history and terminology, and the potential benefits and limitations will improve the pharmacist-patient relationship and can significantly improve the overall health of the patient. While, in general, there is limited scientific evidence to support the use of CAM modalities to improve disease outcome, there is evidence to suggest that some modalities have utility in improving health quality. It is important for pharmacists to be aware that patients are participating in these practices and to engage patients to better understand the nature of their CAM practices, as open-mindedness will enable a more comprehensive approach to the patient’s overall health.
