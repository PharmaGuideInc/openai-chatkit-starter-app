### Introduction

This chapter discusses primary headache disorders in children and adolescents (tension-type headache and migraine) as well as a common secondary headache disorder (medication-overuse headache). Other primary (e.g., trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, new daily persistent headache, primary stabbing headache) and secondary (e.g., trauma, substance related, infection) headache disorders, status migrainosus and inpatient management are outside of the scope of this chapter.

Headache occurs commonly in children and adolescents. Globally, headache is the second most disabling condition in adolescents.​[[1]](#GBD2019DiseasesAndInjuriesCollabora) The prevalence of headache in children and adolescents is approximately 60%.​[[2]](#Abu-ArafehIRazakSSivaramanBEtAl.Pre-AB9180F4)

- Among the primary headache disorders, tension-type headache is the most common, affecting approximately 17% of school-aged children and adolescents globally.​[[3]](#OnofriAPensatoURosignoli) This is followed by migraine, affecting approximately 11%. Of those with migraine, 8% have migraine without aura and 3% have migraine with aura.
- The prevalence of migraine increases with age; the overall prevalence in children and adolescents in Canada is 5.1% (2.9% from 5–9 years of age and 9% from 10–19 years of age).​[[4]](#GlobalBurdenOfDiseasePediatricColla-AB92DB45) Migraine is a significant cause of disability in adolescents; therefore, it is important to manage it appropriately.

### Goals of Therapy

- Make an accurate diagnosis of headache​[[5]](#c0010n00348)
- Relieve or abort pain and associated symptoms
- Prevent medication overuse
- Develop adaptive pain-coping strategies​[[6]](#OrrSLKabboucheMAOx2019BrienHLEtAl.P-E84B4CEC)
- Decrease headache disability and absenteeism
- Prevent disease progression​[[6]](#OrrSLKabboucheMAOx2019BrienHLEtAl.P-E84B4CEC)
- Improve health-related quality of life​[[6]](#OrrSLKabboucheMAOx2019BrienHLEtAl.P-E84B4CEC)

### Investigations

- [Figure 1](#c0010n00992) illustrates the process for evaluating headache in children and adolescents.
- History is key to the diagnosis of headache and should be obtained from both parent and child. Focus on the child’s report and rely on parents and family members for clarification and supporting details. Recommend the child and family members keep a detailed headache diary to identify triggers, headache pattern and response to treatment.​[[7]](#HeadachesInOver12s) While taking the history, focus on the questions outlined in [Table 1](#table-1102123-C3A41250).

- Physical examination:

  - BP, vital signs, palpation of sinuses, examination of teeth, neck stiffness, carotid and cranial bruits
  - height, weight, head circumference
  - thorough neurologic examination including cranial nerve exam with fundoscopy, power testing including pronator drift, reflex exam, Babinski testing, tandem gait evaluation and coordination testing

- Investigations:

  - the routine use of any diagnostic study is not indicated when the clinical history has no associated risk factors and the child’s examination is normal; obtaining a neuroimaging study (CT or MRI) on a routine basis is not indicated in children with recurrent headache and a normal neurologic examination​[[8]](#c0010n00033)
  - consider doing neuroimaging studies in the presence of the following red flags​[[8]](#c0010n00033) (see also [Figure 1](#c0010n00992)):

    - abnormal neurologic exam: focal findings, increased intracranial pressure, motor deficits, altered level of consciousness, seizures
    - recent onset of severe headache, change in type of headache, neurologic dysfunction, systemic signs/symptoms
  - lumbar puncture is indicated if an infectious or inflammatory process is suspected or to measure opening pressure (if possibility of idiopathic intracranial hypertension); if increased intracranial pressure is suspected, lumbar puncture is done only if there is no contraindication identified during neuroimaging studies (MRI; may add vessel imaging if there is a suspicion of aneurysm [MRA] or thrombosis [MRV] and contrast if there is suspicion of low pressure headache due to cerebrospinal fluid leak)​[[9]](#KacperskiJKabboucheMAOBrienHLetAl.T-AB9F09C4)

**Table 1:** History of Headache

| Red flags | See Figure 1 ; the presence of a red flag warrants referral to a pediatrician and/or neurologist if laboratory/radiologic findings are abnormal. Symptoms suggestive of renal, cardiac, dental or infectious disease also warrant referral |
| Headache-specific | Pain onset, progression, quality, duration, frequency, location, as well as relieving and aggravating factors such as physical activity or positional changes |
| Triggers | Skipping meals, sleep loss/excess, dehydration, caffeine, exercise, relation to menstruation, weather, anxiety/stress |
| Associated symptoms | Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, movement sensitivity |
| Conditions occurring in migraine patients | Motion sickness, sleepwalking, sleep talking or bruxism (grinding/clenching of teeth), growing pains, cold-stimulus headache, others |
| Development | Growth curve, academic function and behaviour, developmental delays, learning disabilities |
| Psychiatric comorbidities | Screen for psychiatric comorbidities; the incidence of mood disorders, including adverse childhood experiences, suicidal ideations, anxiety and depression are higher in children and adolescents with migraine​ [10] ​ [11] ​ [12] |
| Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine | Previously named childhood periodic syndromes or migraine variants, e.g., benign paroxysmal torticollis, benign paroxysmal vertigo, recurrent gastrointestinal disturbance (abdominal migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome), infantile colic, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, vestibular migraine​ [13] |
| Family history | The presence of an aura, in particular, tends to be familial; also review family history of early strokes, clotting or bleeding disorders including history of frequent miscarriages, intracranial aneurysms or neoplasia |
| Medications | Nonprescription and prescription medication use (including frequency of use). Adolescents should be confidentially screened for drug use, including cannabis |
| Disability | The degree of interference with school and social life via the PedMIDAS tool​ [14] |

### Tension-Type Headache

### Investigations

Tension-type headache is a primary headache disorder previously known as stress headache, ordinary headache or psychogenic headache. Prominent features of this form of headache include duration of 30 minutes to 7 days with pain that is mild to moderate, bilateral and pressing/nonpulsing. Diagnostic criteria of tension-type headache can be found in [Figure 1](#c0010n00992).

Tension-type headache can be episodic or chronic:​[[15]](#HeadacheClassificationCommitteeOfTh-AB9F316B)

- Episodic:

  - infrequent: <1 day per month; <12 days per year
  - frequent: 1–14 days per month; ≥12 to <180 days per year
- Chronic: ≥15 days per month; ≥180 days per year

Episodic tension-type headache is self-limiting; the episode will typically resolve spontaneously even without treatment. Children and their parents often consult their primary care provider when headaches become more frequent and are no longer responsive to analgesics.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

For the treatment of tension-type headache in children and adolescents, adaptive pain-coping strategies are the mainstay of therapy. The nonpharmacologic options with the most evidence are:​[[16]](#FaeddaNCeruttiRVerdecchiaPEtAl.Beha-ABA7D15B)

- Cognitive behavioural therapy
- Relaxation training
- Biofeedback
- Mindfulness​[[17]](#RastogiRGArnoldTLBorrero-MejiasCEtA-D8AFF6A1)​[[18]](#GrazziLGrignaniERaggiAEtAl.EffectOf-D8B03DCD)

### Pharmacologic Choices

- Acetaminophen and NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) are effective for the treatment of acute tension-type headache (see [Table 2](#c0010n00029)).​[[19]](#c0010n00194) ASA should be avoided in children and adolescents (<15 years of age) given the risk of Reye syndrome.​[[20]](#StarkoKMRayCGDominiquezLBEtAl.Reyes-C4E0D949)​[[21]](#WaldmanRJHallWNMcGeeHEtAl.AspirinAs-C4E0DAD0)
- Amitriptyline and nortriptyline (see [Table 3](#c0010n00031)) are effective in reducing headache frequency and severity.​[[22]](#c0010n00195)​[[23]](#c0010n00352) Other options include venlafaxine or mirtazapine. SSRIs, in general, have poor efficacy for tension-type headache. Preventive therapy may be appropriate when headaches are frequent (>4 times per month) and/or significantly affecting daily function or school attendance/performance.​[[24]](#JensenRH.Tension-typeHeadache-TheNo-B1248707)

. . . . .

### Migraine

### Investigations

Migraine is a genetic and complex sensory processing brain disorder mediated by various neuropeptides, including calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP).​[[25]](#GoadsbyPJHollandPRMartins-OliveiraM-B1276616) The diagnostic criteria of migraine headache can be found in [Figure 1](#c0010n00992). Prominent features of this form of headache in children and adolescents include pain that is moderate to severe, often bilateral until late adolescence, throbbing (can also present as nonthrobbing), frontotemporal and aggravated by activity. The headache duration is typically 2–72 hours and photophobia and phonophobia, nausea, and/or vomiting are often present. In children, migraine typically has a faster onset and offset, is of shorter duration (as short as 2 hours), and presents with more GI symptoms compared to migraine in adults.​[[15]](#HeadacheClassificationCommitteeOfTh-AB9F316B)

The majority of children with migraine have migraine without aura.​[[26]](#VictorTWHuXCampbellJCEtAl.MigraineP-B12BDB2D) Migraine aura is a symptom that typically occurs prior to the onset of headache but may occur during a headache attack. The most common type of aura is visual (scintillations, scotoma), followed by sensory (numbness, tingling) and speech.​[[15]](#HeadacheClassificationCommitteeOfTh-AB9F316B)

If it is challenging to get an accurate history from children, attempt to infer the associated features of migraine from the patient’s behaviour as well as identify any symptoms associated with “episodic syndromes” of migraine (see [Table 1](#table-1102123-C3A41250)). Resting in a dark and quiet room, for example, can suggest photophobia and phonophobia.

In 50–75% of cases, a patient with migraine will have a first-degree relative with a history of migraine; thus, asking about family history is important.​[[13]](#Lagman-BatolomeAMLayC.PediatricMigr-AB942913)​[[27]](#GelfandA.EpisodicSyndromesThatMayBe-AB9996F2)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

In children and adolescents with migraine headache, adaptive pain-coping strategies are the mainstay of therapy. The following nonpharmacologic options should be utilized:​[[16]](#FaeddaNCeruttiRVerdecchiaPEtAl.Beha-ABA7D15B)

- Provide reassurance, information and education about the headache condition.
- Discuss triggers (“activating factors”) for migraine, e.g., lack of or too much sleep, excitement, specific foods, skipping meals/hunger, dehydration, caffeine use/withdrawal, stress/stress let-down, menstruation.
- Lifestyle modification strategies: optimize sleep hygiene (regular sleeping and waking time; avoid napping); employ stress management strategies; maintain adequate hydration; perform regular exercise; consume a protein-rich meal within 30 minutes to 1 hour of waking; avoid skipping meals, as low blood sugar can trigger migraine.
- Promote cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),​[[28]](#NgQXVenkatanarayananNKumarL.ASystem-ABA7AE9C)​[[29]](#ErnstMMOBrienHLPowersSW.Cognitive-b-C85BFD32) mindfulness, biofeedback and relaxation therapy, which are effective tools.​[[16]](#FaeddaNCeruttiRVerdecchiaPEtAl.Beha-ABA7D15B) CBT as a preventive therapy for migraine has been supported in a pivotal clinical trial when used in combination with amitriptyline,​[[30]](#PowersSWKashikar-ZuckSMAllenJREtAl.-B139C929) a subsequent meta-analysis​[[28]](#NgQXVenkatanarayananNKumarL.ASystem-ABA7AE9C) and by pediatric guidelines.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)
- Noninvasive neurostimulation devices that manipulate the vagus nerve, supraorbital nerve and transcranial magnetic field are all used in pediatrics. Transmagnetic stimulation (TMS), remote electrical nerve stimulation (REN) and noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) are approved by the FDA for use in adolescents with migraine; only nVNS is approved by Health Canada for migraine treatment in adolescents. They may offer some benefit, although cost is the prohibitive factor.​[[32]](#MillerSSinclairAJDaviesBEtAl.Neuros-B1306680)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Medication therapy for pediatric migraine can be divided into medication given at the time of the headache (acute or rescue therapy)​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6) and medication taken regularly to decrease the frequency, duration and intensity of headache (preventive).​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)

### Acute or Rescue Therapy

Medications used to treat migraine symptoms in children are listed in [Table 2](#c0010n00029).

The goals for acute treatment of migraine symptoms in children and adolescents include:

- Eliminate migraine symptoms quickly and effectively
- Minimize the use of rescue medications
- Restore the patient’s ability to function
- Minimize the adverse effects of medications
- Provide cost-effective management of migraine
- Optimize self-care to minimize physician and hospital visits

### Analgesics

Intermittent oral analgesics, given as early in the course of the headache as feasible, are the mainstay of pharmacologic management of childhood migraine.​[[9]](#KacperskiJKabboucheMAOBrienHLetAl.T-AB9F09C4)​[[19]](#c0010n00194)​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6)​[[34]](#c0010n00183)​[[35]](#c0010n00349) Ibuprofen  has stronger evidence than acetaminophen and is recommended by guidelines for the acute treatment of migraine.​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6) ASA should be avoided in children and adolescents (<15 years of age) given risk of Reye syndrome.​[[20]](#StarkoKMRayCGDominiquezLBEtAl.Reyes-C4E0D949)​[[21]](#WaldmanRJHallWNMcGeeHEtAl.AspirinAs-C4E0DAD0) Based on clinical experience, longer-acting NSAIDs such as naproxen may be less likely to cause rebound headache.​[[37]](#GelfandAAGoadsbyPJ.MedicationOverus-ABA67291)

Combination products containing ASA, caffeine and butalbital ± codeine (e.g., Fiorinal) should be avoided as they can potentially cause rebound headache in patients with migraine. Furthermore, since these products contain ASA, they should also be avoided due to the potential link with Reye syndrome.​[[20]](#StarkoKMRayCGDominiquezLBEtAl.Reyes-C4E0D949)​[[21]](#WaldmanRJHallWNMcGeeHEtAl.AspirinAs-C4E0DAD0) Opioid analgesics are not recommended due to lack of evidence for efficacy and great potential for overuse/abuse.​[[36]](#FriedmanBWIrizarryESolorzanoCEtAl.R-E84DDF9D)

### Antiemetics

Nausea and vomiting occur in up to 90% of young migraine sufferers and, in addition to being disabling, can inhibit oral administration of analgesics. Antiemetics alone (e.g., metoclopramide or prochlorperazine)​[[37]](#GelfandAAGoadsbyPJ.MedicationOverus-ABA67291) are surprisingly effective in relieving all symptoms, including the headache.​[[38]](#PatniyotIRGelfandAA.AcuteTreatmentT-C85ECF7E) Since the antiemetics are dopamine blockers, and are associated with an increased risk of akathisia and other extrapyramidal symptoms, they are occasionally coadministered with diphenhydramine to mitigate such risk.​[[39]](#HealthCanada.RecallsAndSafetyAlerts-E850E3F1)​[[40]](#VinsonDRDrottsDL.DiphenhydramineFor-E8514187)

A nonsedating option for nausea is ondansetron.​[[41]](#BenaryDLozanoJMHigleyREtAl) Alternative therapies with limited evidence include ginger chews, aromatherapy (e.g., mint, lavender), inhaled isopropyl alcohol​[[42]](#AprilMDOliverJJDavisWTEtAl.Aromathe-B132678E) or neuromodulatory wrist devices (e.g., Reliefband).

### Triptans

Consider triptans for use in children and adolescents with frequent, disabling, moderate to severe migraine attacks.​[[43]](#c0010n00355)​[[44]](#c0010n00356)​[[45]](#c0010n00365)​[[46]](#HoTWPearlmanELewisDEtAl.EfficacyAnd-C8F4DCAC)​[[47]](#LinderSLMathewNTCadyRKEtAl.xa0Effic-C8F52540)​[[48]](#AhonenKHamalainenMLEerolaMEtAl.ARan-C8F59E3B) Seven agents (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan) are available in Canada (see [Table 2](#c0010n00029)). Only almotriptan is Health Canada–approved for use in adolescents ≥12 years of age; no triptans are Health Canada–approved for use in children <12 years of age. Several triptans have been shown to be safe and effective in adolescents and children.​[[43]](#c0010n00355)​[[44]](#c0010n00356)​[[45]](#c0010n00365) The best evidence exists for the use of oral almotriptan,​[[47]](#LinderSLMathewNTCadyRKEtAl.xa0Effic-C8F52540) nasal zolmitriptan or sumatriptan in adolescents,​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6)​[[49]](#c0010n00357)​[[50]](#c0010n00358)​[[51]](#c0010n00199) and rizatriptan oral disintegrating tablet in children as young as 6 years of age.​[[46]](#HoTWPearlmanELewisDEtAl.EfficacyAnd-C8F4DCAC)​[[52]](#WinnerPLewisDVisserWHEtAl.Rizatript-B6635370)

Some studies have shown greater efficacy of triptans when used in combination with naproxen for acute headache relief, particularly the combination of oral sumatriptan and naproxen in adolescents.​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6) This combination can be considered when monotherapy with triptans is ineffective.​[[53]](#SyedYY.SumatriptanNaproxenSodiumARe-ABAA08E5) There is inadequate data on the efficacy of subcutaneous sumatriptan in this age group.

Triptans are generally well tolerated; unpleasant taste is a common side effect. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, severe peripheral vascular disease, ischemic bowel disease and cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6)

### Small Molecule CGRP Receptor Antagonists (Gepants)

Ubrogepant, a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist indicated for the acute treatment of migraine, became available in Canada in 2023. Rimegepant, which has indications for both the acute and preventative treatment of migraine, is available in Canada in 2024. These medications are not yet approved for use in the pediatric population; however, studies are ongoing.​[[54]](#NIHU.S.LibraryOfMedicine.Rimegepant)​[[55]](#NIHU.S.LibraryOfMedicine.Long-term_Ubrogepant)

### Ergot Derivatives

Ergot derivatives have very limited use in pediatrics for the following reasons:

- There is limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of oral dihydroergotamine (DHE) for acute migraine treatment in children.​[[56]](#RicherLBillinghurstLLinsdellMAEtAl.-ABA9CE2A)​[[57]](#HamalainenMLHoppuKSantavuoriPRAl.Or-B1352970)
- Ergots can exacerbate GI upset during a migraine headache.
- Ergots are contraindicated in complicated migraine syndromes (basilar, hemiplegic migraine) because of the risk of increasing vasospasm.
- Nasal DHE has limited systemic absorption and efficacy. Treatment is complicated by the need for concurrent antiemetic treatment and the contraindication in patients exposed to triptans within 24 hours. Nasal DHE is considered only in patients tolerant to but not responsive to triptan therapy.

### Alternative Therapy

Intranasal 2% lidocaine successfully treated migraine attacks in 6 of 17 participants in a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study in patients 7-16 years of age.​[[58]](#MakiKDoanQSihKEtAl) This medication is an off-label treatment that can be considered for acute migraine treatment, especially in young patients who cannot tolerate oral medications or who are vomiting.

### Preventive Therapy

Medications used to prevent migraine in children are listed in [Table 3](#c0010n00031). Although there are relatively few trials supporting the use of preventive agents in migraine for this population, a medication may still be effective for a particular individual. Thus, preventive agents should be considered, especially in children and adolescents who have frequent and disabling migraine attacks and/or a migraine-related disability, as well as in those overusing medications. In clinical practice, preventive treatments are offered if a child reports ≥6 headaches of any severity per month or 3–4 severe headaches per month.

Slow titration over a period of 4–12 weeks to the lowest effective dose is common in order to avoid side effects. It is essential to discuss with the patient and/or caregiver(s) that the response to the medications is not rapid; a response may typically occur within 2–3 months once a therapeutic dose has been achieved. Comorbid conditions, including depression and anxiety, asthma, renal disorder/stones, arrhythmia and obesity, should also be considered when selecting the preventive agent.​[[9]](#KacperskiJKabboucheMAOBrienHLetAl.T-AB9F09C4)

The goals of therapy for preventative treatment of migraine symptoms in children and adolescents include:​[[33]](#OskouiMPringsheimTHoller-ManaganYEt-B131D4A6)

- Achieve >50% reduction in attack frequency, severity and duration
- Improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attack
- Improve function and quality of life; reduce disability

Evidence for nutraceuticals for pediatric migraine prevention is of low quality. Magnesium and coenzyme Q10 have shown promise and may be effective for migraine prevention in children and adolescents.​[[59]](#OrrSLVenkateswaranS.NutraceuticalsI-ABAA305A)​[[60]](#OrrSL.DietAndNutraceuticalInterven)​[[61]](#OrrSL.TheEvidenceForTheRoleOfNutrac) Although the evidence is minimal, riboflavin​[[62]](#c0010n00353) and melatonin​[[63]](#FallahRShorokiFFFerdosianF.SafetyAn-B19B939C) may also be considered. These nutraceuticals, despite low-quality evidence for efficacy, are often favoured as first-line options in pediatrics due to a favourable benefit-risk ratio.

An examination of the evidence for efficacy of several medications commonly used for preventive treatment of childhood migraine found that, although many medications are currently in use and may be effective, only propranolol, topiramate and amitriptyline (with concurrent CBT) demonstrated sufficient evidence for recommendation in guidelines.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)

Evidence for propranolol showed >50% reduction in headache frequency compared to placebo; it is commonly used in clinical practice and is effective in some cases.​[[64]](#c0010n00039) Propranolol is contraindicated in reactive airway disease, diabetes mellitus and bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms of depression are an under-reported but common side effect in adolescents.

Topiramate is approved for migraine prevention in adults. It is sometimes used off-label in adolescents​[[23]](#c0010n00352)​[[65]](#c0010n00225)​[[66]](#c0010n00351) and is approved for this population in the United States. Adverse effects, including its teratogenic potential, typically limit use. If topiramate is considered for migraine prevention in patients of childbearing potential, there should be a discussion about both its potential teratogenic effects and interaction with oral combined hormonal contraceptives resulting in possible decreased efficacy of the latter.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)

Amitriptyline has shown efficacy, especially when combined with CBT in children.​[[23]](#c0010n00352)​[[30]](#PowersSWKashikar-ZuckSMAllenJREtAl.-B139C929)​[[67]](#c0010n00042) In pediatric migraine prevention guidelines, amitriptyline combined with CBT received the highest confidence recommendation; nevertheless, patients and parents should be informed of potential adverse effects of amitriptyline, including increased risk of suicide.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)

A trial comparing the efficacy of topiramate, amitriptyline and placebo in pediatric migraine prevention for children 8–17 years of age concluded that, considering the adverse events reported in the intervention groups, the data did not show any favourable risk-benefit for the use of these medications in this population.​[[68]](#PowersSWmCoffeyCSChamberlinLAEtAl.T-B13866CE) A discussion with patients and their families on high placebo effect in migraine treatment in children is recommended. However, as previously noted, the use of preventive medications should be considered when headache causes functional disability and has an impact on the child’s daily activities and school attendance.

Despite a lack of evidence of efficacy, cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with antiserotonergic and calcium channel blocking properties, is widely used as a preventive agent in young children.​[[69]](#TekinHEdemP.EffectsAndSideEffectsOf-D8B256D5) Its use in older children and adolescents is limited by sedation and increased appetite/weight gain. Although strong evidence of their efficacy is lacking, pizotifen (pizotyline) and flunarizine may be helpful.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)​[[70]](#LocherCKossowskyJKoechlinHEtAl.Effi-E85A7B96)​[[71]](#c0010n00040)​[[72]](#c0010n00041)

A prospective placebo-controlled trial investigating onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for migraine prevention in adolescents did not demonstrate efficacy, but may have been underpowered to detect a meaningful clinical benefit.​[[73]](#WinnerPKKabboucheMYonkerMEtAl.ARand-FDD51318) A more recent placebo-controlled trial showed a significant decrease in headache frequency, intensity and disability in pediatric migraine patients.​[[74]](#ShahSCalderonMDCrainNEtAl) Moreover, retrospective studies of Botox suggest efficacy and safety in the adolescent population.​[[75]](#ShahSCalderonMDWuWEtAl.Onabotulinum-BD7827C2)​[[76]](#AliSSBraginIRendeEEtAl.FurtherEvide-BD785BA0)

Other considerations for preventive therapy extrapolated from the adult literature include venlafaxine, levetiracetam, candesartan and memantine (typically more useful in those with aura). Valproic acid has been studied in children; however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use, and adverse effects limit its usefulness.​[[31]](#OskouiMPringsheimTBillinhurstLEtAl.-B12F7039)​[[77]](#c0010n00043)​[[78]](#c0010n00350)

CGRP receptor antagonists, which include erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab and eptinezumab are available in Canada. They are not yet indicated for the pediatric population, but several studies are underway. They may be considered in those with refractory headache disorder who have failed ≥2 prior preventive treatments, are of postpubescent age and have no other medical comorbidities.​[[79]](#SzperkaCLVanderPluymJOrrSLEtAl.Reco-B1A39FC4) For selected patients started on these medications, careful monitoring for bone health, linear growth, BMI, infections and BP elevation is recommended.

Atogepant, a small molecule oral CGRP receptor antagonist, was approved in Canada in 2023 for the prevention of episodic migraine in adults. A clinical trial for use in the pediatric population is currently underway.​[[80]](#NIHU.S.Atogepant) Rimegepant, which was approved in Canada in 2024, has ongoing trials assessing utility for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents.​[[81]](#NIRimegpantPrev) Neither are currently indicated for use in the pediatric population.

Nerve blocks are frequently used in pediatrics, often as bridge therapy, to treat severe headache refractory to acute medications or short-term preventive therapy.​[[82]](#SzperkaCLGelfandAAHersheyAD.Pattern-B130841C)

CBT is an important therapeutic option for migraine prevention; see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0010n00013) for more information.

### Medication-Overuse Headache

### Investigations

Medication-overuse headache (MOH), also known as rebound headache, is a secondary headache disorder that is defined as the occurrence of headache induced by the chronic use of analgesics, such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, individuals with a pre-existing headache disorder (especially migraine) appear to be predisposed to developing MOH. Diagnostic criteria for MOH can be found in [Figure 1](#c0010n00992).

The main feature of MOH is ≥15 headache days per month in patients who have had >3 months of excessive use of abortive medications (≥10 days per month of triptan, ergot or opioid use *or* ≥15 days per month of nonprescription analgesic, anti-inflammatory or combination analgesic product use).​[[15]](#HeadacheClassificationCommitteeOfTh-AB9F316B)

Complications associated with MOH include:​[[37]](#GelfandAAGoadsbyPJ.MedicationOverus-ABA67291)

- Increased headache frequency, e.g., episodic headaches can become chronic if abortive medications are used excessively
- Central nervous system side effects (sedation) and/or dependence/tolerance if using opioids or barbiturates
- Reduced efficacy of preventive or abortive medications, e.g., opioids can reduce the effectiveness of triptans

In order to mitigate the risk of developing MOH, it is important to inquire and educate pediatric patients and caregivers regarding the use of acute medications.

### Therapeutic Choices

Treatment of MOH involves education and gradual withdrawal of analgesic drugs. During this withdrawal phase, prescribers may consider changing the currently used medication to a long-acting alternative such as naproxen BID for 4–7 days (up to 2 weeks)​[[37]](#GelfandAAGoadsbyPJ.MedicationOverus-ABA67291)​[[83]](#CadyRNettRDexterKEtAl.TreatmentOfCh-ABA787DD) and may also initiate a preventive agent (see [Table 3](#c0010n00031)).​[[84]](#MathewNTKurmanRPerezF.DrugInducedRe-C6D92AA1)

. . . . .

### Therapeutic Tips

- Although the prognosis for children with migraine is favourable with early intervention, the majority of children and adolescents with migraine will experience recurrent headaches with 50% of patients reporting persistence of migraine into middle age.​[[85]](#MonasteroRCamardaCPipiaCEtAl.Progno-BD79E6E8)​[[86]](#DooleyJMAugustineHFBrnaPMEtAl.ThePr-BD79E888)
- Headache diaries are helpful in identifying triggers, headache patterns, frequency and severity, and are invaluable for management and evaluation of response to therapy.
- Consider avoidance of specific triggers or activating factors if these are identified. Lifestyle modification strategies may also help reduce the functional impact of migraine for some patients (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0010n00013)).
- Encourage taking medication early in the course of the headache (i.e., within 30–60 minutes of headache onset).
- Children who are debilitated by nausea and vomiting benefit greatly from antiemetics.
- Consider preventive agents if migraine is disrupting school, occurring frequently (>6 days per month of any severity; >3 days per month if severe) and/or leading to moderate to severe disability as measured by the [PedMIDAS](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/h/headache-center/pedmidas) tool​[[14]](#c0010n00034)
- For prevention, consider nutraceuticals (e.g., magnesium, coenzyme Q10) as first-line options;​[[59]](#OrrSLVenkateswaranS.NutraceuticalsI-ABAA305A)​[[60]](#OrrSL.DietAndNutraceuticalInterven)​[[61]](#OrrSL.TheEvidenceForTheRoleOfNutrac) ensure that the products are from reputable manufacturers that follow good manufacturing practices (Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP] certified).
- A reasonable predefined treatment goal would be ≤3 headaches per month for at least 6–12 months.​[[88]](#PowersSWCoffeyCSChamberlinLAEt8)
- Once this lower headache frequency is achieved and sustained, a slow taper and possible discontinuation of the preventative medication may be attempted.​[[9]](#KacperskiJKabboucheMAOBrienHLetAl.T-AB9F09C4) Pediatric patients who experience headache relief from preventative medication may experience sustained, clinically meaningful improvement even after the medication has been discontinued.
