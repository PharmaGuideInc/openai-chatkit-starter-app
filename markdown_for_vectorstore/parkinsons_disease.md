### Introduction

Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Cardinal features are resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. Nonmotor features such as cognitive impairment, depression, psychosis and autonomic dysfunction (excessive sweating, bladder frequency/urgency, orthostatic hypotension) often become the more disabling features as the disease progresses. Treatment significantly decreases morbidity and mortality; however, no treatment to date has been definitively shown to impact the underlying disease process.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Medications providing the most benefit are directed at replenishing dopamine within the brain.

### Goals of Therapy

- Improve functioning and quality of life
- Minimize acute and long-term side effects of medications
- Instill a positive outlook, despite the chronic, progressive nature of PD

### Investigations

- The clinical diagnosis of PD can be made with confidence if the classic features of a unilateral or asymmetric resting tremor plus bradykinesia and rigidity are present. The patient’s earliest complaints may include fatigue, loss of smell, constipation, REM sleep behaviour disorder, general slowness, poor handwriting and a tremulous feeling in one arm, without obvious tremor.
- [The Movement Disorder Society clinical diagnostic criteria for PD](https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/Joseph/publications/Methodological/Postuma2016.pdf) may be used to help with diagnosis.​[[2]](#PostumaRBBergDSternMEtAl.MDSClinica-1A8DDB11)
- Early postural instability, significant autonomic dysfunction, impaired eye movements, rapid progression and poor response to dopaminergic therapy are *not* features of early PD and, if present, suggest a different diagnosis.
- The presence of dementia, even if early in the course of the disease, is no longer an exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of PD.
- Perform imaging studies in young patients or those with atypical features. Exclude Wilson disease in young patients by performing a serum ceruloplasmin, a slit-lamp examination and a 24-hour urine for copper.
- Exclude drug-induced parkinsonism. The most common drug causes include first- and second-generation antipsychotic agents and central dopamine-blocking antiemetics, e.g., metoclopramide and prochlorperazine.
- Patients initially considered to have a possible diagnosis of Parkinson disease may benefit from a trial of at least 1 month of properly dosed dopamine replacement therapy to assist with an accurate diagnosis.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Note, levodopa may take many weeks to reach full efficacy at the final titrated dose.​[[3]](#FrequinHLSchoutenJVerschuurCVMEtAlL-1A94C2BE) For dosing information, see [Table 2](#c0015n00018).

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The nonpharmacologic options listed below may be particularly beneficial for patients in the early phase of PD.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)

- Provide patient education via books, websites, and local and national Parkinson societies (all available through [Parkinson Canada](http://www.parkinson.ca/)).
- Stress the importance of staying active and having a regular exercise routine, which can reduce the rate of falls, reduce severity of symptoms and improve quality of life.​[[4]](#AllenNECanningCGAlmeidaLRSEtAl.Inte-1A8EF4F0)​[[5]](#ErnstMFolkertsAKGollanREtAl.Physica-1A8F0490) To improve motor and nonmotor symptoms, the exercise program should include aerobic, strength, balance and gait training, e.g., dance, tai chi, yoga.​[[6]](#refitem-1152121-06335814)​[[7]](#refitem-1152122-0633B900)​[[8]](#refitem-1152123-06343173)​[[9]](#refitem-1152124-063477BE)​[[10]](#KwokJYYKwanJCYAuyeungMEtAlEffectsO-B402318C)
- Encourage awareness of the important roles of health professionals such as nutritional, speech, physical and occupational therapists,​[[11]](#refitem-1152126-06360333) and home care as the disease becomes more advanced.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Some patients may benefit from surgery; see [Surgery](#c0015n00142).

### Surgery

Recognition that there is a limit to the medical management of PD has brought about a resurgence of surgical treatments. Two main surgical procedures have been shown to be effective in improving motor symptoms: **lesioning procedures** and **deep brain stimulation (DBS)**. Surgical treatment of PD mainly targets the thalamus (improves tremor), globus pallidus (improves dyskinesia and bradykinesia) and the subthalamic nucleus (improves bradykinesia, tremor and dyskinesia).​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Lesioning procedures such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy are performed rarely. DBS is the surgical treatment of choice typically in patients younger than 70 years of age with more advanced disease in whom medications can no longer control motor symptoms.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) It is important for patients to understand that these surgeries are not a cure; functioning will increase only to the level of their best “on” times, and postural instability often does not improve. Poor cognition is a contraindication to these procedures.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapy based on disease progression is described in [Table 1](#c0015n20014) and additional details on the therapeutic agents available are listed in [Table 2](#c0015n00018). An algorithm in [Figure 1](#c0015n00007) provides a guide to the initial management of PD.

### Levodopa

Levodopa is converted to dopamine within presynaptic dopaminergic neurons. It is also converted to dopamine peripherally; however, peripheral dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and is ineffective for the treatment of PD. Although used alone when first discovered, levodopa is now combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide) to inhibit peripheral transformation to dopamine, thus enhancing distribution to the brain, reducing the amount of levodopa required for optimal therapeutic benefit and minimizing acute side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Levodopa may be used as a symptomatic treatment for people with early Parkinson disease, including those with a younger age of onset.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Levodopa remains the most effective medication for the treatment of motor symptoms and there is no reason to delay its use for those with bothersome motor symptoms.​[[3]](#FrequinHLSchoutenJVerschuurCVMEtAlL-1A94C2BE)​[[12]](#PringsheimTDayGSSmithDBEtAl.Dopamin-1A954492) Note, levodopa may take many weeks to reach full efficacy at the final titrated dose.​[[3]](#FrequinHLSchoutenJVerschuurCVMEtAlL-1A94C2BE) For dosing information, see [Table 2](#c0015n00018).

There is theoretical concern that levodopa could be toxic to already damaged dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism involving excess oxidative stress.​[[13]](#c0015n00021) There is little evidence for this from in vitro studies, in vivo animal models or human studies.​[[14]](#c0015n00022)​[[15]](#VerschuurCVMSuwijnSRBoelJAEtAlRand-2BB9D825)

Over time, many PD patients develop symptoms such as dysarthria, gait disorders, postural instability and cognitive dysfunction that are poorly responsive to levodopa therapy. The cause is mainly disease-related degeneration of nondopaminergic neuronal systems; it is not that levodopa has become ineffective for the initial symptoms for which it was started.​[[13]](#c0015n00021)​[[14]](#c0015n00022)

Though initially effective, in many patients, levodopa therapy is eventually complicated by motor fluctuations and dyskinesia; these complications develop in up to 50% of patients after 5 years.​[[16]](#c0015n00023)​[[17]](#c0015n00024) In the early stages of PD, patients enjoy a long-lasting response following a single dose of levodopa. With disease progression and longer-term treatment, patients begin to experience motor fluctuations, such as end-of-dose “wearing off” of effectiveness or periods of fluctuating response known as “on-off” phenomena and a variety of patterns of dyskinesia such as peak-dose dyskinesia (occurring during the peak effect of the dose), diphasic dyskinesia (occurring at the beginning and/or end of a dosing interval) and off-period dystonia (painful spasms, usually of the feet, occurring upon morning rising or when a dose is wearing off). There is also increasing recognition that nonmotor symptoms such as excessive perspiration, anxiety, cognitive changes and shortness of breath do occur and can fluctuate with the motor features of the disease.

The pathophysiology of motor complications is not completely understood, but the leading theory suggests they are related to pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors resulting from intermittent dosing and levodopa’s short plasma half-life.​[[17]](#c0015n00024) The main factors shown to increase the risk of levodopa-induced dyskinesia include higher doses of levodopa, the severity of the underlying nigral degeneration, a younger age at disease onset, lower body weight and female sex.​[[12]](#PringsheimTDayGSSmithDBEtAl.Dopamin-1A954492)​[[17]](#c0015n00024)

Slow-release preparations of levodopa benefit patients having difficulty with wearing off, although good randomized trials are lacking;​[[18]](#c0015n00025) there is no evidence that initiating treatment with controlled-release levodopa provides an advantage over immediate-release formulations.​[[19]](#c0015n00026) Other strategies to minimize pulsatile stimulation of dopamine, such as combining levodopa with a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, have not delayed onset of motor fluctuations and may actually increase the risk of dyskinesia.​[[20]](#c0015n00170)

For individuals whose motor fluctuations are not controlled with oral/transdermal medications, intrajejunal levodopa/carbidopa infusion therapy is now available in Canada. This gel formulation is supplied in cartridges and administered through a percutaneous gastrostomy connected to a wearable external pump. The patient’s levodopa levels are thus more stable throughout the day, which reduces motor fluctuations.​[[21]](#OlanowCWKieburtzKOdinPEtAlDouble-B-B404DE24) A continuous subcutaneous infusion of a levodopa formulation was approved by Health Canada in 2023 and will become available in the near future.​[[22]](#SoileauMJAldredJBudurKEtAl.SafetyAn-1A98035C)

A variety of strategies can be used to help treat patients who have developed wearing off or dyskinesia (see [Figure 2](#c0015n00014)).

### Dopamine Agonists

Bromocriptine, pramipexole and ropinirole are effective as monotherapy in the early stages of the disease, and as adjunctive therapy with levodopa for patients with more advanced motor complications.​[[18]](#c0015n00025)​[[19]](#c0015n00026) Rotigotine, available as a transdermal patch formulation, has been shown to be effective in reducing Parkinson disease symptoms.​[[23]](#c0015n00176) Transdermal delivery results in stable plasma concentrations (which avoids pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors), offers an alternative for patients wishing to reduce oral medications and may result in improved adherence.

Because bromocriptine can cause pulmonary fibrosis, the newer, non-ergot dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) are better choices. Daytime sleepiness or sudden irresistible attacks of sleep can occur with all of the dopamine replacement medications, including levodopa, but occur more frequently with dopamine agonists compared with levodopa.​[[24]](#c0015n00030) Impulse control disorders such as binge eating, excessive shopping, hypersexual behaviour or pathologic gambling occur in up to 50% of patients taking dopamine agonists. It is important to discuss these significant side effects with your patient.​[[25]](#c0015n00171) Additional difficulties with dopamine agonists compared with levodopa include more GI upset, orthostatic hypotension and psychiatric reactions (hallucinations and confusion); in addition, supplementary levodopa is almost always required for supervening disability after varying periods of time. For these reasons, there has been a shift away from using dopamine agonists; they are also not recommended for patients older than 70 years of age.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)

Apomorphine, another dopamine agonist, is indicated for short-term use during an off-episode that has not responded to adjustments to other medications. The onset of action is 10–15 minutes, with a duration of action of approximately 90 minutes. There is a significant risk of GI upset at the initiation of treatment that requires up to 3 days of pretreatment with domperidone. The initial dose is administered under medical supervision, typically in an outpatient clinic, in order to determine an appropriate starting dose and to assess for adverse effects, particularly orthostatic hypotension. Apomorphine is discontinued in Canada; the subcutaneous injection is no longer available and the sublingual film will no longer be available as of October 2023.

### Monoamine Oxidase B Inhibitors

Early clinical evaluations of selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), suggested that it might slow the progression of PD. Evidence now indicates that it does not have a substantial neuroprotective effect, and most of the apparent benefit during the first year of treatment is likely due to its mild effects on symptoms.​[[19]](#c0015n00026) In addition, it does not delay the development of dyskinesia or fluctuations associated with chronic levodopa therapy. Rasagiline is a more potent MAO-B inhibitor that can be used as initial treatment to improve motor symptoms and for patients with more advanced disease to help with wearing off. There are no convincing studies that have shown that it slows disease progression.​[[26]](#c0015n00172) Safinamide is now available and acts as an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B and also as a modulator of glutamate. The clinical benefits of glutamate modulation are unclear; at this point, safinamide has been approved in Canada only as an add-on treatment for wearing-off symptoms.

### Amantadine

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of amantadine in the treatment of patients with early PD but it does improve levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the later stages of the disease.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Its exact mechanism of action is unclear but it may release dopamine from the presynaptic terminals or block its reuptake. Amantadine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist with glutamatergic properties, which may account for some of its anti-dyskinetic efficacy. It is easy to use and usually well tolerated; leg edema, blurred vision, dry mouth, skin discoloration and livedo reticularis (a reversible condition characterized by a bluish, mottled appearance of the skin, mainly of the lower extremities) are the most common adverse events. In patients with cognitive deficits, amantadine can increase confusion and should not be used.

### Anticholinergics

Anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, ethopropazine and trihexyphenidyl have been used in the treatment of PD for decades, since before the availability of levodopa. Their major putative effect is on tremor, with little or no effect on bradykinesia; however, this has not been well studied.​[[13]](#c0015n00021) Anticholinergic drugs should not be used as first-line treatment in patients with PD because of their limited efficacy and their many side effects (e.g., dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation), especially in the elderly.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) They should not be used in patients with dyskinesias and/or motor fluctuations.​[[27]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-282F412A)

### Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase (COMT) Inhibitors

Entacapone is an inhibitor of COMT, an enzyme that helps metabolize levodopa in both the brain and in the peripheral nervous system. It helps prevent peripheral metabolism of levodopa, which increases its availability to the brain, and has no effect if not used in conjunction with levodopa. Despite some studies showing additional improvement in activities of daily living, in nonfluctuating patients its use should be limited to patients with wearing off.​[[18]](#c0015n00025) Most of its side effects relate to increased dopaminergic activity in the brain such as dyskinesia, and less often, confusion and/or hallucinations.

Opicapone is another COMT inhibitor that is US FDA-approved but not available in Canada; it has a longer half-life that enables once-daily dosing.​[[28]](#FerreiraJJLeesARochaJFEtAl.Opicapon)

**Table 1:** Drug Therapy Based on Parkinson Disease Progression

| Drug Class | Disease Progression Over Time | Effect on Early Motor Symptoms (primarily bradykinesia) | Effect on Motor Fluctuation/Dyskinesia |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-Line Therapy |
| Levodopa | Efficacy: +++ Long-lasting response following single dose Initial therapy in most patients Trend to hold off for patients younger at onset (<60 y) is now questioned | Associated motor complications: +++ Slow-release formulation may benefit patients with wearing off, but more erratic absorption limits its use to bedtime Increasing frequency of levodopa may help with wearing off Higher doses are associated with more dyskinesia; more frequent and smaller doses may be necessary |
| Dopamine agonists ​ [a] | Efficacy: ++ Effective as monotherapy (less effective than levodopa) Was typically used as initial therapy in patients younger at onset (<60 y), although this trend is now questioned | Associated motor complications: ++ Effective as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in patients with wearing off.

### Treatment of Nonmotor Issues

*Depression* is common in PD, but keep in mind that a lack of facial expression in a patient with PD does not necessarily indicate sadness or depression. SSRIs, SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been the mainstay of therapy for depression in patients with PD, with an increasing number of studies showing improvement with a wide variety of antidepressants.​[[29]](#refitem-1162119-1E7AF4ED) TCAs should be used cautiously because their anticholinergic effects are more likely to induce delirium, especially in memory-impaired patients; they may also aggravate orthostatic hypotension, which can increase the risk of falls. For more general information on antidepressants, see Depression.

*Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder* is common in PD and can predate the onset of motor symptoms by more than 10 years. It is characterized by dream-enactment behaviours that emerge during a loss of REM sleep atonia. Clonazepam (0.25–1 mg) and melatonin (3–12 mg) given before sleep can suppress REM sleep behaviour disorder; clonazepam is more effective but with a higher rate of side effects.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Nonpharmacologic interventions may also help; for more information, see Insomnia.

*Psychosis* is common in PD, typically in patients with more advanced disease. All medications used to treat motor symptoms can contribute to psychosis in a dose-related fashion. There is no need to treat hallucinations/delusions if they are well tolerated by the patient/caregivers.​[[27]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-282F412A) As the disease progresses, PD medications often need to be reduced or withdrawn because of worsening of the patient’s cognitive status. Usually, anticholinergics are withdrawn first, then selegiline, rasagiline, amantadine, dopamine agonists and COMT inhibitors, until only levodopa remains. At that point, reducing the dose of levodopa is an option. Review other (non-PD) medications carefully to ensure they are not also contributing to the psychosis. For patients in whom an optimum balance cannot be found by adjusting PD medications, the antipsychotics quetiapine or clozapine are sometimes used. Although all antipsychotics have some potential to reduce control of movement disorders, clozapine appears to have the lowest risk and has shown clear benefit in randomized controlled trials for management of psychotic symptoms in patients with PD.​[[1]](#c0015n00020) Quetiapine has not shown consistent benefit in clinical trials, yet is often tried first to avoid the blood monitoring requirements with clozapine use.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)​[[30]](#ChenJJHuaHMassihiLEtAlSystematicLi-B407A958) With the exception of quetiapine and clozapine, all other antipsychotics should be avoided in PD psychosis. A recent addition to the treatment armamentarium of psychosis in Parkinson disease is pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2a) inverse agonist; however, this is not yet available in Canada. For more information, see Schizophrenia and Related Psychotic Disorders.

*Dementia* is also common in patients with PD. Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine) have a modest impact on improving dementia, but careful observation for deterioration in motor function is required.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)​[[31]](#c0015n00190) For more information, see Dementia.

*Autonomic dysfunction* causes many issues that tend to increase as the disease progresses.

- Orthostatic hypotension: if conservative measures (e.g., increasing salt intake and hydration, avoiding alcohol, deprescribing contributing medications) are not helpful, then adding domperidone, midodrine and/or fludrocortisone may be considered.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Urinary urgency and incontinence: may be treated with anticholinergic drugs; options with less blood-brain penetration (e.g., darifenacin, trospium) or the newer nonanticholinergic agents that are less likely to cause confusion (e.g., mirabegron) are preferred (see also Urinary Incontinence in Adults).
- Erectile dysfunction: sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil may all be used (see also Male Sexual Dysfunction).​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Constipation: requires continuous monitoring and treatment, as it is an almost universal problem. Limit drugs that have any anticholinergic effect. Ensure the patient has proper hydration with a high fibre diet and exercise before considering treatments like polyethylene glycol, lactulose, probiotics​[[32]](#TanAHLimSYChongKKEtAl.ProbioticsFor-1A9B38BD) or fibre supplements such as psyllium (see also Constipation in Adults).​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Sialorrhea: onabotulinumtoxinA injection, administered by a specialist into the salivary glands, has been shown to be efficacious for symptomatic control; other medication options are typically poorly tolerated by patients with PD (e.g., atropine drops, ipratropium bromide spray, glycopyrrolate).​[[1]](#c0015n00020)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Symptomatic treatment is not necessary in the early stage of PD when symptoms are noticed but not troublesome. All drugs have the potential to cause side effects that would outweigh their benefits at this stage of the disease.
- Start medication at low doses and titrate slowly, especially in the elderly, to minimize the acute side effects of medications.
- When levodopa or a dopamine agonist are initiated, if gastric upset or orthostatic hypotension occur, **domperidone** (10–20 mg 30 min prior to each dose) may be helpful but is typically only needed for the first few months of therapy.​[[33]](#JostWHGastrointestinalMotilityProb-45100660) Observational studies suggest that domperidone use may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in patients with PD who have a history of cardiovascular disease.​[[34]](#RenouxCDellAnielloSKhairyPEtAlVent-41962FE0)
- Levodopa should be taken with food early in therapy to ease nausea. In more advanced disease, protein-rich foods interfere with levodopa absorption; avoid concurrent administration to help manage motor fluctuations.
- Individualize patient management based on the severity of disease, level of disability, cost, patient’s preference and patient’s age.
- Refer patients with dyskinesia and/or motor fluctuations to a health-care professional with specialist expertise in PD before modifying therapy.​[[27]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-282F412A)
- Optimizing the management of nonmotor difficulties and including the assistance of allied health professionals is important for maximizing a patient’s quality of life.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Impulse control disorders can develop in PD patients under any dopaminergic therapy; patients taking dopamine agonists, with a history of previous impulsive behaviours, and/or a history of alcohol consumption and/or smoking are at increased risk.​[[27]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-282F412A)
- Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (similar to neuroleptic malignant syndrome) is a potentially fatal complication of PD treatment usually associated with abrupt reduction or discontinuation of dopaminergic drugs. Hyponatremia is also a risk factor. Medications should be reduced or withdrawn slowly. “Drug holidays” to reduce motor complications are not a recommended practice.​[[1]](#c0015n00020)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding are uncommon considerations among patients with PD. Expert consultation should be sought where possible; amantadine should be avoided.

Rasagiline: use lower dose of 0.5 mg daily in patients taking ciprofloxacin or other CYP 1A2 inhibitors. | Preliminary evidence suggests that MAO-B inhibitors may be safely used with concurrent SSRI therapy in PD patients with depression under careful observation and using conservative dosing.​ [36] ​ [37] |
| safinamide Onstryv $200–250 | Adjunctive therapy: 50 mg daily PO; may increase to 100 mg daily after 2 wk, based on patient response and tolerability Moderate hepatic impairment: 50 mg daily maximum; avoid in patients with severe impairment | Insomnia, confusion, hallucinations, increased dyskinesia, nausea, orthostatic hypotension and other types of autonomic dysfunction. Safinamide: hypertension is more common than orthostatic hypotension. | Avoid concurrent use with serotonergic and other CNS modulators due to increased risk of serotonin syndrome and/or hypertensive crisis (e.g., atomoxetine, bupropion, dextroamphetamine, dextromethorphan, meperidine, pseudoephedrine, TCAs, MAO-A inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs). | Preliminary evidence suggests that MAO-B inhibitors may be safely used with concurrent SSRI therapy in PD patients with depression under careful observation and using conservative dosing.​ [36] ​ [37] |
| selegiline (deprenyl) generics < $50 | 2.5 mg daily– 5 mg BID PO Give before 1 p.m. | Insomnia, confusion, hallucinations, increased dyskinesia, nausea, orthostatic hypotension and other types of autonomic dysfunction. | Avoid concurrent use with serotonergic and other CNS modulators due to increased risk of serotonin syndrome and/or hypertensive crisis (e.g., atomoxetine, bupropion, dextroamphetamine, dextromethorphan, meperidine, pseudoephedrine, TCAs, MAO-A inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs). Selegiline: oral contraceptives may inhibit selegiline’s metabolism, increasing the risk of side effects; reducing the dose of selegiline may be necessary. | Preliminary evidence suggests that MAO-B inhibitors may be safely used with concurrent SSRI therapy in PD patients with depression under careful observation and using conservative dosing.​ [36] ​ [37] |

**Drug Class: N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) Receptor Antagonists**
