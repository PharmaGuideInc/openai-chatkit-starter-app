CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, the content in this chapter is based on clinical research that may not reflect the identity of every patient. For additional resources, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standards of Care may be helpful. When the terms “females” and “males” are used in the text, it is to align with the clinical literature. We are aware these terms do not encompass all patient identities.

### Pathophysiology

### Corns and Calluses

The development of a corn (clavus, heloma) or a callus (tyloma) can occur when keratinization becomes overactive in an attempt to protect the foot from excessive friction or when pressure from the skin rubs against bony areas of the foot.​[[1]](#psc1053n1001) Calluses and corns are more predominant in females than in males and can develop at any age.​[[2]](#psc1053n1002)

Poorly fitting footwear is the primary cause of corns and calluses, especially in older patients.​[[3]](#psc1053n1003)​[[4]](#psc1053n1006) Calluses may also form as a result of weight gain, abnormal gait due to over or under foot pronation, and altered foot structure (e.g., bunion, hammer toe).​[[3]](#psc1053n1003)​[[5]](#DemirBErdenIUcakHEtAl.QualityOfLife-D8CC4FA8)

### Bunions

A bunion (hallux valgus) is a deformed great toe joint (first metatarsophalangeal or MTP joint), where the joint is angled outward with the great toe angled toward the other toes (see [Figure 1](#psc1053n00007)).​[[6]](#MaXEtAl.FootAndAnkleWorkingCommitte-D8C99D42) A deformity of the fifth MTP joint, thought to be inherited, is commonly known as a *bunionette*, or *tailors bunion*.​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A)​[[8]](#AjisAKotiMMaffulliNEtAl.Tailorx2019-D8C9A2B0) Bunions have a prevalence of 23% in adults, which increases with age, although in one retrospective study, the prevalence was noted to be higher, at 51%, with predominance in females and shoe shape as a contributing factor.​[[9]](#NixSSmithMVicenzinoB.etAl.Prevalenc-D8C9A55E)​[[10]](#MontielVAlfonsoMVillasCEtAl.MedialA-D8C9A7E4) One in 3 adults over the age of 65, 1 in 4 adults aged 16 to 65 and 8% of children under the age of 18 are thought to be affected.​[[9]](#NixSSmithMVicenzinoB.etAl.Prevalenc-D8C9A55E)​[[11]](#FallatLMEtAlBuckholzJ.AnAnalysisOfT-D8C9AA82) Females with this foot condition outnumber males by a ratio greater than 2 to 1.​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A)

A diagnosis of this foot condition is confirmed with radiographic evidence, including a hallux valgus angle greater than 15 degrees, which may assist in the selection of future surgical intervention, if warranted.​[[6]](#MaXEtAl.FootAndAnkleWorkingCommitte-D8C99D42)​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A)​[[10]](#MontielVAlfonsoMVillasCEtAl.MedialA-D8C9A7E4)

Although individuals with bunions may be asymptomatic, pain associated with the deformity is the most predominant symptom.​[[10]](#MontielVAlfonsoMVillasCEtAl.MedialA-D8C9A7E4)​[[12]](#ThomasJTLKunkelMWLopezREtAl.Radiogr-D8C9AD0E) Other signs and symptoms may include callus formation and bursa inflammation.​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A) The presence of bunions results in reduced foot function, challenges with footwear fitting, unsightly appearance and impaired quality of life.​[[13]](#HumSVicenzinoBTEtAlSmithMD.Non-surg-D8C9AEE2)

Risk factors for developing bunions include the following: wearing improper tight-fitting footwear, walking with an abnormal gait due to foot pronation over or under by 6 degrees, maintaining constant abnormal joint motion and pressure, damaging the joint space due to arthritis, and inheriting the foot’s bone structure (e.g., pes planus).​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A)​[[10]](#MontielVAlfonsoMVillasCEtAl.MedialA-D8C9A7E4)

### Ingrown Toenails

Ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis) have nail edges that curve and grow into the soft tissue surrounding the toenails, usually that of the great toes.​[[14]](#ChangSCWangCHongCEtAl.ParonychiaWit-D8CC5277) The soft tissue that has been penetrated by the nail edge becomes irritated and often appears red and inflamed. If left untreated, more serious foot conditions (bacterial infection [e.g., cellulitis] or fungal infection [e.g., onychomycosis]) may develop and have an impact on the individual’s quality of life.​[[15]](#WatabeAYamasakiKHashimotoAEtAl.Retr-D8CC5568) Risk factors include toe-crowding due to wearing improper tight-fitting footwear, improper trimming of toenails, heredity and trauma. The incidence in males is double that of females and is highest between 10 and 30 years of age.

### Goals of Therapy

- Resolve symptoms
- Eliminate the cause of the lesion so that it may regress (or not progress in the case of bunions)
- Cure any infection, if present
- Prevent recurrence

### Patient Assessment

Feet and foot­wear inspection is important whenever possible.​[[1]](#psc1053n1001)​[[3]](#psc1053n1003)​[[10]](#MontielVAlfonsoMVillasCEtAl.MedialA-D8C9A7E4)​[[16]](#psc1053n01032)​[[17]](#880D0BC4)​[[18]](#880D106A)​[[19]](#psc1053n1010) Individuals with specific medical conditions (e.g., diabetes) should be examined by a health-care practitioner with foot-care expertise at least once yearly.​[[18]](#880D106A) More frequent inspections would be warranted if a higher level of risk to develop a more serious problem is determined during the assessment. Validated tools are available to complete this task to note the presence of lesions; changes in skin colour, sensation, texture or temperature; swelling; pain; rashes; signs of gangrene (dryness, moisture, gas); or deformities such as bunions or hammer toes.​[[1]](#psc1053n1001)​[[18]](#880D106A)​[[20]](#psc1053n1011)​[[21]](#psc1053n1013) Check the fit of the shoe (see [Table 1](#table-113231-D743AB0E)).

**Table 1:** Footwear Suitability Assessment

| Footwear Feature | Special Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| Footwear Construction | Fasteners: buckles, laces or velcro preferred—more foot stability no “slip-on” footwear—avoid foot slipping within the footwear Material: canvas or leather—moisture from sweat removed and more flexible Soles: therapeutic rocker soles to accommodate off-loading of foot pressure points flexible and lightweight under the balls of the feet—shock-absorbing, cushioned (e.g., crepe, rubber) |
| Footwear Measurement | Heel height: lower than 3.75 cm (1.5 in.)—prevent forward pressure and toe crowding Length: accommodate the foot to avoid rubbing within or tightness of the footwear and avoid heel slipping up and down during ambulation Width: wide toe box to allow front foot width comfort, especially when standing; the first MTP joint (located at the base of the great toe) should fit into the widest part of the toe box—allow 1.25 cm (0.5 in.) between the end of the footwear and the longest toe to avoid bumping into the head of the footwear during ambulation |
| Footwear Purchase | wear new footwear approximately one-half hour daily at first—gradually break it in purchase footwear at the end of the day—feet are most swollen due to gravity pulling fluid in the body down to the feet check for tightness or rubbing within the footwear—if applicable, orthotics should be worn at the point of purchase wear socks or stockings when purchasing footwear—feet may not be the same size |
| Footwear Type (for planned activity) | Employment: specific footwear based on job requirements, e.g., steel-toed boots Sports enthusiasts: specific footwear based on sport, e.g., hiking boots, running shoes, soccer shoes |

### Corns and Calluses

Corns (helomas) appear as tough layers of compacted, dead skin cells, which may have a central cone (radix) over the bony area or spur.​[[17]](#880D0BC4) The radix is triangular in shape and points inward. The affected area may also be yellowed.

Hard corns favour the areas over the 5​th toe joint and on the soles of the feet, while soft corns are found between the toes, especially between the fourth and fifth ([see Photo, Corns](#psc1053n01029)). Corns are rarely found under a toenail. Hard corns may be confused with plantar warts (verruca plantaris). However, when the top layer of skin cells is removed, pinpoint bleeding is observed with plantar warts. In addition, skin ridges pass through corns but around plantar warts.

**Photo 1:** Corns

A soft corn is essentially a hard corn that has absorbed moisture from sweat, becoming macerated. Soft corns are often confused with athletes foot. However, soft corns are often quite painful, whereas athletes foot tends to be pruritic and usually not painful. Corns may also become inflamed or infected.

Calluses (tylomas) have a similar appearance to corns and tend to be well defined. They are of relatively even thickness and do not have a radix. Calluses tend to occur on the soles of the feet, especially on the heel or ball of the foot.

A burning sensation and pain when the affected area is compressed may indicate the presence of a corn or callus.

If calluses and corns are left unattended, progression to more serious conditions may occur (e.g., increased pain, deformity, abnormal gait, foot infections).​[[4]](#psc1053n1006)​[[5]](#DemirBErdenIUcakHEtAl.QualityOfLife-D8CC4FA8)

### Bunions

A bunion looks like a bump on the outside edge of the affected foot. Its distinctive appearance along with swelling, pain and redness are characteristic of this foot condition. Individuals with a bunion should receive early treatment to stabilize the joint and to correct foot alignment.​[[22]](#880DC5F6)

[Figure 3](#psc1053n00012) depicts the assessment and management of corns, calluses and bunions.

### Ingrown Toenails

The penetration of the toenail into the surrounding soft tissue may cause irritation, which may be painful and tender.​[[15]](#WatabeAYamasakiKHashimotoAEtAl.Retr-D8CC5568) If left unattended, infection (paronychia), abscess formation and deformity may result.​[[23]](#DuJXiXEtAlLiuZH.SuccessfulConservat-D8CC5929) Chronic paronychia is rarely found in toes, and if diagnosed, may be due to occupational hazards, drugs, dermatological conditions or tumors.​[[24]](#psc1053n1015)

### Corns, Calluses and Bunions

Identifying and removing the cause of the lesion is the most important step in the treatment of corns, calluses or bunions. Individuals should be instructed to perform regular foot self-examinations. The most common intervention is a change in footwear in both children and adults. This is often the only treatment required.​[[13]](#HumSVicenzinoBTEtAlSmithMD.Non-surg-D8C9AEE2) Orthotic devices may be inserted into footwear to provide arch support and to distribute body weight more evenly so that excess pressure is removed from the affected area of the foot.​[[13]](#HumSVicenzinoBTEtAlSmithMD.Non-surg-D8C9AEE2)​[[18]](#880D106A) These conservative approaches will take time to resolve the foot condition, especially with individuals who are very active.​[[18]](#880D106A)

Devices such as cushions, felt pads, latex foam, orthotics, night-splints and silicone toe sleeves can be used to protect a corn, callus or bunion.​[[1]](#psc1053n1001)​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A)​[[8]](#AjisAKotiMMaffulliNEtAl.Tailorx2019-D8C9A2B0)​[[13]](#HumSVicenzinoBTEtAlSmithMD.Non-surg-D8C9AEE2)​[[18]](#880D106A) A variety of shapes and sizes are available to accommodate the various lesions. Custom pads can be constructed from moleskin or lambswool. Placing lambswool between the toes affected by a soft corn can decrease the pain.

There are several nonpharmacologic choices to treat corns; however, none are ideal.​[[18]](#880D106A)​[[25]](#psc1053n1017) Débridement of the lesion is considered first-line treatment along with the application of keratolytics.​[[3]](#psc1053n1003)​[[18]](#880D106A)​[[26]](#HashmiFNesterCWrightCREtAl.TheEvalu-D8D5DC62)

Débridement of a corn or callus using a pumice stone can be performed after soaking the area in warm water for about 10 minutes with or without sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Castor, olive, sesame seed or wheat germ oils can be applied to the affected area to soften corns or calluses. The abrasive action of walking on wet sand can assist in the removal of dead skin from the soles of the feet. A foot file (e.g., emery board) can be used on a dry foot. Persons with specific medical conditions such as diabetes should not self-treat corns or calluses. Excising corns with electrosurgery may result in superior pain relief at 6 months compared with standard sharp débridement with a scalpel or scissors.​[[27]](#psc1053n01030)

When nonsurgical interventions have failed to adequately relieve pain and discomfort, surgery is indicated for both adults and children. The choice of surgical options for bunions is based on a variety of factors.​[[6]](#MaXEtAl.FootAndAnkleWorkingCommitte-D8C99D42)​[[8]](#AjisAKotiMMaffulliNEtAl.Tailorx2019-D8C9A2B0)​[[13]](#HumSVicenzinoBTEtAlSmithMD.Non-surg-D8C9AEE2)​[[24]](#psc1053n1015)​[[28]](#JohnsonJEClantonTOBaxterDEEtAl.Comp-D8D5D834)​[[29]](#SchneiderW.DistalSoftTissueProcedur-D8D5D59A)​[[30]](#Faour-MartinOMartin-FerreroMAValver-D8D5D2E0)​[[31]](#psc1053n01022) In an economic study, surgical intervention to correct bunions was found to be cost effective when overall gains in health were considered.​[[32]](#psc1053n1012) The recurrence risk is high if all of the elements of the bunion condition, such as the surgeon’s approach, the patient’s status and a complete deformity assessment are not initially considered and corrected.​[[33]](#DuanXKadakiaA.SalvageOfRecurrenceAf-D8D5CEE6)

### Ingrown Toenails

Polyurethane foam toecaps are useful as protective devices for ingrown toenails. Determining optimum shoe fit and altering footwear to remove pressure points may prevent recurrences of ingrown toenails. To prevent toenails from becoming ingrown, trim them straight across and do not round the corners.​[[16]](#psc1053n01032)​[[34]](#psc1053n01031) The corners of nails should project beyond the skin (see [Figure 2](#psc1053n00016)). Instruments such as rounded-end scissors and nail clippers should be handled with care, and individuals with impaired vision or poor dexterity should avoid their use altogether to avoid foot injuries. Individuals with special medical conditions (e.g., diabetes) who enjoy pedicures can request personnel to use a kit that is specially designed for persons with diabetes. A foot-care specialist may excise infected tissue or chemically destroy the nail matrix for effective treatment of ingrown toenails.​[[15]](#WatabeAYamasakiKHashimotoAEtAl.Retr-D8CC5568)​[[16]](#psc1053n01032)​[[31]](#psc1053n01022)​[[34]](#psc1053n01031) Other conservative treatments include the insertion of cotton-wool in the corner of the nail with silver nitrate cautery of the granulation tissue, flexible tube splinting, and using electric wire or shape-memory alloy devices.​[[15]](#WatabeAYamasakiKHashimotoAEtAl.Retr-D8CC5568) Several months may be required for nail growth to reform the ingrown toenail.​[[15]](#WatabeAYamasakiKHashimotoAEtAl.Retr-D8CC5568)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

### Prevention

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Skin Care Products: Dermatitis and Dry Skin.

Maintaining moisture balance and removing dead skin cells help prevent formation of corns and calluses. Neutral, unscented, **moisturizing topical products** without acid content may be applied to dry skin on the feet (except between the toes, as it may cause excessive softening) to prevent the formation of corns and calluses or to soften existing lesions. **Hydrating products** with humectants soften the skin (e.g., Nivea, Glaxal Base). **Anti-dehydration products** form a film on the skin to reduce moisture evaporation (e.g., Lubriderm lotion, Cetaphil, Keri lotion, Vaseline Intensive Care lotion, silicone cream). Hydrating products containing keratolytic and exfoliating ingredients should be applied only to the top layer of skin (stratum corneum) and not to broken skin. These products assist with the removal of dead skin cells (e.g., Uremol 10, Dermal Therapy with urea concentrations 10%, 15%, 20% or 25%). Urea has the potential to cause burning or tingling sensations when applied to dry or cracked skin.

### Corns and Calluses

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Foot Care Products: Corns, Calluses and Warts.

Salicylic acid in concentrations of up to 40% is available for the self-treatment of corns and calluses.​[[35]](#psc1053n1014) Although various concentrations of salicylic acid appear to be successful in treating corns and calluses, there is no strong evidence for their effectiveness in treating these foot conditions. Salicylic acid concentrations of 12–40% may be indicated if the cause of the lesion is not easily corrected or if the patient is too uncomfortable to wait for the lesion to regress once the cause has been removed. Some products are described in [Table 2](#d2e1013).

Plasters and pads tend to adhere to the lesion better than liquid dosage forms. Salicylic acid will damage normal skin, so it is important that it not be applied outside the edge of the corn or callus. When liquid preparations are used, the normal skin surrounding the lesion can be protected with an occlusive application of petrolatum or a mechanical occlusion, such as a bandage with an aperture for application of the product. Liquid collodion vehicles should not be used by older patients due to the risk of poor vision, or by children due to the potential for poisoning by ingestion or inhalation.

### Bunions

Use of ice packs and analgesics such as acetaminophen or **NSAIDs** may be considered to reduce pain and swelling of an inflamed bunion.​[[7]](#ThomasJLBlitchELChaneyDMEtAl.Diagno-D8C9A02A) If nonpharmacologic approaches or analgesics are inadequate, intra-articular corticosteroids may be considered for pain reduction.

### Ingrown Toenails

Refer patients with ingrown toenails to a foot-care specialist. In the interim, general measures can be employed to control infections or relieve pain and inflammation.​[[36]](#psc1053n01021) Protection from infection can be achieved with the use of topical antibiotics. Topical antiseptics (e.g., **alcohol** 70% swabs, povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate 0.05% dressings) or foot bath solutions (e.g., 15 mL of povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate 2% or 4% in 1 litre of lukewarm boiled water) can be used to disinfect the skin. Local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine 20% solution) or hypertonic saline or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) foot baths 3 or 4 times daily may be useful in reducing pain. Foot baths are typically used for no longer than 10 minutes.

The treatment of choice is partial surgical removal of the nail border with or without destruction of the nail bed matrix.​[[36]](#psc1053n01021) Chemical agents, such as **phenol**, **sodium hydroxide** or **trichloroacetic acid**, are often used in conjunction with this procedure.​[[24]](#psc1053n1015)​[[37]](#RoundingCBloomfieldSEtAl.SurgicalTr-D8D5C9A0)​[[38]](#Romero-PerezDBetlloch-MasIEncabo-Du-D8D5C671) After surgery, the area is kept dry overnight with the foot elevated. This is generally followed by daily foot soaks and antibiotic ointment application starting 48 hours after the procedure. Oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or **NSAIDs**) may be considered for pain management, if appropriate. Depending upon the presence and extent of infection, systemic antibiotics may be used; however, the available evidence suggests that oral antibiotics taken before or after surgery do not decrease healing time. Further assessment is required if signs of infection develop or persist (e.g., erythema, swelling, purulent discharge).

### Monitoring of Therapy

### Corns and Calluses

Clinical improvement should be evident within 10–14 days after initiating treatment with a salicylic acid–containing product. Advise the patient to inspect the affected area at least twice weekly until healing is complete. If no improvement is noted, refer to a foot-care specialist. If normal skin surrounding the lesion is damaged by incorrect use of salicylic acid preparations, recommend discontinuation of the product until the normal skin is healed. If the lesion becomes red or inflamed or drains purulent material, refer to a foot-care specialist.

### Advice for the Patient

Advise the patient regarding:

- Foot inspection for lesions
- Strategies for preventing future occurrences, including proper fit of footwear
- Nonpharmacologic treatment
- Proper use of protective devices
- Pharmacologic treatment, including proper use of a salicylic acid product, if indicated
- When to seek the attention of a foot-care specialist
