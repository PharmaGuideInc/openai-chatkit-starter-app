### Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant-cell arteritis (GCA) are related inflammatory disorders that affect older individuals and may reflect a spectrum of the same disease. PMR is characterized by bilateral aching and stiffness in the muscle groups of the neck, pectoral and pelvic girdles, and thighs. The prevalence approaches 1% of people over the age of 50,​[[1]](#c0057n00096)​[[2]](#c0057n00011) and the lifetime risk of developing the disease has been estimated at 2.4% for women and 1.7% for men.​[[3]](#c0057n00122)

GCA is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-sized arteries with predominance for the cranial branches of the arteries originating from the aortic arch. Thus, headache, jaw claudication and visual loss are characteristic presentations. GCA is less frequent than PMR and affects approximately 0.2% of people 50 years of age and older, with a peak incidence at 70–75 years of age.​[[1]](#c0057n00096)​[[4]](#refitem-118214-37BADD19)​[[5]](#c0057n00012)

Both conditions are twice as frequent in women than in men. There is a clear association between PMR and GCA. Approximately 16–21% of patients with PMR will develop GCA concurrently or subsequent to the diagnosis of PMR;​[[1]](#c0057n00096)​[[2]](#c0057n00011)​[[6]](#c0057n00013) conversely 40–60% of patients with GCA will develop symptoms of PMR. Although the etiology of both conditions is unknown, PMR is characterized pathologically by low-grade synovitis of the proximal joints, while the hallmark of GCA is granulomatous inflammation with giant cells of affected arterial walls. Both conditions may be associated with systemic clinical manifestations.

### Goals of Therapy

- Eliminate symptoms of musculoskeletal pain and stiffness and associated malaise
- Restore function
- Relieve symptoms of GCA and prevent permanent visual loss
- Minimize frequency and severity of corticosteroid toxicity

### Investigations

The value of a thorough history and physical examination cannot be overemphasized. PMR and GCA are clinical diagnoses. Other than a positive temporal artery biopsy, there are no laboratory tests that are specific for either disease.

The diagnostic approach is outlined in [Figure 1](#c0057n00004) and differential diagnosis in [Table 1](#c0057n00005).

### History

Patients with PMR typically present with the following characteristics:

- Significant proximal muscle discomfort, especially around the shoulders, across the neck, and in the buttocks and thighs. The pain is generally severe and usually interferes with activities of daily living.
- Acute onset. Many patients can pinpoint the start of their symptoms to a specific day.
- Musculoskeletal morning stiffness lasting for hours, which is a prominent feature. Symptoms tend to worsen through the night, and movement during sleep causes discomfort severe enough to wake the patient.
- Systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, anorexia weight loss and fatigue may be present in 40–50% of patients.​[[4]](#refitem-118214-37BADD19)

Patients who present with PMR should be questioned specifically about symptoms of GCA.

Patients with GCA most frequently present with the following characteristics:

- Headache and scalp tenderness in the temporal or occipital areas, claudication of the jaw or tongue (pain following prolonged chewing or talking), and partial or complete monocular visual loss, which may affect the contralateral eye, even within 2 weeks after starting corticosteroid therapy.
- Additional distinct clinical presentations, which may occur based upon the pattern of vascular involvement and the degree of systemic symptoms.​[[9]](#c0057n00029) For example, involvement of large vessels such as the branches of the aortic arch, similar to that seen in Takayasu arteritis, may occur in up to 25% of cases and can be manifested by upper limb claudication. The treatment and outcome are comparable to GCA without large vessel involvement.​[[10]](#c0057n00093)
- Systemic symptoms, including fever, occur in up to 50% of cases.

A recognized late complication of GCA is a 17-fold increase in thoracic aortic aneurysm.​[[11]](#c0057n00015)

### Physical Examination

Patients with suspected PMR:

- The physical findings in PMR are nonspecific and usually reveal a reduction in active range of motion of the neck and shoulders due to pain rather than muscle weakness.
- Large and small joint synovitis may be present but is unusual in locations distal to the wrist and ankle. Severe swelling with pitting edema over the dorsum of both hands and feet may also occur and forms a distinct clinical subset.​[[12]](#c0057n00030)​[[13]](#c0057n00031)
- Proximal muscle tenderness may be present but muscle weakness, although difficult to assess due to pain, is not a predominant feature of PMR.

Patients with suspected GCA:

- Diminished or absent temporal artery pulsation and associated scalp tenderness, coupled with an appropriate history, is suggestive of GCA.
- Loss of upper limb pulses with audible bruits may occur in patients with involvement of the branches of the aortic arch.

### Laboratory Tests

Patients with suspected PMR or GCA:

- A rapid ESR is usually present. However, 5–6% of patients with PMR and GCA will have a normal ESR.​[[14]](#c0057n00032)​[[15]](#c0057n00016)
- CRP is most often elevated. In the majority of cases where ESR is normal, the CRP is elevated.​[[14]](#c0057n00032)
- Anemia and/or thrombocytosis may also be found in patients presenting with PMR or GCA.
- A number of conditions must be considered in the differential diagnosis of PMR (see [Table 1](#c0057n00005)), although GCA can usually be readily distinguished from other forms of vasculitis.
- Temporal artery biopsy is indicated only if there is a clinical suspicion of GCA and is not routinely recommended in patients who present with isolated PMR. Due to patchy involvement of affected vessels, a normal biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis. Thus, even when up to 5 cm of bilateral temporal arteries are sampled, 9% of suspected cases have normal biopsies.​[[16]](#c0057n00033)​[[17]](#c0057n00034)​[[18]](#c0057n00035)​[[19]](#c0057n00036) More recent studies have suggested that performing bilateral temporal artery biopsies increases the diagnostic yield by 1–12.7%.​[[20]](#c0057n00037)​[[21]](#c0057n00090) Corticosteroid therapy should not be withheld while awaiting the result of a temporal artery biopsy. This biopsy can still show changes of arteritis when performed up to 4 weeks following the commencement of corticosteroid therapy.​[[22]](#c0057n00038)​[[23]](#c0057n00039) The diagnostic approach is outlined in [Figure 1](#c0057n00004).

### Polymyalgia Rheumatica

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Corticosteroids

NSAIDs are generally ineffective or provide only partial improvement of symptoms in patients with PMR. Thus, systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy. Prednisone 10–20 mg/day results in rapid and sustained clinical improvement. Although doses up to 25 mg have been recommended, there is limited evidence to suggest the optimum starting dose.​[[24]](#refitem-1182131-38C68D8A) Elderly patients often have relevant comorbidities such as diabetes, osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease where lower initial dosages are preferred (see [Table 2](#c0057n00052)). Substantial or complete resolution of symptoms occurs within days after prednisone administration. In fact, the diagnosis of PMR should be reconsidered if symptoms fail to improve significantly after 1 week of corticosteroid therapy.​[[25]](#c0057n00127) Most patients require 1–2 years of therapy, although 30–50% will experience exacerbations over this period.​[[26]](#c0057n00018) Some patients require corticosteroids for 5–10 years or indefinitely.​[[27]](#c0057n00041)

Intramuscular methylprednisolone can be used as an alternative to oral corticosteroid in select patients at high risk of corticosteroid toxicity. In an RCT of 60 patients with new onset PMR, comparable remission rates were achieved but a lower cumulative glucocorticosteroid dose was used, resulting in less weight gain than with prednisone.​[[4]](#refitem-118214-37BADD19) However, the requirement for repeated appointments for administration limits the practical applicability of IM corticosteroid treatment. For managing long-term corticosteroid therapy, see [Prevention of Corticosteroid Toxicity](#c0057n00133).

### Immunomodulators and Biologic Response Modifiers

Methotrexate has been used in the treatment of PMR, primarily to minimize corticosteroid exposure.​[[28]](#c0057n00022) Evidence from 2 small RCTs suggests that methotrexate may also improve remission rates and reduce disease activity when used with corticosteroids in patients with newly diagnosed PMR.​[[29]](#c0057n00046) Methotrexate may be considered on an individual basis in specific patients with significant risk for corticosteroid toxicity due to concomitant medications and/or comorbidities. It may also be considered in those unable to wean below 7.5 mg of prednisone daily and/or in patients with frequent relapses.​[[4]](#refitem-118214-37BADD19)​[[24]](#refitem-1182131-38C68D8A)​[[30]](#refitem-1182131-38B2CF14)

Other immunomodulators, including azathioprine and leflunomide, may have corticosteroid-sparing properties, but further large-scale studies are required.​[[31]](#c0057n00021)​[[32]](#refitem-1182133-3A3F6144)

Studies of biologic therapies such as infliximab and etanercept that suggest a benefit either have inadequate follow-up or are too small to be definitive.​[[33]](#c0057n00047)​[[34]](#c0057n00072) Larger controlled studies of both drugs did not confirm benefit in the treatment of PMR.​[[35]](#c0057n00131)​[[36]](#c0057n00068) The use of infliximab and etanercept are not recommended for use in PMR.​[[24]](#refitem-1182131-38C68D8A)

An open study of 10 patients treated with monthly IV tocilizumab reported favourable results; of the 9 patients who completed therapy, all were able to wean off corticosteroids by 4 months and all remained in remission throughout the 15-month study.​[[37]](#LallyForbess) In another prospective open-label study, patients with recent-onset PMR given tocilizumab without glucocorticosteroids had reduced disease activity scores at 12 weeks.​[[38]](#refitem-1182139-38C418BC) The results of both trials are promising but randomized controlled trials are warranted.

### Giant-Cell Arteritis

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Corticosteroids

GCA requires higher doses of corticosteroids, with an initial dose of 40–60 mg of prednisone daily.​[[39]](#c0057n00132) Alternate-day corticosteroid dosing to reduce the risk of adverse effects is not recommended, as it is associated with a higher relapse rate.​[[40]](#c0057n00049)​[[41]](#c0057n00050) Although the infusion of large doses of methylprednisolone (1000 mg daily for 3 days) has been used for the treatment of patients with impending visual loss, there is no evidence that this approach is more effective than oral prednisone.​[[42]](#c0057n00040) The chances of vision loss are reduced by prompt diagnosis and treatment,​[[20]](#c0057n00037) but once vision loss occurs, corticosteroids will not usually reverse it. Most patients require 1–2 years of therapy, although 30–50% will experience exacerbations over this period.​[[26]](#c0057n00018)​[[43]](#c0057n00019) Some patients require corticosteroids for 5–10 years​[[27]](#c0057n00041)​[[43]](#c0057n00019) or indefinitely.​[[44]](#c0057n00042) For managing long-term corticosteroid therapy, see [Prevention of Corticosteroid Toxicity](#c0057n00133).

### Antiplatelet Agents

Although there is no current evidence from RCTs,​[[45]](#refitem-1182150-3A4AAB00) retrospective studies suggest that patients who were receiving ASA (81–100 mg/day) prior to the diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) had a lower risk of ischemic events (blindness, cerebrovascular accident) following diagnosis of GCA and had a lower risk of relapse.​[[46]](#c0057n00089)​[[47]](#c0057n00087)​[[48]](#refitem-1182151-3A4BE452) However, 2 subsequent studies and a meta-analysis did not confirm this protective effect.​[[49]](#Narvaez2008)​[[50]](#Berger2009)​[[51]](#Martinez2014) Thus, consideration of using antiplatelet therapy should be restricted to select patients (e.g., patients who present with visual symptoms) and weighed against the patient’s risk of bleeding. Although there are no data to suggest a recommended duration of ASA therapy, it is reasonable to continue for 4–6 weeks until the clinical and laboratory indicators of systemic inflammation have normalized and the risk of vision loss has abated. Cytoprotection with a **PPI** or **misoprostol** during concomitant prednisone and ASA therapy may reduce the risk of GI toxicity.​[[52]](#c0057n00092)

### Immunomodulators and Biologic Response Modifiers

Two out of 3 placebo-controlled studies​[[53]](#c0057n00023)​[[54]](#c0057n00044)​[[55]](#c0057n00045) of methotrexate did not detect a statistically significant benefit in patients with GCA. However, a meta-analysis of the data from the same 3 studies found that adjunctive therapy with methotrexate lowered the risk of relapse and reduced exposure to corticosteroids.​[[56]](#c0057n00070) These drugs should be considered only in patients with significant corticosteroid toxicity, those unable to wean below 7.5 mg of prednisone daily and/or in patients with frequent relapses.

Biologic agents may be considered in resistant cases of GCA.​[[57]](#c0057n00119)​[[58]](#c0057n00120)​[[59]](#c0057n00121)​[[60]](#Langford) Randomized double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials in patients with GCA demonstrated that tocilizumab given in combination with oral corticosteroid was superior to corticosteroid alone in inducing and maintaining remission.​[[61]](#Stone)​[[62]](#Villiger2016)​[[63]](#Stone2019) In a small, randomized controlled trial, the addition of abatacept to prednisone reduced rates of relapse.​[[60]](#Langford)Adalimumab has been studied with mixed results.​[[64]](#refitem-1182162-3A52E1D9) Other drugs studied, including rituximab​[[57]](#c0057n00119) and etanercept,​[[65]](#c0057n00071)​[[66]](#c0057n00048) may have steroid-sparing properties or reduce the risk of relapse but further quality studies are required. Consult a rheumatologist for initiation of an immunomodulating or biologic agent. For more information on immunomodulating and biologic agents, see Rheumatoid Arthritis.

### Prevention of Corticosteroid Toxicity

Since corticosteroids are associated with significant side effects, the lowest dose of corticosteroid needed to control symptoms should be used for the shortest period of time possible in order to minimize toxicity. Treatment with prednisone at both high daily and high cumulative doses increases the risk of fracture. Bisphosphonates prevent the bone loss associated with corticosteroid use and should be prescribed in patients commencing high-dose corticosteroid therapy, i.e., initial dose of prednisone ≥30 mg/day and cumulative dose >5 g in 1 year (see Osteoporosis).​[[67]](#refitem-1182142-38CA74DE) The risk of major osteoporotic fracture calculated with the FRAX tool should be increased by 1.15, and the risk of hip fracture by 1.2, if the prednisone dose is >7.5 mg/day.​[[67]](#refitem-1182142-38CA74DE) Weight-bearing exercises, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake to 1–2 drinks/day, and calcium (1200 mg total intake daily, preferably through dietary intake) and vitamin D (800–2000 units daily) also reduce the risk of osteoporosis and should be prescribed in conjunction with bisphosphonates (see Osteoporosis).

### Therapeutic Tips

- Prompt diagnosis and initiation of **corticosteroid** therapy is critical for the prevention of vision loss in patients with giant-cell arteritis. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting a temporal artery biopsy, which can still be positive up to 4 weeks after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy.
- Patients may report a transient increase in musculoskeletal symptoms after each corticosteroid dose reduction. These symptoms usually subside spontaneously over the ensuing week and do not necessarily represent a disease flare.
- The ESR and CRP usually parallel disease activity in patients with PMR and GCA. These tests can be used to confirm the clinical suspicion of a disease flare but should not be used in isolation to make treatment decisions.
- Reduction in shoulder range of motion may occur in some patients with PMR due to a localized rotator cuff tendonitis or capsulitis. This is more likely to occur when there has been a delay in diagnosis and initiation of therapy. A **corticosteroid injection** (e.g., methylprednisolone acetate) of the subacromial bursa or glenohumeral joint is often helpful.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Monitoring of Therapy | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antiplatelet Agents**

| ASA Aspirin , Coated Aspirin , generics < $ 10 | GCA : 81 mg daily PO, starting immediately following diagnosis | Gastritis, gastric/duodenal ulceration, bronchospasm (rare). Nausea, vomiting, GI hemorrhage, tinnitus, vertigo, hypersensitivity. |  | Increased risk of bleeding when coadministered with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, NSAIDs and SSRI s. | Cytoprotection with a proton pump inhibitor or misoprostol during concomitant prednisone and ASA therapy may reduce the risk of GI toxicity. |

**Drug Class: Corticosteroids**

| prednisone generics < $ 10 | PMR : 15 mg daily PO × 2 wk. Taper as follows: 12.5 mg daily PO × 2 wk, 10 mg daily PO × 4 wk, then decrease daily prednisone dose by 1 mg each month until completion GCA : 40– 60 mg daily PO × 4 wk. Taper as follows: decrease daily dose by 5 mg each wk until the dose is 10 mg daily. Then taper the daily dose more gradually by 1 mg each month until completion | Acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain, mood swings and agitation, cataracts, myopathy, hypertension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of large joints, adrenal suppression, increased susceptibility to infection. Monitor BMD every 1–3 y (sooner if high dose or history of fracture).​ [67] | Blood pressure, vision changes and weight gain. Ensure regular clinical assessments to look for recurrence of the original symptoms while concurrently checking CBC , ESR and CRP during the prednisone taper. An isolated rise in ESR or CRP is usually not sufficient justification to increase the dose of corticosteroids. If a disease flare occurs, increase the dose of prednisone to the lowest level that was previously effective in controlling the disease. Maintain at that level for 1 month, then taper as before. | Barbiturates, phenytoin and rifampin decrease corticosteroid effect. | Avoid alternate-day corticosteroid dosing, as it is associated with a higher rate of relapse.​ [40] ​ [41] Immunomodulating agents may be required in some cases. |
| methylprednisolone acetate Depo-Medrol , generics < $ 10 /dose | PMR Initial dose 120 mg IM × 4 doses (wk 0, 3, 6, 9), then 100 mg IM monthly; reduce the dose by 20 mg Q12 wk until wk 48, then reduce by 20 mg Q16 wk until discontinuation | Acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain, mood swings and agitation, cataracts, myopathy, hypertension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of large joints, adrenal suppression, increased susceptibility to infection. Monitor BMD every 1–3 y (sooner if high dose or history of fracture).​ [67] | Blood pressure, vision changes and weight gain. Ensure regular clinical assessments to look for recurrence of the original symptoms while concurrently checking CBC , ESR and CRP during the prednisone taper. An isolated rise in ESR or CRP is usually not sufficient justification to increase the dose of corticosteroids. If a disease flare occurs, increase the dose of prednisone to the lowest level that was previously effective in controlling the disease. Maintain at that level for 1 month, then taper as before. | Barbiturates, phenytoin and rifampin decrease corticosteroid effect. | Consider in individual cases where a lower cumulative glucocorticoid dose is desired (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, glaucoma). |

**Drug Class: Immunomodulators**

| methotrexate Metoject , generics < $ 10 | 7.5–10 mg weekly PO, IM or SC; taper after glucocorticoid discontinuation | Nausea, malaise, flulike aches, headache, oral ulcers, transient loose stools, bone marrow and liver toxicity (rare), pneumonitis (rare), immunosuppression, malignancy (rare). Not to be used in patients with hepatitis B or C, renal insufficiency or lung disease. | Baseline CBC , LFTs , albumin, creatinine, hepatitis B and C serology, chest x-ray monthly × 3 months, then Q1–3 months. Consider HIV screening in high-risk patients. LFTs monthly if also on leflunomide. Folic acid or folinic acid 5–7 mg/wk or 1 mg daily given to reduce GI adverse effects, liver toxicity, mouth sores. | Alcohol restriction may minimize hepatotoxicity. Concomitant use of NSAIDs or penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, cloxacillin, piperacillin) does not result in clinically meaningful increase in low-dose MTX serum concentrations.​ [68] Sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) may decrease MTX clearance. Avoid high-dose sulfonamides; for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci with TMP/SMX, monitor CBC , LFTs and SCr at baseline with follow-up monthly. | Off-label use; consider for use in patients at risk of glucocorticoid toxicity. |
| tocilizumab Actemra $390/dose | Dosing for IV administration: 8 mg/kg Q4 wk IV, infused over 1 h Dosing for SC administration: 162 mg SC weekly or every other wk | Infusion reactions (very severe reactions resulting in death have been reported rarely), serious infections, GI perforation, increased neutrophils, decreased platelets, neutropenia, elevated ALT, increased lipids. | Baseline CBC, LFTs, creatinine, hepatitis B and C serology, PPD and chest x-ray to assess for latent TB. Monitor for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated aminotransferases 4–8 wk after starting therapy. | May increase CYP450 enzyme activity—monitor concurrent therapy with drugs metabolized by CYP450. | Off-label use; consider for use in patients at risk of glucocorticoid toxicity. Contraindicated in active infection. Screen for latent/active TB before initiating therapy. |
