### Introduction

A red eye is common in a wide variety of ocular conditions and signals inflammation. The majority of these conditions are benign, and many are self-limited, but some can have serious consequences. For example, conjunctivitis can be the initial presenting sign of COVID-19, which can be potentially fatal.​[[1]](#WuPDuanFLuoCEtAlCharacteristicsOfO-F9CEA37A) [Table 1](#c0019n00018) lists minor and major/serious causes of red eye. The presence of 1 or more warning signs (see [Table 2](#c0019n00012)) requires immediate referral to an ophthalmologist or an optometrist if an ophthalmologist is not available.

Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye.​[[2]](#c0019n00386) Differentiating between the various causes of acute conjunctivitis is clinically very difficult with few tests to help. The majority of infectious (caused by viruses or bacteria) or noninfectious (due to an allergic reaction or drug toxicity) cases of conjunctivitis can be treated in primary care but certain cases require referral to a specialist (see [Table 3](#c0019n00385)).

**Table 1:** Etiology of Red Eye

| Cause | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Infection | Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Acute (e.g., bacterial, viral) Chronic (nasolacrimal duct obstruction) Keratitis (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, other [contact lens–related]) Blepharitis with secondary conjunctivitis/keratitis |
| Allergy | Seasonal, keratoconjunctivitis (atopic, vernal), contact lens–related (giant papillary conjunctivitis or GPC) |
| Ocular inflammation | Iritis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, corneal infiltrate/ulcer Related to systemic diseases (e.g., Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis) |
| Glaucoma | Acute angle-closure glaucoma (see Glaucoma ) |
| Dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) | Sjögren syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)/ocular rosacea (see Rosacea ), other |
| Eyelid condition | Blepharitis, hordeolum (stye), chalazion, meibomian gland dysfunction; entropion, ectropion, lagophthalmos |
| Toxic/chemical/other irritants | Ophthalmic medications, contact lens solutions, acids/alkalis, smoke, wind, UV light (e.g., tanning bed, welder's arc) |
| Traumatic injury | Corneal abrasions, foreign bodies, blunt trauma with hyphema (bleeding into the anterior chamber), heat exposure |
| Ocular manifestations of skin condition | Herpes zoster, herpes simplex (with lid, conjunctival and/or corneal involvement) Rosacea (blepharitis, dry eye; see Rosacea ) Steven Johnson syndrome, psoriasis |
| Other | Subconjunctival hemorrhage, inflamed pterygium or pinguecula |

### Goals of Therapy

- Preserve eyesight
- Prevent structural damage to the eye
- Control and prevent spread of infection
- Control inflammation
- Provide symptomatic relief

### Investigations

An algorithm for assessment and management of red eye is presented in [Figure 1](#AssessmentOfRedEye-AFE9B525) and [Figure 2](#c0019n00001). The presence of 1 or more warning signs (see [Table 2](#c0019n00012)) requires immediate referral to an ophthalmologist.

Thorough history to determine:

- Unilateral or bilateral eye involvement
- Duration and type of symptoms
- Type of discharge
- Visual changes
- Pain and photophobia
- Allergies
- Contact lens wear
- Trauma
- Ocular and systemic medications; history of drug use, smoking/vaping
- Previous eye diseases and treatment
- Other relevant medical history, including recent upper respiratory tract infection, fever, chills or rash; dermatologic and autoimmune conditions

Physical examination:

- Best corrected visual acuity with pinhole if glasses are not available
- Pupil size and reaction to light
- Inspection of face, eyelids, conjunctiva (to determine type and extent of hyperemia), sclera, cornea (staining with fluorescein)
- Globe tenderness by digital pressure through the lids
- Preauricular adenopathy
- Intraocular pressure if acute glaucoma is suspected

**Table 2:** Warning Signs for Ophthalmologist Referral

| Marked redness of the eye —limbal/ciliary injection (redness dominant at the corneoscleral junction), especially unilateral involvement White corneal opacity or corneal haze (with or without fluorescein staining) Moderate/severe pain with photophobia or globe tenderness —not relieved by test dose of topical anesthetic drop (proparacaine, tetracaine); possible acute angle-closure glaucoma (more common in older adults), corneal erosion/infiltrate/ulcer, iritis or scleritis Reduced visual acuity —Snellen chart using a pin hole; possible iritis, corneal ulcer, glaucoma (coloured halos around lights) Pupil abnormalities (miotic or mid-dilated and fixed, irregular, sluggish to light, painful pupillary constriction) Recent trauma to eye including ocular surgery, foreign body (e.g., hammering metal on metal), chemical exposure Contact lens wear (corneal infiltrate/ulcer) History of iritis/scleritis/angle-closure glaucoma —check for underlying systemic disease; history of contact lens–related ulcer, recurrent corneal erosion, chronic conjunctivitis (unilateral or bilateral) with duration >3 weeks Suspected serious infectious causes: COVID-19—conjunctivitis alone or with fever, cough and shortness of breath Chlamydia—preauricular node and purulent conjunctivitis plus history of sexual contact Gonococcal—hyperacute conjunctivitis Herpes simplex—usually unilateral, watery discharge and preauricular node (differential diagnosis is viral, i.e., adenovirus), eyelid vesicles Herpes zoster—ocular involvement (usually eyelids, conjunctiva), facial vesicles, corneal complication, uveitis Neonatal conjunctivitis—usually due to Chlamydial or Gonococcal infection; may also occur due to chemical toxicity secondary to prophylactic medications instilled at birth |

**Table 3:** Diagnosing Conjunctivitis

| History | Exposure to person with red eye Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) Exposure to a person with possible COVID-19 Past history of conjunctivitis, blepharitis, styes Discharge, type and duration, purulent with morning crusting or watery History of atopic allergies, atopic disease Exposure to ophthalmic medications, chemicals Contact lens wear |
| Signs | Normal pupillary reaction Discharge and/or excessive tearing Lid and conjunctival edema Conjunctival redness Distinguishing bacterial from adenoviral conjunctivitis is clinically very difficult but a point-of-care adenoviral test, AdenoPlus, is available for health-care practitioners to use in office as a helpful diagnostic test;​ [3] Viral: more common in adults; often presents as a very red eye with swollen lids, conjunctival membranes and subconjunctival hemorrhages Bacterial: more common in children and is usually associated with a purulent discharge, often from one eye;​ [4] ​ [5] common pathogens seen in adults and children include Haemophilus influenzae , Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae ; Moraxella catarrhalis may occasionally cause conjunctivitis, mainly in the pediatric population​ [5] |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Treatment of red eye depends on the history, symptom presentation and working diagnosis as shown in [Figure 1](#AssessmentOfRedEye-AFE9B525) and [Figure 2](#c0019n00001).

Instruct patient to:

- Stop wearing contact lenses until the problem is resolved; once resolved, reassess contact lens fit and hygiene practices
- Avoid makeup, smoke, wind and other irritants
- Discard potentially contaminated eye products, including makeup
- Prevent spread through fastidious hand washing, separating towels, and avoiding school or work until infection improves (3–7 days viral) or 24 hours after starting antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis
- Apply cold compresses for allergic or viral conjunctivitis
- Apply warm compresses for bacterial conjunctivitis to help remove crusts, styes or chalazion to reduce swelling:

  - apply 2–3 times a day for 5–10 minutes followed by gentle massage over the lesion
- Practise lid hygiene for blepharitis:

  - place warm compresses on closed eyelids 1–2 times a day for 10 minutes (e.g., via a gel mask), followed by gentle rubbing of lid margins with warm water; a commercial eyelid wipe can also be used after the compress

### Pharmacologic Choices

Once major/serious conditions are ruled out, treatment can be initiated. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying cause (see [Figure 2](#c0019n00001) as well as [Table 4](#c0019n00326), [Table 5](#c0019n00017), [Table 6](#c0019n00328), [Table 7](#c0019n00329) and ).

Viral conjunctivitis does not usually require treatment;​[[4]](#c0019n00432) however, cold compresses and ocular lubricants may be used.

Since most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and benign, broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops are usually not required, but may result in a modest shortening of recovery time.​[[6]](#c0019n00387)​[[7]](#ShekhawatNSShteinRMBlachleyTSEtAlA-053CBF8B) Ophthalmic corticosteroids and antibiotic/corticosteroid combinations should be avoided.​[[7]](#ShekhawatNSShteinRMBlachleyTSEtAlA-053CBF8B) All ophthalmic antibiotics appear to have similar efficacy.​[[6]](#c0019n00387) Whether treated or not, if no improvement is seen after 3–5 days, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. Patients presenting with chronic, unilateral conjunctivitis should be referred to an ophthalmologist for investigation of a retained foreign body or nasolacrimal duct obstruction, which may create a reservoir for bacteria.

Reserve ophthalmic vasoconstrictors (naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, phenylephrine) for occasional and short-term use (e.g., ≤3–4 times per month and ≤3 days in a row) to provide relief of symptoms such as redness, edema (allergic or viral conjunctivitis) or minor eye irritation. Overuse of these products may cause rebound hyperemia and/or tachyphylaxis. Brimonidine, a selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist typically used for glaucoma, is available without a prescription in a lower concentration (0.025%) for the treatment of red eye. Based on limited preliminary evidence, brimonidine does not appear to cause significant rebound hyperemia or tachyphylaxis.​[[8]](#AckermanSLTokildsenGLMcLaurinEEtAl.-AEDF4C86)​[[9]](#HostenLOSnyderC.Over-the-counterOcu-AEDF7F06)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Most topically administered eye medications are capable of causing irritation or toxicity as an adverse effect.
- Some patients may react to preservatives in artificial tears and other ophthalmic products. Lubricants without preservatives are available as minims (single-dose preservative-free containers) or in multidose bottles. These formulations are preferable for patients who require drops more than 4–5 times daily for dry eye disease, those with allergic conjunctivitis or those who experience eye irritation with preserved medication.​[[10]](#c0019n00448) Moxifloxacin is a non-preserved topical antibiotic.
- Use of ophthalmic corticosteroids may cause glaucoma and/or cataracts; the risk increases with prolonged use.
- Ophthalmic corticosteroids and antibiotic/corticosteroid combinations may worsen herpetic/fungal keratitis and should be used only under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause keratitis, corneal melting and perforation in patients who have pre-existing corneal disease and, in these cases, should be used under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.​[[11]](#KimSJFlachAJJampolLMNonsteroidalAn-01070260)
- Topical decongestants/vasoconstrictors may provoke angle-closure glaucoma in patients who are predisposed (see Glaucoma).
- Topical anesthetic eye drops should never be prescribed for self-administration by the patient.
