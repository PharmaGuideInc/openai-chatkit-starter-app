### Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) occurs in 50–80% of pregnancies.​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189)​[[2]](#2018ACOG29266076) Despite the common term “morning sickness,” nausea and vomiting may occur at any time of day and may be constant throughout the day. Virtually all women who develop NVP have some symptoms by 9 weeks’ gestation, and more than half have symptoms by 6 weeks.​[[3]](#psc1030n00058) For the vast majority of women, the symptoms subside by 16 weeks; however, approximately 10% of women have NVP that persists beyond 20 weeks’ gestation.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a serious condition occurring in up to 2% of pregnant women.​[[3]](#psc1030n00058) It is characterized by intractable vomiting, beginning in the first trimester and possibly continuing throughout the pregnancy. The vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, nutritional deficiency and weight loss. This condition can threaten the survival of the fetus and the mother and requires early identification and treatment; hospitalization and IV therapy may be required. Such symptoms must also prompt investigation for specific diseases such as multiple-gestation pregnancy, molar pregnancy, urinary tract infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, thyrotoxicosis and hepatitis.​[[3]](#psc1030n00058) Hyperemesis gravidarum is typically diagnosed when other possible causes of nausea and vomiting have been ruled out.

### Goals of Therapy

- Eliminate nausea and vomiting; if not possible, reduce severity, frequency and duration as much as possible
- Prevent complications of nausea and vomiting
- Prevent recurrence of nausea and vomiting
- Decrease time off work and lifestyle disruptions caused by nausea and vomiting
- Correct any consequences of persistent nausea (with or without vomiting), such as electrolyte abnormalities or nutritional compromise

### Investigations

Assess and treat NVP in all pregnancies to avoid significant medical and psychosocial morbidity resulting in disruption of work, home life, relationships, nutritional status and well-being. Consider other causes of nausea and vomiting not due to pregnancy as in the nonpregnant patient. A full assessment is especially appropriate for pregnant women who first experience nausea and vomiting after the first trimester or have additional symptoms such as pain or fever, which do not normally accompany NVP.

NVP may be described as mild, moderate or severe based upon the following parameters:​[[4]](#Attard2002)

- Mild: ≤1 hour of nausea with ≤2 instances of vomiting and retching/day
- Moderate: ≤6 hours of nausea with ≤2 instances of vomiting and retching/day
- Severe: >6 hours of nausea, vomiting or retching with >5 occasions/day

Alternatively, the modified pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) scoring index incorporates quality of life measurements into the severity grading by considering the patient’s perception of symptoms (see [Table 1](#mPUQE)).​[[5]](#Lacasse2008)

**Table 1:** Modified Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea​[[5]](#Lacasse2008)

| 7 or more times | 5–6 times | 3–4 times | 1–2 times | None |
| (5) | (4) | (3) | (2) | (1) |
| 3. On average in a day, how many times do you have retching or dry heaves without bringing anything up? |
| None | 1–2 times | 3–4 times | 5–6 times | 7 or more times |
| (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
| Total score (sum of replies to 1, 2 and 3): mild NVP ≤6; moderate NVP 7–12; severe NVP ≥13 |

History:

- Ascertain the frequency and severity of nausea as well as the timing in relation to meals, time of day, emotions or stresses
- Clarify the relationship between nausea and vomiting; if vomiting is occurring, determine the amount and nature of the vomitus
- Determine whether the nausea is related to pregnancy or other causes
- Explore possible underlying causes, and whether they are simple or complex, acute, or chronic
- Complete an appropriate GI functional inquiry including frequency and nature of bowel movements, early satiety, postprandial symptoms, abdominal pain, or weight loss
- Identify other symptoms, e.g., headache, pain, vertigo
- Inquire about diet history, including any new foods, food allergies or intolerances, and whether potentially contaminated food has been consumed
- Establish any exposure to or other symptoms of infection such as gastroenteritis or exposure to others who are ill
- Inquire about past history of migraine headaches, endocrine disorders and malignancy
- Obtain a thorough medication history, including use of prescription, nonprescription, herbal or recreational drugs (including cannabis) as well as alcohol, nutritional supplements and vitamins
- Inquire about recent changes to drug regimens (dosages changed, therapies added or discontinued) and correlation with nausea
- Explore possible psychosocial stressors, conflicts, and sources of emotional pain or loss
- Explore the patient’s illness experience by inquiring about feelings, concerns, ideas, functional impairment and expectations of treatment
- Determine the patient’s desire for pharmacologic therapy

Physical examination:

- Vital signs including BP, pulse, respiratory rate and temperature
- Determine severity and consequences of symptoms—assess hydration, including jugular venous pressure (JVP), mucous membranes, skin turgor, and postural changes in blood pressure and heart rate
- If no specific cause is identified in the history, use the physical exam to rule out other potential causes, e.g., abdominal mass
- Assess systems related to the probable underlying cause when apparent, e.g., perform neurologic exam for a migraine patient, examine for bowel obstruction if the patient has a malignancy or is postsurgical, check for nystagmus in vertigo-associated nausea, and inspect fundi for papilledema
- In the second and third trimester, assess the fetus by intermittent auscultation or via a non-stress test. If fetal compromise is suspected, conduct a biophysical profile

Other investigations, if indicated by the history and physical exam:

- Metabolic panel if metabolic disturbances are suspected, e.g., test for hypercalcemia in a patient with a malignancy, glucose in a diabetic patient, hypokalemia or hyponatremia in a patient on diuretics, and serum lipase/amylase levels if pancreatitis is suspected
- CBC and differential if an infective cause is suspected
- Serum creatinine to determine whether there is a renal cause
- Drug levels, e.g., digoxin, anticonvulsants
- Liver function tests
- Thyroid function or fasting cortisol levels to rule out endocrine disorders
- Ultrasound evaluation of the pregnancy for multiple, molar or ectopic pregnancy if not yet determined
- Ultrasound of the liver, gallbladder or pancreas
- Abdominal x-ray if a bowel obstruction is suspected or an upper GI x-ray series with motility studies if gastroesophageal reflux or gastroparesis is suspected. X-ray must be carefully evaluated for benefit to the mother versus risk to the fetus; this decision-making should take into account the patient’s preferences
- Upper GI endoscopy or CT of the abdomen. Imaging intervention and CT must be carefully evaluated for benefit to the mother versus risk to the fetus; this decision-making should take into account the patient’s preferences
- CT of the head if an intracranial cause is suspected

### Therapeutic Choices

There is insufficient evidence to recommend one pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention over another for the management of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.​[[6]](#c0111n00237)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Reassure patients that most mild to moderate forms of nausea and vomiting are normal, not harmful to the fetus and usually subside as the pregnancy progresses.

In patients with frequent vomiting, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte status orally or intravenously is essential.

Women may eat any pregnancy-safe foods they find appealing. Due to risk of bacterial contamination, pregnant women should avoid raw or undercooked meat, fish, eggs, or sprouts and unpasteurized dairy products or juices.​[[7]](#GOCHealthyEating) Although evidence is limited, the following dietary measures may reduce the symptoms of NVP and should be recommended to patients:​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189)​[[2]](#2018ACOG29266076)

- Eat small, bland, frequent meals and avoid fatty, fried or spicy foods
- Eat at times of the day when nausea is less severe
- Eat before getting out of bed in the morning to help prevent early morning nausea
- Avoid strong food odours
- Separate solid and liquid consumption; drink small amounts of fluid regularly between meals

Prenatal vitamins may worsen nausea, primarily due to the iron content as well as the large size of tablets. In the first trimester, women can take folic acid alone and choose a multivitamin that is low in iron.​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189)

Lifestyle modifications that may alleviate NVP include avoiding feeling too warm, increasing rest, reducing work hours and reducing stress.​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189)

Acupuncture and P6 acupressure have been the subject of numerous trials for NVP. P6 is also known as Nei Guan (“inner guard”) and is the sixth point along the pericardium meridian. P6 is anatomically located about 5 cm proximal to the distal crease of the wrist, between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis of either forearm (see [Figure 1](#psc1030n00012)). The point can be stimulated with the tip of a finger, with or without moderate-pressure massaging. There is no consensus regarding how long or how often to apply the pressure, but some practitioners recommend 5 minutes of pressure every 4 hours. Patients may be taught to do this themselves or they can apply pressure by wearing an acupressure wristband, an elasticized band with a protruding button that is placed over the acupressure point. Some studies (in motion sickness) have shown less efficacy with wristbands than with manual pressure because the wristbands tend to slip out of position. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture or acupressure at P6 have shown equivocal results.​[[6]](#c0111n00237) While acupressure has not been clearly shown to be better than dietary or lifestyle advice or “dummy” acupressure, the manual application of acupressure is harmless and without cost.​[[8]](#psc1030n00074)

### Pharmacologic Choices

An algorithm for the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is presented in [Figure 2](#AlgorithmNVP).

The best available evidence suggests that ginger​[[9]](#Lindblad2016)​[[10]](#c0111n00212)​[[11]](#c0111n00213) and pyridoxine are likely beneficial for mild NVP.​[[12]](#c0111n00238)​[[13]](#2018Sharifzadeh28629250) A product containing pyridoxine in combination with an antihistamine (doxylamine-pyridoxine) is the only medication specifically approved for the treatment of NVP in Canada; however, its use is controversial. A re-evaluation of the efficacy evidence​[[14]](#Koren2010) to include previously unpublished data​[[15]](#Zhang2017) was performed in 2018 and found no benefit of doxylamine-pyridoxine versus placebo for the treatment of NVP.​[[16]](#Persuad2018) The authors concluded that clinical practice and guidelines should be updated to reflect the evidence; however, the combination product remains first-line therapy for many.​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189) Given the lack of clinical efficacy of the combination, a trial of single-entity pyridoxine is a reasonable evidence-based approach to NVP prior to considering the combination.

Expert opinion suggests that first-line options for moderate to severe NVP include dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine and promethazine; second-line agents include chlorpromazine, methylprednisolone, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine.​[[1]](#2016Campbell27986189)​[[17]](#c0111n00240)​[[18]](#Tan2016)​[[19]](#Oliveira2014) Reserve corticosteroids for the treatment of resistant cases of NVP after the first trimester. Limit metoclopramide therapy to 5 days since it may cause oculogyric crisis.​[[17]](#c0111n00240)

While ondansetron does not appear to be associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes,​[[20]](#Carstairs2016)​[[21]](#2018Lavecchia29754832) safety concerns may limit its use in NVP to refractory cases and hyperemesis gravidarum. A 2018 retrospective cohort study of 1.8 million pregnancies found a small increased risk of oral clefts in infants exposed to ondansetron in the first trimester, but no association to cardiac malformations or congenital malformations overall after accounting for confounding variables.​[[22]](#Huybrechts2018) Based upon this data, Health Canada released safety labelling updates in 2020 recommending against use of ondansetron in pregnancy;​[[23]](#HealthCanadaOndansetron) however, the challenges of adequately managing patients with NVP and hyperemesis gravidarum are such that ondansetron will likely still be used clinically in treatment of these patients. The risk of oral clefts and the conflicting evidence regarding the potential for cardiac malformations must be carefully explained to pregnant women considering ondansetron therapy.

The literature shows that rates of marijuana use in pregnancy are increasing,​[[24]](#Young-Wolff2018) and the legalization of cannabis/marijuana in Canada in October of 2018 creates the potential for more women to consider the use of this substance in treating NVP. It is important to discuss cannabis use with patients presenting with NVP, as reports suggest prenatal cannabis use may actually contribute to NVP​[[24]](#Young-Wolff2018) and chronic use can result in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.​[[25]](#Richards2018)​[[26]](#Hernandez2018) In addition to the effect on NVP, cannabinoids cross the placenta and impact the developing fetus. In utero exposure to cannabis has been linked to withdrawal-like syndrome in newborns (e.g., increase in startles and tremors) and has been associated with long-term effects on neurologic development in children that present at preschool age (e.g., lower scores on language, memory and abstract/visual reasoning), which persists into young adulthood (e.g., impaired working memory, inattention, impulsivity and inability to plan). While the evidence is limited, cannabis use has also been associated with low birth weights, stillbirth, spontaneous preterm birth and admission to neonatal intensive care. Health Canada advises that cannabis is not recommended in women of childbearing age who are not on a reliable contraceptive or who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning a pregnancy.​[[27]](#HealthCanadaPregnancy)​[[28]](#Conner2016)​[[29]](#Gunn2016)​[[30]](#Metz2018)

### Choices during Breastfeeding

The agents used in pregnancy are also considered safe for use while breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in this population can be found in Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in this appendix.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Discussing treatment options for NVP and providing a prescription for an antiemetic at the patient’s first visit (e.g., confirmation of pregnancy, initial prenatal appointment) can help to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms as well as the impact on the patient’s quality of life.
- For moderate-severe NVP, combination antiemetic therapy may be required.
- Severe NVP may result in dehydration; IV fluid replacement may be needed in some cases where oral fluids are not tolerated.
