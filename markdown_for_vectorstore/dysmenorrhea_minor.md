### Reproductive Physiology

Female reproductive physiology revolves around the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle can be divided into three sections. The first phase occurs on day 1 of the cycle and is known as menstruation. The second phase is the follicular/proliferative phase. In this part of the cycle estradiol is released through stimulation of the follicles in the ovaries and this results in the proliferation of endometrial tissue.​[[1]](#psc1181n1001) The last phase of the menstrual cycle is the luteal/secretory phase. During this part of the cycle the corpus luteum produces progesterone which stimulates glandular cells in the endometrium to produce glycogen, mucus and prostaglandins. These changes in the endometrial tissue are known as secretory changes. The amount of endometrial tissue produced and the amount of prostaglandin released during menses have a role to play in primary dysmenorrhea. For a more detailed description of reproductive physiology see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods.

### Pathophysiology

Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstruation, and can be primary or secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea is attributed to uterine contractions with no underlying pathology, whereas secondary dysmenorrhea is due to pelvic disease such as endometriosis, inflammatory disease or uterine polyps.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002) The main focus of this chapter is primary dysmenorrhea.

### Prevalence

The reported prevalence of dysmenorrhea ranges from 6–90%, with the most common being 50%.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003) The peak incidence is in women between 17 and 22 years of age, and it decreases with age.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002) Dysmenorrhea is the most common cause of missed school or workdays in young women. Approximately 15% of women will suffer from severe symptoms.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003)

### Etiology

Dysmenorrhea occurs as prostaglandins are released from lysing endometrial cells in the luteal phase of an ovulatory cycle. During anovulatory cycles, the endometrial tissue contains smaller amounts of prostaglandins; therefore, these cycles are usually painless.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002) Prostaglandins have a direct effect on the endometrium and surrounding tissues, resulting in the signs and symptoms of dysmenorrhea.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002)

The role of prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of dysmenorrhea is well established. Women with dysmenorrhea have higher concentrations of PGF2-alpha and PGE2 in their menstrual fluid than women who do not complain of pain on menstruation.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002) Moreover, administering these prostaglandins by infusion induces the same discomfort and symptoms experienced by women with dysmenorrhea.

Women with dysmenorrhea have increased uterine activity, resulting in increased resting tone, increased strength and frequency of contractions, and/or dysrhythmic contractions.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002)

Dysmenorrhea usually begins 6–12 months after menarche and occurs only with ovulatory cycles. It tends to decrease with age and after childbirth.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003)​[[4]](#psc1181n1025)

### Risk Factors

Age, parity and oral contraceptive use are inversely associated with dysmenorrhea. Stress and family history of dysmenorrhea appear to be risk factors. There is inconclusive evidence for other reported risk factors such as smoking, obesity, diet, depression and abuse.​[[4]](#psc1181n1025)

### Clinical Presentation

The diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is based on the presence of symptoms, a normal pelvic exam and the patient’s response to therapy.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003) Individuals who do not respond to a proven therapy (e.g., NSAIDS or oral contraceptives) should be investigated for causes of secondary dysmenorrhea.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002) Menstrual pain occurs a few hours before or just after menstruation begins and usually lasts for 48–72 hours. The pain is described as cramping and is most intense over the lower abdomen, but it may radiate to the back and inner thighs. Associated symptoms include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and headache.​[[2]](#psc1181n1002)

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms
- Minimize time lost from work, school and other activities
- Identify patients who may have secondary dysmenorrhea and require further medical assessment

### Patient Assessment

Assess patients with dysmenorrhea to confirm that their complaints are consistent with the etiology, signs and symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea (see [Figure 1](#psc1181n00011)). Cues that additional patient evaluation is required include onset of pain more than 2 years postmenarche, symptoms that occur outside the first 3 days of menses, and changes in the severity or pattern of the pain or in the characteristics of the menstrual fluid, e.g., degree of flow, odour, colour, flow pattern. Response to a proven therapy (e.g., NSAIDs or oral contraceptives) is usually a confirmation of the diagnosis; therefore, if a trial fails, the patient requires further assessment.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 trials of self-care modalities in the management of dysmenorrhea, suggests that exercise is associated with the greatest reduction in menstrual pain.​[[5]](#Armour2019) Interestingly, regular (excluding the menstruation period), low intensity exercise such as yoga and stretching had the best level of evidence.​[[5]](#Armour2019) Similarly, a Cochrane review including 10 trials of mostly low quality, suggests that both low and high-intensity regular exercise reduces dysmenorrhea.​[[6]](#Armour2019-2) Examples of exercises that may be suggested include:

- stretching exercises in the abdominal, pelvic and groin region for 10 minutes, twice per day, 3 times per week​[[5]](#Armour2019)
- yoga stretches (e.g., cycles of Cat, Cobra, Fish poses), 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week​[[7]](#Kim2019)
- Zumba training for 60 minutes, 2 times per week.​[[8]](#Samy2019)

The relative safety and the overall health benefits of exercise make it s an attractive nonpharmacologic treatment.​[[5]](#Armour2019)​[[6]](#Armour2019-2)

Warm baths or applying a heating pad, heat patch or hot water bottle to the abdomen may reduce discomfort, though the quality of evidence is low.​[[9]](#Jo2018) In a randomized controlled study, heating pads provided pain relief equivalent to the use of ibuprofen. When both heating pads and ibuprofen were used together there was no more pain relief than with either agent used alone; however, pain relief occurred faster when both therapies were combined.​[[10]](#psc1181n1004)​[[11]](#refitem-1162111-967EA388)

Behavioural interventions such as massage relaxation therapy, biofeedback, pain management sessions and coping skills have been studied; however, good-quality trials are lacking.​[[12]](#psc1181n1005) Surgical ablation of the pelvic nerve pathways requires further study and is not recommended.​[[13]](#psc1181n1006) Spinal manipulation has not been shown to provide benefit in dysmenorrhea.​[[14]](#psc1181n1008)

High-frequency transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) may have some utility in the treatment of dysmenorrhea.​[[15]](#psc1181n1021)​[[16]](#psc1181n01044) A Cochrane systematic review (42 trials in 4640 subjects) examining the effectiveness of acupressure and acupuncture found some evidence for benefit; however, due to the low quality of studies, further investigation is needed.​[[17]](#psc1181n01036)

For most women, drug therapy is required and nonpharmacologic measures are used adjunctively.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For more information on pharmacologic management of dysmenorrhea, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Dysmenorrhea.

Pharmacologic agents that decrease the amount of prostaglandins in endometrial tissue or inhibit prostaglandin synthesis are considered first-line therapies for the treatment of dysmenorrhea.

### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics.

**Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** reduce the pain of dysmenorrhea by decreasing prostaglandin concentrations in endometrial and menstrual fluid. NSAIDs commonly used in dysmenorrhea are included in [Table 1](#d2e738).

Moderate or excellent pain relief is achieved more often with NSAIDs versus placebo.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009) Many NSAIDs have been used in the management of dysmenorrhea. Some NSAIDs have theoretical advantages in terms of site of action such as acetic acids (e.g., indomethacin), propionic acids (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and fenamates (e.g., mefenamic acid), which reduce prostaglandin concentrations in endometrial and menstrual fluid.​[[3]](#psc1181n1003) Mefenamic acid not only inhibits the formation of prostaglandins but also blocks prostaglandins at the receptor site. The clinical significance of these pharmacologic differences is questionable and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs lend little support for recommending one agent over another in terms of efficacy.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009)

The NSAID should be administered with food at the onset of pain or menses and continued for 72 hours, as the peak concentration of prostaglandins occurs in the first 48 hours.​[[19]](#psc1181n1010) An initial loading dose may help obtain faster relief of symptoms. Women who do not obtain adequate relief of symptoms may try starting NSAIDs 1 or 2 days prior to expected menses. NSAIDs should be used for 3 cycles before being declared a treatment failure.​[[20]](#psc1181n1023) If symptoms are not relieved or if pain becomes worse, refer the patient to an appropriate health-care professional for further assessment.

In terms of safety, NSAIDs have higher overall rates of adverse events (combined GI disturbance, CNS effects and hypersensitivity reactions) compared with placebo. When these events are analyzed separately, only CNS adverse effects have been shown to be statistically significant. This finding is based predominantly on 2 trials using indomethacin and naproxen.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009) Safety comparisons among NSAIDs do not indicate the superiority of any agent in this patient population.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009)

NSAIDs have well-documented drug interactions and contraindications which may not be relevant with occasional, short-term use of these agents. In dysmenorrhea, use is generally limited to 3 days; however, the risks may outweigh the benefits and professional judgment must be used.

In several studies, neither acetaminophen nor ASA was better in providing pain relief than placebo.​[[21]](#psc1181n1013)​[[22]](#psc1181n1014) Two trials have shown ASA to be inferior to indomethacin and fenoprofen in terms of pain relief.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009) Caution is advised regarding the use of ASA in adolescents or young adults because of the possible association with Reye syndrome when ASA is used for conditions such as influenza or varicella. Three trials comparing acetaminophen with NSAIDs indicate that NSAIDs provide superior pain relief in dysmenorrhea.​[[18]](#psc1181n1009) Acetaminophen may have value as additive therapy to NSAIDs and in women with intolerance or contraindications to NSAIDs.​[[23]](#psc1181n1015)

### Hormonal Contraceptives

If NSAIDs are contraindicated, if they fail or if birth control is also required, a **combined oral contraceptive** (COC) is often used to treat dysmenorrhea. COCs relieve dysmenorrhea symptoms by reducing the amount of prostaglandins in menstrual fluid (because they reduce the actual amount of fluid) and by inhibiting ovulation (dysmenorrhea occurs only in ovulatory cycles).​[[3]](#psc1181n1003) COCs are up to 90% effective in relieving dysmenorrhea symptoms.​[[24]](#psc1181n1017) This evidence is garnered from older formulations of medium- to high-dose estrogens (50–150 µg ethinyl estradiol) plus first- and second-generation progestogens (norgestrel, levonorgestrel or norethindrone). There are insufficient data on low-dose estrogens (≤35 µg ethinyl estradiol) plus first-, second- or third-generation agents (desogestrel, gestodene) or newer progestogens (drospirenone) to suggest they are as effective as the older formulations.​[[25]](#psc1181n01037) However, due to safety concerns, low-dose estrogen preparations (≤35 µg ethinyl estradiol) are currently used. Formulations containing ≥50 µg ethinyl estradiol are no longer available in Canada. Safety data for use of COCs in this specific population (women with dysmenorrhea) are lacking.​[[24]](#psc1181n1017)

According to one randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, continuous COC regimens (3 months) do not appear to offer any benefit beyond cyclic 28-day regimens.​[[26]](#psc1181n01046) While a difference in efficacy between continuous and cyclic regimens may exist, the evidence is weak.​[[27]](#refitem-1162135-969AB75F)

Comparative efficacy of NSAIDs versus COCs for treating dysmenorrhea is unknown.​[[24]](#psc1181n1017)

The combination of a COC and an NSAID may also be beneficial. About 10% of women do not respond to treatment with NSAIDs, COCs or both.​[[28]](#psc1181n1016)

**Levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine systems** (IUS) and oral and parenteral **progestogens** may have some benefit in dysmenorrhea.​[[29]](#psc1181n1018) However, larger-scale confirmatory trials are required before use can be recommended.

For further discussion of hormonal contraceptives, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Contraception.

### Other

Pamabrom is a mild diuretic that is marketed in combination with acetaminophen for relief of dysmenorrhea. There are no trials to support the use of this agent in women with dysmenorrhea.

**Beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists** have been used to treat dysmenorrhea in the past. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review examining these medications (isoxsuprine, terbutaline oral spray, ritodrine or orciprenaline) in dysmenorrhea found little evidence to support their use. Given the lack of data to support efficacy and the known side effect profile of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, they are not recommended for use in dysmenorrhea.​[[30]](#psc1181n01048)

### Natural Health Products

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Products: Single Entity; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity, Solid Combinations.

A systematic review of 27 randomized controlled trials of dietary supplements concluded that no high quality evidence exists for their use.​[[31]](#refitem-1182137-FD88BC42) Evidence for various individual supplements are discussed below.

**Cholecalciferol (**vitamin D3**)** supplementation may alleviate dysmenorrhea in women with low vitamin D levels. In a small randomized placebo-controlled trial of menstruating women with low vitamin D levels, a single oral dose of 1 mL cholecalciferol (300 000 IU/mL) 5 days before the anticipated commencement of the next menstrual cycle decreased pain intensity and the requirement for NSAID use. Further corroboration of this small trial is required.​[[32]](#psc1181n01047)

Alternative approaches for managing dysmenorrhea include magnesium supplements,​[[21]](#psc1181n1013) omega-3 fatty acids,​[[33]](#psc1181n01050) transdermal nitroglycerin, **vitamin B1**,​[[34]](#psc1181n01049)​[[31]](#refitem-1182137-FD88BC42) **vitamin B6,**  **vitamin E**,​[[31]](#refitem-1182137-FD88BC42)​[[35]](#psc1181n1019)​[[36]](#psc1181n01051) shirazi thymus vulgaris​[[37]](#psc1181n01052) and valerian root.​[[20]](#psc1181n1023)​[[31]](#refitem-1182137-FD88BC42)​[[38]](#psc1181n01053)​[[39]](#psc1181n1020) These therapies require further study to determine their role in treating dysmenorrhea.

Chinese herbal medicine (individually designed formulae or standard) has shown positive effects on pain and overall symptoms, and has reduced requirement for further medication.​[[40]](#psc1181n1022) However, the nature of these individualized treatments and variations among the agents used in trials poses difficulty in evaluating Chinese herbal medicines. While the quality of current studies precludes recommendation of these therapies, further investigation seems warranted.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Efficacy: If a patient fails to respond to a 3-cycle trial of an NSAID and/or a combined oral contraceptive in conjunction with nonpharmacologic measures, further assessment is required.

Safety: Inform patients taking medication for dysmenorrhea about common adverse effects and the timeframe associated with them. Instruct patients to report any signs of serious adverse effects to their health-care practitioner.
