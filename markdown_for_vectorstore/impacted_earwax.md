### Pathophysiology

Earwax is produced in the outer two-thirds of the external auditory canal (EAC) and is composed of a mixture of cerumen, sebum, desquamated epithelium and other foreign particulates.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[2]](#Michaudet) It is a natural emollient that protects and cleans the EAC and is usually cleared from the ear naturally through self-cleaning mechanisms assisted by the movement of the jaw with talking and chewing.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[2]](#Michaudet) Although usually benign, impacted earwax can have significant implications in older adults where it can cause hearing loss resulting in reversible cognitive impairment.​[[3]](#Oron) Impacted earwax does not impair the accuracy of in-ear thermometers.​[[4]](#Twerenbold)

Accumulation of earwax may:​​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[2]](#Michaudet)

- Prevent visualization of the tympanic membrane and of the EAC (required when attempting to diagnose conditions affecting the middle and external ear, respectively)
- Produce hearing loss (patients may be unaware of hearing deficits due to slow onset)
- Produce ear discomfort (e.g., sensation of fullness in the ear, pruritis), ear pain, vertigo, tinnitus or chronic cough
- Contribute to infection of the external auditory canal by impairing the natural cleansing mechanism of the ear
- Produce vestibular (balance) issues (e.g., dizziness)

Factors that disrupt the normal migration of earwax to the outer EAC increase the risk of impaction (see [Table 1](#n01043)). Excessive or impacted earwax is common, occurring in approximately 1 in 20 adults, 1 in 10 children, and more than one-third of older adults and those with developmental/intellectual disabilities.​[[5]](#surveySays)​[[6]](#Willems)

**Table 1:** Factors Leading to Earwax Impaction

| Overproduction Idiopathic excessive cerumen production Obstruction Bony growths in the canal (osteophyte or osteoma) Use of hearing aids, in-ear speakers and ear plug–type hearing protectors​ [8] History of previous impaction Numerous ear canal hairs Use of cotton-tipped applicators or other foreign objects in the ear Inadequate epithelial migration Advanced age: ceruminous glands atrophy, creating drier cerumen that is more difficult to expel from the ear Individuals with developmental or intellectual disabilities​ [6] Nutrition by tube feeding (e.g., in cases of severe traumatic brain injury)​ [9] Cerumen phenotype (wet or dry) |

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms
- Allow visualization of tympanic membrane and EAC
- Prevent infection
- Prevent recurrence

### Patient Assessment

[Figure 1](#psc1021n00007) illustrates the assessment pathway for a patient with suspected earwax impaction. Ideally, earwax impaction is diagnosed by direct visualization with an otoscope to rule out foreign bodies as the cause of obstruction.​[[10]](#Geyton)

Question the patient regarding the common symptoms of earwax impaction (sensation of fullness in the ear, hearing loss, discomfort) and modifiable risk factors for impaction. Patients may describe a history of attempts to remove wax with cotton-tipped swabs or other foreign objects, which may have pushed the wax further into the ear and exacerbated symptoms. If there is discharge from the ear (e.g., pus or blood), coexisting otitis externa or injury of the EAC may be present (see Otitis Externa).

In some cases, irrigation of the EAC is not recommended and patients should be referred for mechanical disimpaction. Referral for assessment and further treatment should occur if:​[[1]](#Schwartz)

- The patient cannot communicate their symptoms (e.g., young children, older adults with dementia or nonverbal patients)
- The ear canal has been injured
- There is a suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation
- There is a history of recent ear surgery
- The patient has tympanostomy tubes
- The patient has chronic otitis media
- There is drainage (e.g., pus, blood) from the ear, hearing loss, tinnitus or dizziness
- The patient has congenital and/or anatomical abnormalities

Assess whether the patient wears a hearing aid, since use of these devices may be associated with increased cerumen production and a higher rate of impaction than in the general population.​[[1]](#Schwartz) Hearing aids can disturb the self-cleaning process and allow earwax to accumulate. Impacted earwax can change hearing aid performance and cause the hearing aid to fit poorly or not seal properly.

If self-care is deemed to be appropriate, patient factors that may modify the choice of therapy include:​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[2]](#Michaudet)

- Increased bleeding risk, e.g., antithrombotic therapy, hepatic impairment or coagulopathy
- Immunocompromised, diabetes mellitus, or dermatological conditions such as eczema or seborrheic dermatitis (higher risk of otitis externa)
- Prior radiation therapy to the head and neck (modifies characteristics of cerumen, making it more difficult to remove)
- Ear canal stenosis or narrowing or the presence of exostoses or osteomas (increases difficulty of irrigation)

### Prevention

The ear is usually self-cleaning; impacted earwax should not be treated in patients who are asymptomatic or whose EAC can be adequately visualized.​[[1]](#Schwartz) However, patients with excessive cerumen or other risk factors (see [Table 1](#n01043)) may be counselled on the potential benefits of preventative measures.​[[1]](#Schwartz) The external opening can be cleaned using a washcloth over the index finger. Attempts to remove earwax with cotton-tipped applicators, objects marketed for earwax removal, hair pins, matches, fingernails and other objects can cause injury and should be discouraged. Although empiric data are lacking, consensus opinion from clinicians is that these actions may push wax farther into the canal, causing or worsening impaction.​[[1]](#Schwartz)

Preventative measures to avoid cerumen impaction include instillation of prophylactic drops, irrigation of the EAC, regular cleaning of hearing aids and routine cleaning of the EAC by a trained clinician.​[[1]](#Schwartz) Topical earwax softening agents (including isopropyl alcohol or hydrogen peroxide drops or irrigation) or emollients are potential options for secondary prevention of earwax impaction, but standard protocols for using these products are lacking.​[[1]](#Schwartz)

Self-irrigation with bulb syringes is an effective preventative measure to reduce symptoms and the need for health-care provider intervention for earwax occlusion.​[[11]](#Coppin2008)​[[12]](#Coppin2011) Patients should be trained to perform self-irrigation safely, although standard protocols and frequencies are lacking. See Impacted Earwax—What You Need to Know for steps outlining proper irrigation technique.

Olive oil drops or sprays,​[[13]](#Rogers) ear candling, or self-probing with foreign objects should not be used for the prevention of earwax impaction as they are ineffective and carry a risk for adverse outcomes.​[[1]](#Schwartz)

### Treatment

Treatment of earwax impaction can be achieved with cerumenolytic agents, irrigation and/or manual removal with appropriate instruments. The choice of which method is used depends on patient presentation and preference, the urgency of earwax removal, and the training and skill of the clinician. This chapter focuses on cerumenolytics and self-irrigation (i.e., irrigation by the patient or caregiver).

Since the ear is generally self-cleaning, products or techniques to aid in earwax removal should be used only when required (e.g., when there is a need to visualize the tympanic membrane) or for symptomatic relief. Discourage use by the patient to simply “keep the ears clean.”

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Mechanical methods of wax removal involve either dry or wet techniques, which can be used alone or in combination with cerumenolytics leading up to or on the day of the procedure. Dry methods involve a trained health-care professional removing earwax under direct visualization using an ear curette, probe, hook, forceps or suction. These manual removal methods are preferred for patients with a non-intact tympanic membrane, abnormal EAC anatomy, a history of ear surgery or conditions that increase the risk of infection.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[2]](#Michaudet) Although these mechanical techniques can abrade the ear canal,​[[1]](#Schwartz) tolerability is similar or better than aural irrigation, and most patients report immediate improvements in symptoms.​[[14]](#Sarode) These procedures are sometimes noisy and can cause discomfort for the patient, so their utility may be limited by tolerability and the patient’s ability to remain still during the procedure.​[[14]](#Sarode)

Wet methods involve using body-temperature water to irrigate the ear canal to dislodge and remove earwax, a procedure sometimes called “ear syringing.”​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax) Although no studies exist that compare irrigation with no treatment, aural irrigation can be an effective technique for removing earwax with success rates ranging from 68% to 92%.​[[1]](#Schwartz) Self-irrigation with bulb syringes can reduce the demand for ear irrigation by health-care providers and has been shown to be safe,​[[12]](#Coppin2011)​[[16]](#psc1021n01035) although irrigation by a clinician may be more effective.​[[17]](#Clegg) Suggest assistance from a caregiver, as it may be difficult to perform the procedure on oneself.  Impacted Earwax—What You Need to Know for steps outlining proper irrigation technique.

Irrigation is contraindicated if the tympanic membrane is not intact, infection is present or patent tympanostomy tubes are present. Irrigation is not recommended if there is a history of ear surgery, the patient is uncooperative, irrigation presents a risk of infection or the affected ear is the patient’s only hearing ear.​​[[1]](#Schwartz)​ See [Patient Assessment](#psc1021n00004) for further details.

Complications of irrigation include pain or discomfort, acute otitis externa, injury to the EAC, bleeding, perforation of the tympanic membrane, vertigo, and temporary or (rare) permanent hearing loss.​​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[18]](#psc1021n1005)​ It is estimated that major complications requiring referral to a specialist occur in approximately 1 in 1000 ears.​​[[1]](#Schwartz)

Ear candling is a procedure purported to remove earwax by creating a vacuum or negative pressure within the ear canal. Studies have disproven these claims and have shown it may cause serious injury,​[[19]](#psc1021n1015) including burns, occlusion of the EAC from candle wax, temporary loss of hearing, tympanic membrane perforation and fire.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[20]](#Hornibrook) Health Canada has received several reports of ear injury from ear candling.​​[[21]](#psc1021n1016) The sale of ear candles in Canada is illegal and their use is contraindicated in all patients.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

A number of agents are purported to enhance removal of wax from the ear (see [Table 2](#d2e500)). These products are instilled for the required amount of time, after which the wax is allowed to be expelled naturally or the ear is irrigated to remove the softened wax. Cerumenolytics should not be used if the tympanic membrane is not intact, if tympanostomy tubes are present or in patients with an active otitis externa infection.​[[1]](#Schwartz)

There is no high-quality evidence making head-to-head comparisons of individual agents or groups of agents (e.g., oil-based vs. non-oil based treatments), and existing comparisons have failed to show superiority of one agent over another or over water or saline controls.​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax) However, in comparison to no treatment, active treatment with cerumenolytics in advance of irrigation is more effective for earwax removal, with longer duration treatments having higher rates of success.​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax)​[[17]](#Clegg)​[[22]](#Loveman) All topical preparations should be close to body temperature when used to avoid caloric effects, which can result in nystagmus and vertigo.​[[1]](#Schwartz)

Water-based cerumenolytics and carbamide peroxide expand and loosen or fragment wax plugs, while oil-based products simply soften cerumen and lubricate the EAC and wax plug.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[23]](#Fullington) In vitro data suggest oil-based products (e.g., olive oil, almond oil, arachis oil**(**peanut oil**)**, mineral oil, and urea/​hydrogen peroxide**5% in glycerol**) are not effective in disintegrating cerumen.​​[[24]](#SaxbyCWilliamsRHickeyS.FindingTheMo-707CC9EB)

No earwax-softening agent has been demonstrated to be superior to others. Sodium bicarbonate and paradichlorobenzene were found by one systematic review to be superior to normal saline for wax clearance after irrigation,​[[25]](#Sridharan) but a 2018 Cochrane review found **water** or saline to be as effective as sodium bicarbonate,​​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax), docusate sodium,​​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax)​[[26]](#psc1021n1012)​ or carbamide peroxide​​[[27]](#psc1021n1013)​[[28]](#psc1021n1010) in facilitating earwax removal with or without irrigation.​​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax)​[[18]](#psc1021n1005) A single instillation of any of these agents into the ear canal for 15 minutes followed by irrigation is as effective as using oil in the canal for 3 nights followed by irrigation.​​[[18]](#psc1021n1005)​[[28]](#psc1021n1010)​[[29]](#psc1021n1014)​ **Urea/hydrogen peroxide/glycerol** resulted in an increased proportion of patients with wax clearance without irrigation compared to normal saline.​[[25]](#Sridharan) Instillation of oil is commonly recommended by health-care providers; however, use of a non–oil-based earwax-softening agent followed by irrigation is often more convenient for the patient and may offer more immediate relief of symptoms.

Commercially prepared otic products are available in a dropper bottle. If household products such as water or olive oil are chosen, the patient should purchase a dropper and instill the substance in a manner similar to other ear drops. Home remedies such as dilutions of hydrogen peroxide or solutions of sodium bicarbonate or saline should be freshly prepared and used immediately (see [Table 2](#d2e500)).

No major adverse effects have been demonstrated with cerumenolytic agents. The minor adverse effects of cerumenolytic agents include discomfort, skin irritation, and transient hearing loss and dizziness; these adverse effects are mild and occur infrequently.​[[1]](#Schwartz)​[[15]](#Cochrane_EarDropsforWax)

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products For Minor Ailments*—Otic Products.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Relief of symptoms (ear fullness, hearing loss, ear discomfort) should occur as soon as the wax is expelled. Initially, hearing loss or fullness may be exacerbated due to swelling of the wax within the canal if it is not immediately removed. If irritation of the canal occurs, use of the product should be discontinued. This is generally sufficient; however, if the irritation is severe or otitis externa develops, appropriate treatment may be required.

The health-care provider should follow-up with the patient after the third or fourth day of treatment to determine whether symptom relief has occurred. Use of oil-based products without irrigation may result in more gradual symptom resolution (5–7 days); follow-up after 5–7 days. If relief does not occur, further assessment and treatment may be required.
