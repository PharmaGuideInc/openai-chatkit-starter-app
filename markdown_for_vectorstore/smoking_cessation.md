### Introduction

Tobacco use kills approximately 45 000 Canadians annually, primarily from cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory diseases such as COPD.​[[1]](#DobrescuABhandariASutherlandGEtAl.T-BA74A950) The toxicity of cigarette smoke is due to the inhalation of about 7000 chemicals including 70 carcinogens.​[[2]](#c0042n00025) Cigarettes are highly addictive because of the rapid delivery of nicotine to the mesolimbic reward pathways, combined with activity in the motivational and learning circuitry of the brain.​[[3]](#c0042n00183) The short half-life of nicotine (60–90 min) forces repeated administration to maintain nicotine levels.​[[4]](#c0042n00026) Other psychoactive compounds in smoke include MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors.​[[5]](#c0042n00027) The polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are inducers of CYP1A1, 1A2 and 2E1 enzymes that have clinical implications when people who smoke quit.​[[6]](#c0042n00028)

### Goals of Therapy

- The ultimate goal is to help people who smoke achieve complete and sustained remission from tobacco use disorder​[[7]](#c0042n00031)
- An intermediate goal is to help people who smoke reduce their tobacco use. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been shown to be effective in reducing cigarette use by a minimum of 50%​[[8]](#Lindson-HawleyNHartmann-BoyceJFansh-A47CAAC4)
- To help people who smoke understand that:

  - smoking cessation is a process, not a singular event; helping people who smoke stay engaged in the process of behaviour change is a major objective of therapy
  - the best odds of quitting are achieved when behavioural and pharmacologic interventions are used to complement each other
  - reduction in smoking by 50% in those unable or unwilling to quit is controversial because there is no long-term health benefit;​[[9]](#c0042n00032) however, reduction is associated with subsequent successful quitting​[[10]](#c0042n00091)

### Investigations

- [Figure 1](#c0042n00006) provides a general assessment questionnaire.
- Measures of physical dependence include the [Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence](https://cde.drugabuse.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/FagerstromTest_2014Mar24.pdf).​[[11]](#c0042n00092) A shorter version is the [Heaviness of Smoking Index](https://moqc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ASCO_Heaviness-of-Smoking-Index.pdf), which assesses the level of tobacco dependence based on questions such as: “How early in the day do you smoke your first cigarette?” and “How many cigarettes do you smoke per day?”​[[12]](#c0042n00093) The earlier a person smokes the first cigarette of the day and the more cigarettes smoked per day, the higher the level of dependence.
- Motivation can be assessed along a continuum by asking the following 2 questions:

  - “Given everything going on in your life right now, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do right now, how important is it for you to quit smoking altogether?”
  - “Given everything going on in your life right now, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most confident you have felt about anything, how confident do you feel you will be able to quit smoking altogether?”

To provide optimal support for smoking cessation, health-care professionals need proper training.​[[13]](#c0042n00184)​[[14]](#c0042n00185) The “5 A’s Approach” is a universally adopted tool clinicians may utilize as part of a smoking cessation program.​[[15]](#SiuALU.S.PreventiveServicesTaskForc-9D9EF2A7)​[[16]](#ClinicalPracticeGuidelineTreatingTo-9D9EF462) The 5 A’s consist of the following steps:

- *Ask* about tobacco use.
- *Advise* your patient to quit.
- *Assess* readiness to quit. Employ motivational interviewing and reflective listening if patient is not ready.
- *Assist* in smoking cessation via behavioural plan and/or pharmacotherapy.
- *Arrange* follow-up. See [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0042n00014) for frequency of contact.

Clinicians can be trained in this approach via several programs including TEACH.​[[17]](#c0042n00241) Health practitioners providing services related to tobacco prevention and cessation may also obtain credentials as a Certified Tobacco Educator (CTE) from the [Canadian Network for Respiratory Care](http://cnrchome.net/). The [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) provides an algorithm](https://www.nicotinedependenceclinic.com/en/teach/Documents/Pharmacotherapy Algorithm JAN2018 updated.pdf) to assist health-care providers in tailoring smoking cessation for primary care settings.​[[18]](#c0042n00242)

The 3 A’s model is an additional strategy used by clinicians to support smoking cessation. The 3 A’s model represents a condensed version of the 5 A’s Approach and involves the following steps:

- *Ask* about tobacco use.
- *Advise* your patient to quit.
- *Act* by developing a smoking cessation plan that includes follow-up visits.​[[19]](#PipeA.EtAl.2014.OttawaModelForSmoki-BBDC04CC)

### Therapeutic Choices

This chapter focuses on people who smoke who want to quit in the next 30 days. [Figure 2](#c0042n00090) provides an algorithm for smoking cessation strategies based on readiness to quit and level of tobacco use dependence.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Tobacco use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition for which multiple courses of therapy might be required. Current interventions including behavioural therapy for 8–24 weeks have shown to be effective at follow-up 6 months post-treatment. Only a small number of patients achieve long-term remission of >1 year following a single course of therapy. Long-term clinical trials are needed to establish the effects of prolonged pharmacotherapy in preventing relapse.​[[7]](#c0042n00031) Though widely promoted, there is no clear evidence for the long-term efficacy of hypnosis,​[[20]](#BarnesJDongCYMcRobbieHEtAl.Hypnothe-A47D46B3) acupuncture,​[[21]](#WhiteARRampesHLiuJPEtAl.Acupuncture-A47DAB69) acupressure​[[21]](#WhiteARRampesHLiuJPEtAl.Acupuncture-A47DAB69) or laser therapy.​[[21]](#WhiteARRampesHLiuJPEtAl.Acupuncture-A47DAB69)

The 5 evidence-based steps required to successfully quit are:​[[7]](#c0042n00031)

- Setting a target quit date
- Getting professional help
- Enlisting social support
- Using medication to quit smoking
- Using problem-solving methods of counselling to quit and remain smoke free

A meta-analysis found that abrupt stopping on the quit day and gradual reduction to stop are associated with comparable quit rates.​[[22]](#c0042n00186) However, in a subsequent randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial in which participants received pre-cessation NRT for 2 weeks, abstinence was more likely to occur through abrupt smoking cessation.​[[23]](#Lindson-HawleyNBantingMWestREtAl.Gr-A47E4EB6) Patients can be given an option as to how they wish to quit. Gradual smoking reduction interventions include reducing smoking by a predetermined percentage from baseline, increasing the interval between cigarettes, and increasing the time from waking to the first cigarette of the day. All gradual reduction methods should culminate in a quit day.

There is a dose-response relationship between counselling and quit success.​[[7]](#c0042n00031) Estimated abstinence rates increase from 13.4% with minimal counselling contact time (<3 minutes) to an average of 22% with contact time >10 minutes. Optimal total contact time is 91–300 minutes, yielding abstinence rates of approximately 28%.​[[7]](#c0042n00031) People who smoke who are attempting to quit should be counselled at least once prior to their quit date, the week following their quit date and weekly thereafter as necessary to optimize therapy and to identify and manage early relapse.​[[7]](#c0042n00031) Formats that have been shown to be effective include face-to-face (individual or group) counselling as well as contact by telephone, mobile text messages and internet sites.​[[24]](#c0042n00187)​[[25]](#c0042n00188)​[[26]](#c0042n00230)​[[27]](#c0042n00229)​[[28]](#MussenerUBendtsenMKarlssonNEtAl.Eff-A47EDD9B) Examples include [www.smokershelpline.ca](http://www.smokershelpline.ca), [www.stopsmokingcentre.net](http://www.stopsmokingcentre.net) and [www.pregnets.org](http://www.pregnets.org/) for pregnant people who smoke.

Increasing the amount of counselling sessions for people who smoke receiving pharmacotherapy is likely to increase the efficacy of pharmacotherapy by about 10–25%, with at least 4 sessions in person or by telephone showing added benefit.​[[29]](#c0042n00206) A combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support (brief advice or counselling) is better than brief advice, usual care or less intensive counselling.​[[30]](#c0042n00207)

### Pharmacologic Choices

The addition of pharmacotherapy increases the odds of quitting (see [Table 1](#c0042n00123)) and should be offered to all patients who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day and who wish to quit. Further research is necessary to determine if NRT would be beneficial for individuals who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day. Exceptions are those with a known contraindication to drug therapy or populations less likely to benefit from pharmacotherapy such as adolescents in whom pharmacotherapy has not been shown to provide additional benefit over behavioural approaches.​[[7]](#c0042n00031)​[[34]](#c0042n00189)​[[35]](#c0042n00190) Pharmacotherapy can be divided into first- and second-line options.​[[7]](#c0042n00031)

There is insufficient high-quality evidence (e.g., randomized, controlled head-to-head comparisons between first-line medications) to recommend one first-line medication over another in a stepped-care pathway. Nevertheless, likely due to safety concerns, Health Canada modified the product monograph for both bupropion and varenicline to advise prescribers to consider the use of NRT prior to prescribing either,​[[36]](#c0042n00191) though it does not consider bupropion or varenicline as second-line medications. Recently, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) released evidence-based clinical practice guidelines promoting the use of varenicline as a first-choice smoking cessation medication in place of nicotine **replacement therapy (NRT)** and bupropion.​[[37]](#LeoneF.T.ZhangY.Evers-CaseyS.EvinsA-9DA04423) Furthermore, according to ATS guidelines, practitioners should begin prescribing varenicline immediately to patients who are uninterested, unwilling or not ready to set a quit date to achieve smoking cessation in order to avoid any delays in treatment.​[[37]](#LeoneF.T.ZhangY.Evers-CaseyS.EvinsA-9DA04423)

Given the long safety record and widespread availability of nicotine replacement therapy, it is the first-line therapy for most patients. NRT increases the rate of smoking cessation by 50–70%.​[[38]](#c0042n00192) Combining the nicotine patch with as-needed gum, inhaler, lozenges or mouthspray can be more effective than the individual products, possibly because it provides a steady baseline level of nicotine with “boluses” for flexibility and treatment of cravings.​[[38]](#c0042n00192)​[[31]](#c0042n00193) Higher doses of NRT patches are also effective in heavily dependent people who smoke (see [Table 2](#c0042n00023)). Nicotine nasal spray and sublingual tablets are not available in Canada.

The standard duration of NRT use ranges between 8 and 12 weeks. For many people who smoke, this standard duration of NRT is insufficient in facilitating abstinence from tobacco use. Extending the use of NRT products to 24 weeks can significantly and safely improve cessation rates;​[[39]](#SchnollRAGoelzPMVeluz-WilkinsAEtAl.-A480007D) however, extending the use of NRT beyond 24 weeks presents no additional benefit.​[[39]](#SchnollRAGoelzPMVeluz-WilkinsAEtAl.-A480007D) While NRT products are considered relatively safe, concerns regarding their use during extreme exercise is warranted. Long and/or intensive periods of exercise have been shown to increase nicotine absorption into the bloodstream through transdermal patches, thereby placing the individual at risk for nicotine toxicity.​[[40]](#LenzTLGillespieN.TransdermalPatchDr-C3E385C5) Ideally, patches should be applied after exercise and limited to the upper body to reduce the risk of excess absorption during exercise.

Bupropion and varenicline are available only by prescription.

Varenicline is an alpha4beta2-nicotinic receptor partial agonist with quit rates higher than bupropion and single forms of NRT.​[[31]](#c0042n00193)​[[33]](#CahillKLindson-HawleyNThomasKHEtAl.-BA75641C)​[[41]](#c0042n00196)​[[42]](#c0042n00099)​[[43]](#c0042n00100)​[[44]](#c0042n00101)​[[47]](#AnthenelliRM.BenowitzNL.WestR.EtAl.-A4DAAEAF)​[[48]](#NidesMGloverEDReusVIEtAl..Varenicli-BBDFD111) Due to reports of neuropsychiatric side effects, the varenicline product monograph includes a boxed warning advocating caution and close monitoring in all patients for the development of changes in mood or thoughts of harm to self or others. For patients with a history of past or current psychiatric illness, varenicline should be used with caution, and diligent monitoring by a health-care professional is recommended to monitor for new or worsening symptoms; however, subsequently published studies suggest no association between varenicline and neuropsychiatric adverse events.​[[41]](#c0042n00196)​[[45]](#c0042n00233)​[[46]](#KotzDViechtbauerWSimpsonCEtAl.Cardi-A4DABFDC)​[[47]](#AnthenelliRM.BenowitzNL.WestR.EtAl.-A4DAAEAF) Additional studies suggest that varenicline is safe and effective for smoking cessation in patients with stable schizophrenia.​[[33]](#CahillKLindson-HawleyNThomasKHEtAl.-BA75641C)​[[49]](#c0042n00198)​[[50]](#c0042n00227)​[[51]](#KishiTIwataN.VareniclineForSmokingC-A4E29AC9)​[[52]](#TideyJWMillerME.SmokingCessationAnd-A4DB8C7B) Moreover, 40 weeks of maintenance therapy with varenicline and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was shown to be safe and effective in prolonging abstinence in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.​[[53]](#c0042n00246)

Concerns regarding potential cardiovascular risks of varenicline prompted Health Canada to review its cardiovascular safety.​[[54]](#c0042n00200)​[[55]](#c0042n00201) However, subsequently published evidence suggests no significant increase in cardiovascular adverse events associated with varenicline use.​[[46]](#KotzDViechtbauerWSimpsonCEtAl.Cardi-A4DABFDC)​[[56]](#c0042n00199)​[[57]](#c0042n00202)​[[58]](#c0042n00203)​[[59]](#c0042n00234) Until further data are available, exercise caution before initiating varenicline in patients with cardiovascular concerns.

Bupropion is an aminoketone that blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. A combination of NRT patch and bupropion may be more effective than bupropion alone.​[[38]](#c0042n00192) However, the addition of bupropion in patients already using NRT did not seem to enhance the effect of NRT.​[[38]](#c0042n00192) Agitation-type reactions have also been reported with antidepressants including bupropion, and monitoring is recommended for mood or behavioural changes or thoughts of harm to self or others in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation.

Second-line pharmacotherapies such as clonidine​[[60]](#c0042n00097)​[[61]](#c0042n00098) and nortriptyline​[[62]](#c0042n00095)​[[63]](#c0042n00096) have evidence of efficacy but are not officially indicated for smoking cessation. Nortriptyline can be used in otherwise healthy individuals with minimal risk of cardiac disease or overdose when first-line therapies are either unaffordable or have not worked. Clonidine may be used in those with coexisting hypertension, where appropriate. However, postural hypotension can be problematic and the drug must be tapered to prevent rebound hypertension.

Cytisine, a natural product derived from the seeds of *Laburnum anagyroides* (also known as Cytisus Laburnum, Golden Rain or Golden Chain acacia), is a partial nicotine agonist that demonstrated efficacy over placebo;​[[33]](#CahillKLindson-HawleyNThomasKHEtAl.-BA75641C)​[[64]](#WestRZatonskiWCedzynskaMEtAl.Placeb-6706CF80) it is available in Canada without a prescription. When combined with brief behavioural support in an open-label non-inferiority study, cytisine was deemed non-inferior to NRT via self-reported continuous abstinence at 1-month follow-up.​[[65]](#WalkerNHoweCGloverMEtAl.CytisineVer-6706D0F7) Cytisine’s limitations include multiple daily doses;​[[33]](#CahillKLindson-HawleyNThomasKHEtAl.-BA75641C) it is initiated at 9 mg per day (divided in 6 doses) then gradually tapered until 1.5 mg is achieved (at days 21–25). A quit attempt should occur on the fifth day after starting the medication (see [Table 2](#c0042n00023) for more information).

Choice of medication should depend on patient preference and absence of contraindications. Initially, monotherapy is preferred. Combination therapy such as the nicotine patch combined with either as-needed nicotine dosage forms (gum, inhaler or lozenge) or bupropion is associated with higher 6-month abstinence rates than monotherapy.​[[7]](#c0042n00031)​[[66]](#c0042n00128) Additional research is necessary to determine if NRT or bupropion would be beneficial for individuals with high levels of nicotine dependence who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day. Cost may be a limiting factor, and combination therapy should be reserved for those in whom monotherapy was unsuccessful or those with severe nicotine addiction. Varenicline in combination with bupropion showed promise in an open-label trial.​[[67]](#c0042n00205) Varenicline, when used in conjunction with NRT, has also been shown to be more advantageous in facilitating smoking cessation and equally as safe compared to using only varenicline.​[[68]](#ChangPHChiangCHEtAl.CombinationTher-C7F7FFCE) [Table 2](#c0042n00023) lists pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

### Special Considerations

### Electronic Delivery Systems

It is important to note that only electronic delivery systems (EDS, electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes) *without* health claims can be legally imported and sold in Canada.​[[69]](#c0042n00216)

Electronic delivery systems are meant to behave like cigarettes. They contain a battery-powered mechanism to heat and vaporize a liquid chemical mixture composed of varying amounts of nicotine, propylene glycol, other chemicals, flavours and/or impurities. The vapour or, more accurately, aerosol produced and the handling of the device may satisfy the sensory and motor aspects of smoking tobacco (e.g., handling of cigarette, inhaling of smoke, keeping hands occupied).

In Canada, the introduction of Bill S-5 changed the way in which EDS are available and regulated.​[[70]](#NorrisSTiedemannM.BillS-5AnActToAme-C7F8A63E) Bill S-5 prohibits the availability and promotion of EDS products to minors as well as specific flavours that may allure minors to use such products, e.g., dessert, cannabis, confectionery, soft drink, energy drink.​[[70]](#NorrisSTiedemannM.BillS-5AnActToAme-C7F8A63E) Bill S-5 also implements more stringent restrictions on EDS advertising, prevent EDS manufacturers from making unsubstantiated claims concerning their products, as well as increasing the severity of penalties for failing to comply with tobacco laws. Furthermore, prior to the sale of any EDS product, manufacturers are required to disclose product information to the Minister of Health.​[[70]](#NorrisSTiedemannM.BillS-5AnActToAme-C7F8A63E)

Health Canada does not recommend using EDS due to lack of safety information regarding exposure to vaporized propylene glycol (among other chemicals used in the products) and their unknown long-term effects.​[[69]](#c0042n00216) Concerns have also been raised regarding the potential toxicity associated with the aerosol of EDS​[[71]](#DinakarCOx2019ConnorGT.TheHealthEff-A4DD93B1)​[[72]](#WalleySCJenssenBPSectionOnTobaccoCo-A4DDB2E9) as well as second-hand aerosol.​[[72]](#WalleySCJenssenBPSectionOnTobaccoCo-A4DDB2E9) Electronic delivery systems are now regulated; some products contain nicotine, while others contain varying levels of other chemicals. Over 400 brands of electronic cigarettes are available but none have an official approval for smoking cessation.​[[73]](#c0042n00217) Despite widespread availability and use, further research is necessary regarding the role of EDS in smoking cessation as opposed to a harm reduction strategy to replace cigarettes in those unwilling or unable to quit using combustible tobacco (i.e., cigarettes). Evidence has suggested that EDS could potentially act as a gateway into the initiation of conventional tobacco products as well as more frequent and heavier use of tobacco products;​[[74]](#LeventhalAMStrongDRKirkpatrickMGEtA-A4DE06A0)​[[75]](#LeventhalAMStoneMDAndrabiNEtAl.Asso-A4DE094B) however, this is unproven. Electronic delivery systems may also create challenges in achieving abstinence, as their use during a quit attempt can lead to a reduction in the use of prescription NRT.​[[76]](#BeardEWestRMichieSBrownJ.Associatio-A4DE69C4) It is also possible, however, that when NRT is ineffective, people add or try EDS. The efficacy of EDS for smoking cessation is of moderate quality.​[[77]](#Hartmann-BoyceJMcRobbieHBullenCEtAl-A4DE861A) Several meta-analyses have been conducted to assess the evidence for EDS in facilitating smoking cessation.​[[77]](#Hartmann-BoyceJMcRobbieHBullenCEtAl-A4DE861A)​[[78]](#KalkhoranSGlantzSA.E-cigarettesAndS-A4DED9A1) In a meta-analysis, nicotine-containing EDS appeared to be superior in achieving abstinence compared to placebo EDS and NRT products.​[[77]](#Hartmann-BoyceJMcRobbieHBullenCEtAl-A4DE861A) Using nicotine-containing EDS rather than placebo EDS or NRT products was associated with an additional 4 out of every 100 individuals achieving smoking cessation.​[[77]](#Hartmann-BoyceJMcRobbieHBullenCEtAl-A4DE861A) Another meta-analysis showed that the use of EDS is associated with reduced odds of achieving cessation from conventional cigarettes by 28% compared with not using EDS.​[[78]](#KalkhoranSGlantzSA.E-cigarettesAndS-A4DED9A1) No causative links can be made. There is worldwide debate concerning EDS, since their potential benefits may or may not outweigh their potential risks.​[[79]](#c0042n00218) In summary, EDS have increased absolute risk for people who do not smoke but have much lower relative risk compared to cigarettes in people who smoke tobacco. Decisions to recommend EDS must balance the risks versus benefits for individual people who smoke in the absence of conclusive evidence. Currently, the use of EDS as an aid in smoking cessation is not recommended.​[[15]](#SiuALU.S.PreventiveServicesTaskForc-9D9EF2A7)

Recently, EDS use has been associated with a clinical syndrome known as e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). As of February 18, 2020, there have been 2,807 cases or deaths linked with EVALI in the United States.​[[80]](#CDC.OutbreakOfLungInjuryAssociatedW-9F24C674) Symptoms of EVALI may include dyspnea, cough, pleuritic pain, fever, malaise, vomiting and nausea.​[[81]](#KalininskiyABachCTNaccaNEGinsbergGM-9F24F481)​[[82]](#ChandHSMuthumalageTMaziakWRahmanI.P-9F24F312) EVALI appears to be related to vitamin E acetate (VEA), which can be found in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing EDS or products.​[[83]](#Blount2019)​[[84]](#BhatTAKalathilSGBognerPNBlountBCGon-9F259716)​[[85]](#Blount2020) In e-liquids, VEA is often added to THC-containing products for the purpose of diluting THC oil while maintaining its coloration.​[[82]](#ChandHSMuthumalageTMaziakWRahmanI.P-9F24F312)​[[86]](#KiernanEClickESMelstromPEvansMELaye-9F261EC4) The risk of EVALI could be increased by several factors associated with EDS practices, including the frequency of use as well as the type and source of cartridges used.​[[81]](#KalininskiyABachCTNaccaNEGinsbergGM-9F24F481) Consequently, individuals should avoid using THC-containing products, particularly those obtained from non-commercial sources.​[[87]](#KrishnasamyVPHallowellBDKoJYBoardAH-9F262080) A diagnostic approach for EVALI may include a physical exam; history of vaping activities; chest imaging; and cardiac, rheumatologic, neoplastic, and infectious testing.​[[81]](#KalininskiyABachCTNaccaNEGinsbergGM-9F24F481)

### Post-Smoking Cessation Weight Gain

From a health perspective, the risks from continuing to smoke outweigh the risks of weight gain.​[[88]](#c0042n00174)​[[89]](#c0042n00221) Address potential weight gain associated with smoking cessation, since quitting smoking with or without pharmacotherapy is associated with changes in body weight.​[[90]](#c0042n00111)​[[91]](#c0042n00112) Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation (NRT, bupropion and varenicline) is associated with less weight gain than quitting using behavioural methods alone.​[[92]](#c0042n00222) Bupropion is associated with the least weight gain due to its anorexiant properties.

While variations in postcessation weight gain are expected, for the average individual, most changes occur in the first 3 months of quitting with a mean increase of 4–5 kg at 12 months.​[[93]](#c0042n00173) It should be noted that 16% of quitters lose weight and only 13% gain more than 10 kg.​[[93]](#c0042n00173) Advise patients to focus on quitting smoking and to manage food cravings by eating low-calorie snacks such as carrots, celery sticks and/or using sugar-free candy and gum. Encourage physical activity as well.

### Drug Interactions with Smoking Cessation

Be aware of the effect of smoking on hepatic metabolism. Induction of CYP1A2 by cigarette smoking can increase clearance and potentially necessitate higher doses of drugs such as caffeine, clozapine, diazepam, estrogens, fluvoxamine, methadone, nifedipine, olanzapine, rasagiline, theophylline, trifluoperazine or warfarin. Conversely, a reduction of the dose may be required if the patient quits smoking. Patients should be made aware of the potentially increased effects (and side effects) of caffeine when they quit smoking.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Smoking and Pregnancy

Smoking before, during and after pregnancy is associated with negative outcomes for both the parent and baby.​[[94]](#c0042n00131)​[[95]](#c0042n00132)​[[96]](#c0042n00133)​[[97]](#c0042n00134)​[[98]](#c0042n00135)​[[99]](#c0042n00136) Nicotine readily crosses the placenta and is concentrated on the fetal side. Moreover, carbon monoxide and other teratogens and carcinogens in cigarette smoke also cross the placenta. Adverse effects such as intrauterine growth retardation, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and potential behavioural and metabolic effects manifesting in childhood make tobacco smoke one of the most damaging teratogens, with permanent and significant morbidity and mortality. Smoking is also associated with a reduction in the amount of breast milk.

Most patients who smoke will attempt to quit when they discover they are pregnant, but the majority will ultimately continue to smoke by the end of pregnancy.​[[100]](#JonesMLewisSParrottSEtAl.Re-startin-A4E05A1B) Factors associated with successful quit attempts include first pregnancy, first trimester, low level of tobacco dependence, sharing a household with people who do not smoke, higher education and not suffering from depression. The restart rate postpartum is about 43% at 6 months, and reflects the chronic relapsing nature of tobacco addiction.​[[100]](#JonesMLewisSParrottSEtAl.Re-startin-A4E05A1B) Interventions that focus on mood, stress and weight management have been successful in preventing smoking relapse following pregnancy.​[[101]](#LevineMDChengYMarcusMDEtAl.Preventi-A4E05C5C)

Pregnancy is seen as a “teachable moment” in terms of smoking cessation. Quitting at anytime during pregnancy is associated with improved birth outcomes. Routine screening for tobacco use is recommended for all pregnant patients, as well as interventions to help pregnant people who smoke quit. There are no known risks to stopping “cold turkey” while pregnant, and quitting should not be delayed until the postpartum period, as the motivation to stop smoking diminishes once the pregnancy is completed. The use of NRT as an adjunct to behavioural support and/or CBT has been shown to be effective in facilitating cessation during pregnancy;​[[102]](#c0042n00209) however, there is reluctance to use pharmacotherapy in pregnancy due to the known and unknown adverse effects of available treatment.​[[15]](#SiuALU.S.PreventiveServicesTaskForc-9D9EF2A7)​[[102]](#c0042n00209) Furthermore, the potential benefits and harms associated with bupropion and varenicline as well as EDS have yet to be determined, and these treatment options should not be recommended during pregnancy.​[[15]](#SiuALU.S.PreventiveServicesTaskForc-9D9EF2A7) The risk/benefit equation for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy during pregnancy depends on whether there is an additional benefit over behavioural measures. With NRT, any additional risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit admission or neonatal death is unlikely,​[[102]](#c0042n00209) especially considering the nicotine will be delivered via less-dangerous routes. Any potential harm from using NRT must be weighed against that caused by continued smoking.

### Management Prior to Conception

Reduction in smoking prevalence in patients of childbearing age can potentially improve maternal and fetal health.​[[103]](#c0042n00137) Whenever feasible, both potential parents should be given assistance to quit smoking, as patients whose partners smoke are less likely to quit.

Sperm cells are rendered abnormal (altered morphology, number and motility) by tobacco smoke.​[[103]](#c0042n00137) DNA-adducts and benzo[a]pyrene (a carcinogen from tobacco smoke) are incorporated into the gamete, with the major contribution from sperm. Therefore, individuals should quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to attempted conception, to allow sufficient time for replacement of the abnormal sperm. Since smoking is a major reversible cause of infertility, all individuals should be given assistance to quit smoking prior to undergoing fertility treatment. Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy can be used during this period without concern for teratogenic effects.

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

Screen all pregnant patients for smoking status and exposure to second-hand smoke at the first appointment and periodically during the pregnancy. All should be advised and assisted to stop smoking completely as soon as possible.​[[104]](#c0042n00138)​[[105]](#c0042n00140) Behavioural treatment, either in person (individual/group), virtually or over the phone, is recommended. The combination of multiple components (e.g., peer support and counselling) may have the best likelihood of success.​[[106]](#c0042n00247) Avoid pharmacotherapy unless the patient is unable to quit using behavioural measures alone. There is a lack of evidence for the efficacy or safety of NRT, bupropion or varenicline in pregnancy.​[[15]](#SiuALU.S.PreventiveServicesTaskForc-9D9EF2A7)​[[102]](#c0042n00209)

It is also possible that patients who find it hard to quit while pregnant might also have other substance use disorders, and be involved in the criminal justice system.​[[107]](#c0042n00211) Mental illnesses such as depression were not associated with failure to stop smoking when pregnant.​[[108]](#c0042n00212)

Given the teratogenic nature of tobacco, the practitioner and the pregnant patient face a dilemma when the patient is unable to quit smoking. When possible, such individuals should be referred to an expert in smoking cessation in pregnancy, and a teratology information centre should be consulted where available. Offer the lowest effective dose of short-acting nicotine **replacement therapy** (gum), to eliminate exposure to smoke and minimize the amount of nicotine exposure to the fetus.​[[109]](#c0042n00144) This may be continued for 8–12 weeks with the goal of maintaining abstinence. There is no agreement on the maximum number of pieces per day. Reserve the transdermal patch for heavily dependent people who smoke and those who do not respond to the gum; recommend removal after 16 hours, e.g., at bedtime, to reduce fetal nicotine exposure.​[[7]](#c0042n00031)​[[110]](#c0042n00150) Bupropion may be used, especially in those patients with an additional diagnosis of depression, as long as there are no contraindications. Use of bupropion during pregnancy has not been associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations.​[[111]](#c0042n00166) Data regarding the safety of varenicline during pregnancy are still very limited.

### Smoking and Breastfeeding

Smoking reduces the production and quality of breast milk.​[[112]](#c0042n00146) However, the amount of nicotine exposure is minimal and overall the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks of continued smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies and bupropion may be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There are no published data on the safety of varenicline or its transmission to breast milk. As such, additional research is necessary before varenicline should be prescribed to lactating patients.​[[113]](#MaritzGS.AreNicotineReplacementTher-9F27C286)

Continued breastfeeding is associated with delayed relapse in patients who have quit smoking.​[[114]](#c0042n00145) If patients smoke and also breastfeed, educate them about the risks to the baby from second- and third-hand smoke; advise them to smoke outdoors and not to smoke just before or during breastfeeding. Changing clothes and hand-washing also reduce the “off-gassing” of toxins after smoking a cigarette.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Encourage people who smoke who have slips while on medication to continue medication for at least 4 weeks and use behavioural interventions to help them to stop smoking.​[[115]](#c0042n00109)
- If people who smoke and use the patch complain of unmanageable cravings and continue to smoke cigarettes, add nicotine gum, lozenge, mouthspray or inhaler as a breakthrough medication.​[[7]](#c0042n00031)
- Although smoking cessation may have a positive effect on mental health after 6 weeks of quitting, in the general population as well as in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders,​[[116]](#c0042n00244) it is important to monitor for low mood and emergence of depression in people who quit smoking, regardless of the method used to quit.​[[117]](#c0042n00110)
- Create a therapeutic relationship in which the patient can report back at the first signs of a relapse to abort it as soon as possible. Scheduling a follow-up visit with the patient shortly after their quit date is recommended to manage withdrawal or to reset the quit date if they did not quit as planned.
- For adolescents, school-based programs that provide complex interventions with elements of CBT matched to stages of change show promise.​[[118]](#c0042n00168)​[[119]](#c0042n00169) Additionally, behavioural counselling interventions may prevent tobacco smoking among school-aged children and adolescents.​[[120]](#c0042n00236)

### Drug Table

**Table 2:** Pharmacologic Agents Used for Smoking Cessation

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions[b] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Alpha2-Adrenergic Receptor Agonists**

| clonidine generics < $25 | 0.1 mg BID PO starting up to 3 days before or on the quit date. Titrate up by 0.1 mg/day PO once weekly as tolerated to a maximum of 0.4 mg/day . Duration of therapy ranges from 3–10 wk | Common: sedation, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth. Less common: anxiety, irritability, memory problems. | Avoid concurrent use with tricyclic antidepressants. Additive effects with other CNS depressants such as ethanol. Additive hypotensive effect when combined with antihypertensive drugs. | Monitor blood pressure and heart rate during treatment initiation. Taper gradually to avoid rebound hypertension when stopping treatment. |

**Drug Class:Antidepressants**

| bupropion Zyban , generics < $25 | 150 mg daily PO × 3 days then 150 mg BID PO × 7–12 wk. Begin 1–2 wk before the selected quit date | Usual: insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, restlessness, difficulty concentrating. Unusual: hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of seizures at higher dosages; agitation-type reactions involving mood/behavioural changes. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Inhibits CYP2D6; may decrease clearance of atomoxetine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, risperidone, sertraline, venlafaxine; may decrease effectiveness of codeine and tamoxifen. Do not use with MAOI s (possible mania, excitation, hyperpyrexia). May be safely combined with NRT (monitor for treatment-emergent hypertension). | Not recommended in patients with conditions predisposing to seizures, history of seizures, current eating disorder or severe hepatic impairment. Least expensive of oral medications officially indicated for smoking cessation. |
| nortriptyline Aventyl $25–50 | 25 mg/day PO titrated to 75– 100 mg/day PO. Quit day is usually set between 1 and 4 wk ; medication is continued for 12 wk | Common: dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, sedation. Less common: confusion, arrhythmias, urinary retention. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Do not use with MAOI s (may cause mania, excitation, hyperpyrexia). Inducers of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampin may decrease effect. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine or paroxetine may increase effect and toxicity. | Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Consider measuring serum levels to reach therapeutic dose (based on efficacy data for depression). |

**Drug Class: Nicotine Receptor Partial Agonists**

| cytisine Cravv $25–50 | Days 1–3: 1 capsule Q2H (up to 6 capsules /day) while gradually reducing cigarette intake Days 4–12: 1 capsule Q2.5H (up to 5 capsules/ day). Target smoking cessation by day 5 Days 13–16: 1 capsule Q3H (up to 4 capsules/ day) Days 17–20: 1 capsule Q5H (up to 3 capsules/ day) Days 21–25: 1–2 capsules/ day | GI upset, nausea, vomiting, sleep disorders, e.g., abnormal dreams. Closely monitor those with a history of psychiatric disorders (theoretical risk). | Due to their shared mechanism of action, cytisine’s drug interactions should theoretically be similar to those of varenicline. |  |
| varenicline Champix , generics $50–75 | 0.5 mg daily PO × 3 days then BID × 4 days then 0.5–1 mg BID PO × 12 wk . Patient should quit smoking 1–2 wk after starting varenicline. If patient is still smoking 4 wk after starting, reassess therapy. Can be continued for an additional 12 wk if patient has benefited. If 1 mg BID not tolerated, can reduce to 0.5 mg BID. No tapering necessary when discontinuing | Nausea (30%) ; may be mitigated by taking on a full stomach, increasing water intake or reducing dose. May cause insomnia; take second daily dose at dinnertime. Neuropsychiatric side effects such as suicidal/homicidal ideation have been reported; monitor closely for changes in mood/behaviour. Close monitoring by health professional for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Combining varenicline with NRT has increased quit rates compared to using only varenicline. | Does not induce cytochrome P450 enzymes; excreted renally unchanged. Efficacy is dose related. Possible desensitization of dopamine receptors attenuates any pleasurable psychoactive effects that are experienced during smoking. With regards to quit rates, taking 0.5 mg BID is nearly equivalent to taking 1 mg BID. |

**Drug Class: Nicotine Replacement, immediate-release**

| nicotine bitartrate dihydrate lozenge Thrive < $25 | Initial strength: 1 mg if <20 cigarettes/day , 2 mg if ≥20 cigarettes/day Dosing frequency: see nicotine polacrilex lozenges; maximum of 15/day for 2 mg strength, 25/day for 1 mg strength | Hiccups, GI disturbances, jaw pain and orodental problems. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Avoid use of acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) while chewing and 15 min before (decreases absorption). | Lozenges should be allowed to slowly dissolve and moved from one side of the mouth to the other periodically. |
| nicotine inhaler Nicorette Inhaler $25–50 | 1 cartridge , as needed, for first 6–12 wk . Encourage patient to use at least 6 cartridges/day for first 3–6 wk Maximum: 12/day Tapering: gradual reduction in use over next 6–12 wk , stopping when reduced to 1–2/day | Mild local irritation (cough, throat irritation, stomatitis, rhinitis) that may decline with continued use; headache, nausea, dyspepsia. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | No known significant drug interactions. | Not a true inhaler—each cartridge lasts for about 20 min of puffing and delivers 4 mg of nicotine, of which approximately 2 mg is absorbed buccally. “Hand-mouth” activity from using the inhaler is preferred by some quitters while others find it to be a trigger. Useful in those with poor oral health or dentures and in those who cannot chew gum. Cold temperatures can decrease the absorption rate. If spending time in cold environments, store inhaler in a warm place such as an inner clothing pocket. Avoid acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) during use and 15 min before use, as this may decrease absorption. |
| nicotine mouthspray Nicorette QuickMist , Nic-Hit Spray $25–50 | Use 1– 2 sprays every 30–60 min Maximum dose: 2 sprays/episode , 4 sprays/h , 64 sprays/day Device must be primed upon first use and if not used for 2 days | Altered sense of taste, headache, hiccups, nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, oral soft tissue pain, stomatitis, salivary hypersecretion, burning lips, dry mouth. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | No known significant drug interactions. | Each spray delivers 1 mg of nicotine. Mouthspray absorbed through buccal mucosa. Avoid acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) during use and 15 min before use, as this may decrease absorption. Peak effect can be reached within 1–15 min of using mouthspray. |
| nicotine polacrilex gum Nicorette Gum , Nic-Hit Gum , Thrive , generics < $25 | Stopping abruptly : 10–12 pieces/day (initial dose of 2 mg for people who smoke less, 4 mg for people who smoke more—consult product insert) Maximum: 20 pieces/day for up to 6 months Stopping gradually in those not ready to quit : use lowest effective dose of gum to relieve acute cravings, to prolong interval between cigarettes. Goal is to reduce smoking by 50% within 4 months and quit within 6 months . Maximum of 20 pieces/day for no more than 12 months Tapering : reduce by 1 piece/day every wk, as withdrawal symptoms allow | Hiccups, GI disturbances, jaw pain and orodental problems. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Avoid use of acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) while chewing and 15 min before (decreases absorption). | Instruct patient to bite down once or twice then park gum between the teeth and gums for about 1 min . Use 4 mg in people who are heavily dependent on nicotine. May be used for temporary abstinence, e.g., to comply with smoking restrictions on airplanes. Avoid acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) during use and 15 min before use, as this may decrease absorption. |
| nicotine polacrilex lozenge Nicorette Lozenge , Nic-Hit Mini-Lozenge $25–50 | Nicotine: use initial strength of 2 mg if first cigarette of the day >30 min after waking, 4 mg if ≤30 min Wk 1–6: 1 lozenge Q1–2H PRN (maximum of 15/day ) Wk 7–9: 1 lozenge Q2–4H PRN Wk 10–12: 1 lozenge Q4–8H PRN Discontinue when dose has been reduced to 1–2 lozenges/day Use beyond 6 months generally not recommended | Hiccups, GI disturbances, jaw pain and orodental problems. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | Avoid use of acidic beverages and foods (coffee, fruit juices, soft drinks, alcohol) while chewing and 15 min before (decreases absorption). | Lozenges should be allowed to slowly dissolve and moved from one side of the mouth to the other periodically. |

**Drug Class: Nicotine Replacement, sustained-release**

| nicotine transdermal patch Habitrol , Nicoderm , generics $50–75 | 21 mg/24 h × 6 wk then 14 mg/24 h × 2 wk then 7 mg/24 h × 2 wk Total daily doses of nicotine may be increased up to 35 mg/day for people previously using 21–40 cigarettes/day , and up to 40 mg/day for people previously using more than 40 cigarettes/day .​ [121] ​ [122] This may be achieved by using additional patches or short-acting nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., gum, inhaler, lozenges, mouthspray). Using more than 1 patch or doses >21 mg/day requires physician supervision. If patient has cardiovascular disease, weighs <45 kg or smokes <½ pack/day , begin with 14 mg/24 h × 6 wk then decrease to 7 mg/24 h × 2 wk | Skin sensitivity and irritation (most common); abnormal dreams; insomnia; nausea, dyspepsia. Closer monitoring by health practitioners for those with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. | No known significant drug interactions. | Start patch on the quit date. Advise not to smoke cigarettes while using the patch, though this is generally safe and does not indicate treatment failure. Educate users on the signs and symptoms of nicotine toxicity. Habitrol: Takes longer to reach peak levels than Nicoderm; should not use while exercising as nicotine toxicity could potentially occur; major supplier of the generic/store brands. Do not cut patch. Nicoderm: More rapid onset and shorter time to peak effects; may be worn while exercising; although not recommended by the manufacturer, can be cut without damaging the delivery device. Patch may be cut. |

[[a]](#fnsrc_drufnad1048786e1537) Cost of 100 pieces of gum or lozenges, 42 cartridges, 150 sprays, 28 patches or 30-day supply of tablets; includes drug cost only.

[[b]](#fnsrc_drufnbd1048786e1540) Cigarette smoking can increase the clearance of many drugs through mechanisms such as induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, 1A2 or 2E1. Patients taking drugs such as caffeine, clozapine, diazepam, estrogens, fluvoxamine, methadone, nifedipine, olanzapine, rasagiline, theophylline, trifluoperazine or warfarin may require dosage reduction when they quit smoking.
