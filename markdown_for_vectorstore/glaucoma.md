### Introduction

Glaucoma is the term used to describe a group of ocular diseases in which optic neuropathy leads to peripheral vision loss. Characteristically, there is thinning of the retinal nerve fibre and macular ganglion cell layer, cupping of the optic disc, and peripheral field vision loss, which precede deterioration of visual acuity. Glaucoma may be classified as *open-angle* or *angle-closure*, referring to whether the anterior chamber angle (the space where the iris meets the cornea) is open or narrowed/closed. The anterior chamber angle provides drainage for aqueous humor; if the drainage is compromised by a narrowed or closed angle, the patient is at risk of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and may develop an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma.

The most common varieties of glaucoma are *chronic*; patients will typically be asymptomatic until they reach the advanced stages of the disease. The presence of symptoms (e.g., eye pain, blurred vision, halos around lights, headache, nausea and vomiting) is mainly associated with *acute* types of glaucoma and warrants urgent referral to an ophthalmologist or emergency room.

Elevated IOP, also known as ocular hypertension, is the most important and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma.​[[1]](#c0018n00007) Other risk factors for glaucoma are likely important in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative condition​[[2]](#c0018n00026) (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013)).

This chapter primarily focuses on the medications that lower IOP; however, laser and surgical procedures to reduce IOP also exist (see [Table 2](#c0018n00176)).

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent, halt or slow progressive visual loss
- Preserve the structure and function of the optic nerve
- Eliminate pain and improve vision in acute forms
- Improve quality of life and functional vision

### Investigations

- Thorough history with special attention to:

  - nature of any ocular disturbances, e.g., loss of peripheral vision, scotoma, halos around lights, decreased visual acuity
  - impaired reading, daily activities, driving or night driving; falling; bumping into objects
  - quality of any pain, e.g., deep orbital, brow or headache
  - associated systemic symptoms, e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
- Careful assessment of risk factors (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013))
- History of medication use that could cause or worsen glaucoma:

  - corticosteroids (common), e.g., inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, systemic, topical
  - drugs with antimuscarinic activity (rare), e.g., antidepressants, antihistamines, antispasmodics, decongestants
  - the anticonvulsant topiramate, which has been associated with acute angle-closure glaucoma​[[12]](#c0018n00145)​[[13]](#Symes2015)
  - the use of oral contraceptives for >3 years, which may be associated with a higher prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma​[[14]](#Wang2016)​[[15]](#Pasquale2011)
- Physical examination:

  - eye examination: positive findings include constricted visual field by confrontation, optic disc cupping and elevated IOP
  - gonioscopy to examine anterior chamber angle

  Note: Screening for elevated IOP alone lacks adequate sensitivity and specificity for the detection of glaucoma. Up to 50% of people with glaucoma have IOP in the normal range (<21 mm Hg).​[[16]](#c0018n00027) Furthermore, about 90% of people with elevated IOP *do not* have glaucoma, although their risk of developing it is increased.​[[17]](#c0018n00028) Systematic screening is thus not recommended but should occur if there is a personal (glaucoma in the contralateral eye) or family history of glaucoma. An ophthalmic examination including IOP should also be considered for patients taking corticosteroids (oral, inhaled, intranasal or topical) on a regular basis who have additional risk factors for the development of glaucoma (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013)).​[[18]](#Kersey2006)
- Comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist
- Laboratory tests:

  - automated perimetry
  - optic disc photography
  - evaluation of central corneal thickness
  - optic disc and retinal imaging​[[19]](#c0018n00201)

**Table 1:** Risk Factors for the Development of Glaucoma

| Type of Glaucoma | Open-Angle Glaucoma | Angle-Closure Glaucoma | Acute | Chronic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquired, Primary | Elevated intraocular pressure Advanced age​ [3] Positive family history Myopia​ [4] Vascular diseases such as migraine,​ [5] hypertension​ [6] or nocturnal hypotension​ [7] Type 2 diabetes mellitus​ [8] | Female gender Advanced age​ [3] Positive personal history (in the contralateral eye) Positive family history Hyperopia | Advanced age​ [3] Positive family history Hyperopia |
| Acquired, Secondary | Blunt or penetrating trauma Previous intraocular surgery Previous intraocular inflammation Corticosteroid use (inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, systemic) Pseudoexfoliation syndrome​ [9] Pigment dispersion syndrome​ [10] | Proliferative diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular angle-closure glaucoma) |  |
| Congenital | Positive family history |  |  |

### Therapeutic Choices

To achieve therapeutic goals (see [Goals of Therapy](#c0018n00011)), the IOP is lowered through the use of medications and laser and/or surgical procedures. This is true even in patients with glaucoma whose pressures are in the normal range.

An algorithm for the management of open-angle glaucoma is presented in [Figure 1](#c0018n00004).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Lifestyle modifications have not been shown to alter the outcome of the disease. Aerobic exercise can lower IOP modestly in some patients with glaucoma.​[[20]](#c0018n00029)
- Laser or surgical procedures are treatment options if drug therapy is unsuccessful or not tolerated by the patient (see [Figure 1](#c0018n00004), [Table 2](#c0018n00176)).

**Table 2:** Laser and Surgical Treatment of Glaucoma

| Procedure | Indication | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Laser trabeculoplasty (argon or selective laser) | Open-angle glaucoma | Laser applications to trabecular meshwork (drainage system). Effect is short term, e.g., 2 y. Most suitable (first line) for patients who are elderly, cannot adhere to medication regimen (due to cost, adverse effects, instillation difficulties or memory impairment),​ [11] or who have primary open-angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or pigment dispersion syndrome. |
| Laser iridotomy | Angle-closure glaucoma | A neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser cuts holes in the iris to permit flow of aqueous humor directly from posterior to anterior chamber; can be done without incising eyeball. Simple office procedure. Effect is long term. |
| Laser ciliary body ablation | Advanced refractory glaucomas | Used where other options are limited. |
| Filtration procedures, e.g., trabeculectomy, nonpenetrating deep sclerotomy, viscocanalostomy | Open-angle glaucoma in cases refractory to medical or laser treatment | A channel is created, allowing aqueous flow from the anterior chamber to a subconjunctival space. Healing and surgical success is improved with topical use of antiproliferative agents such as mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil during or following procedure. |
| Iridectomy | Angle-closure glaucoma | Used in affected eye and prophylactically in other eye. Reserved for rare cases refractory to Nd:YAG laser iridotomy. |
| Drainage tube insertion | Any form of glaucoma where other surgical procedures have not succeeded | Small tube inserted into anterior chamber drains aqueous humor to a plate that is implanted on the sclera, beneath the conjunctiva. |

### Pharmacologic Choices

- Treat any reversible cause of glaucoma (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013)).
- The definitive treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is a laser iridotomy or surgical iridectomy. Aggressive medical treatment is required to ameliorate the damaging effects of extreme IOP elevation until the iridectomy is performed.
- Treat excessive IOP, the only modifiable risk factor in chronic primary open-angle glaucoma. All treatments listed in [Figure 1](#c0018n00004) and [Table 3](#c0018n00023) exert their therapeutic effect by lowering IOP.
- Some patients with risk factors (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013)) in addition to elevated IOP may require treatment even in the absence of glaucomatous optic disc and visual field damage.​[[17]](#c0018n00028)
- Patients with open-angle glaucoma at normal pressures will benefit from further lowering of their IOP.​[[21]](#c0018n00030)
- Target IOPs for a specific patient are set on the basis of:

  - the extent of glaucomatous damage: amount of disc cupping, extent of peripheral vision loss
  - the IOP range believed to have been associated with that damage
  - the burden of therapy to achieve the desired IOP
- Target pressure is adjusted downward if progressive damage to the optic disc or visual field occurs at the target IOP.​[[22]](#c0018n00031)

### Topical Agents to Treat Open-Angle Glaucoma

### Prostaglandin Analogues

Latanoprost, travoprost and latanoprostene bunod are prostaglandin F2-alpha analogues; bimatoprost is a prostamide analogue, structurally similar to prostaglandin F2-alpha. Latanoprost and travoprost lower IOP by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway;​[[23]](#c0018n00037) latanoprostene bunod and bimatoprost act by increasing both uveoscleral and trabecular meshwork outflow.​[[24]](#c0018n00038) The prostaglandin analogues are slightly more efficacious than the topical beta-blockers​[[25]](#Li2016) and are generally first-line therapy. A robust, placebo-controlled study showed that latanoprost can preserve the visual field with a corresponding delay in progression. Treatment differences in favour of latanoprost were evident starting at 12 months.​[[26]](#c0018n00260) Clinical experience with this class has revealed very few systemic adverse effects (headache, flulike symptoms). Ocular adverse effects include darkening of some brown-coloured irides, lengthening of the eyelashes and mild conjunctival hyperemia.​[[27]](#c0018n00039) Any of these agents may be considered first-line therapy because of their effectiveness and excellent safety profiles.

### Beta-Blockers

Topical betaxolol and timolol are effective ocular hypotensive agents that lack significant ocular side effects.​[[25]](#Li2016)​[[28]](#c0018n00032) They decrease IOP by inhibiting the formation of aqueous humor. A systematic review and meta-analysis of topical agents for primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension showed timolol and betaxolol provided visual field protection.​[[29]](#c0018n00259) Beta-blockers are contraindicated when certain pulmonary and cardiac diseases are present (see ). While timolol is a nonselective beta-blocker, betaxolol is relatively specific for beta1-receptor blockade and may be used with caution in selected patients with mild obstructive pulmonary disease.​[[30]](#c0018n00033)

### Alpha2-adrenergic Agonists

Topical epinephrine, the prototype in this class, has not been available in Canada for some time because of unacceptable adverse ocular effects. Apraclonidine was thefirst alpha2-specific agonist introduced, but local allergic reactions limit its use to the management of acute IOP spikes.​[[31]](#c0018n00040) Like apraclonidine, brimonidine suppresses the formation of aqueous humor and may increase uveoscleral outflow. It has a higher specificity for the alpha2-receptor and can be used for a variety of open-angle and angle-closure glaucomas.​[[25]](#Li2016)​[[32]](#c0018n00042) Brimonidine demonstrates some incidence of allergy but is associated with a less severe conjunctival hyperemia.​[[33]](#c0018n00041) A brimonidine 0.15% formulation (preserved with purite rather than benzalkonium chloride) may have a slightly lower rate of ocular allergy than brimonidine 0.2%.

### Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

Like oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, dorzolamide and brinzolamide ophthalmic solutions decrease IOP by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the formation of aqueous humor. Both have limited systemic effects when compared with oral formulations, but they do not lower IOP to the same extent.​[[34]](#c0018n00035) Brinzolamide appears to be as efficacious as dorzolamide and may be more comfortable on instillation.​[[25]](#Li2016)​[[35]](#c0018n00036) These drugs can be considered for adjunctive therapy or for primary treatment in patients with cardiopulmonary contraindications to beta-blockers.

### Cholinergic Agonists

The topical cholinergic agonists (e.g., pilocarpine) directly stimulate muscarinic receptors to contract the ciliary muscle and increase trabecular outflow.​[[36]](#c0018n00043) These drugs are characterized by ocular side effects, including miosis (with reduced night vision), accommodative spasm (including myopia), brow ache and, rarely, in predisposed patients, retinal detachment. Rarely is sufficient drug absorbed systemically to cause abdominal cramping or diarrhea. These drugs are poorly tolerated in children and young adults.

### Fixed-Combination Preparations

Combination products are more convenient and may improve adherence for patients who require more than 1 agent to adequately reduce IOP.​[[37]](#Barnebey2017) These products reduce the cumulative exposure to preservatives and prevent drug washout (from sequential administration of multiple ophthalmic medications).​[[38]](#Nguyen2014) In Canada, there are 6 topical fixed-combination glaucoma therapies available. Brimonidine/​timolol,​[[39]](#c0018n00149) brinzolamide/​timolol,​[[40]](#c0018n00216) dorzolamide/​timolol,​[[41]](#c0018n00148) latanoprost/​timolol,​[[42]](#c0018n00150) travoprost/​timolol​[[43]](#c0018n00196) and brimonidine/​brinzolamide​[[44]](#c0018n00258) are all more effective than the individual agents. All formulations combined with timolol have similar ocular hypotensive effects. Brimonidine/brinzolamide may provide an option for patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension whose comorbidities (e.g., respiratory or cardiac conditions) may restrict treatment with beta-blockers.

### Preservatives

Benzalkonium chloride, the most common preservative in eye drops, works by denaturing proteins and causing lysis of cytoplasmic membranes.​[[45]](#c0018n00205) Unfortunately, as many as 6% of glaucoma patients are allergic to benzalkonium chloride.​[[46]](#c0018n00206) Prolonged exposure to this preservative can result in superficial damage to the ocular surface​[[47]](#c0018n00207) and cause symptoms such as irritation, dryness, itchiness and burning. To increase tolerability of glaucoma drops, alternative preservatives have been developed. Travoprost is available with an ionic buffer preservative (see [Table 3](#c0018n00023)).​[[48]](#c0018n00208) Brimonidine is also available with a non–benzalkonium chloride preservative called purite. Some ophthalmic drops are available in preservative-free, single-dose units.

### Oral Agents to Treat Open-Angle Glaucoma

### Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

Acetazolamide and methazolamide lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor. Their use is normally reserved for emergencies because of significant adverse effects. Approximately 50% of patients are unable to use these agents long term because of GI or CNS difficulties, paresthesias, metabolic acidosis or renal lithiasis.​[[49]](#c0018n00044) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors contain a sulfonamide group in their chemical structure, causing concern of cross-reactivity in patients with an allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics (“sulfa” allergy). However, there is now an understanding that the sulfonamide moiety is not the structural feature associated with the hypersensitivity reactions and significant differences in the chemical structures of nonantibacterial sulfonamides and sulfonamide antibiotics make the likelihood of cross-reactivity extremely low. This is supported by data from clinical trials.​[[50]](#Strom2003)​[[51]](#Wulf2013)​[[52]](#MedLettSulfa2019) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are, therefore, not contraindicated in patients with a sulfa allergy but monitoring is recommended when initiating therapy in patients with an established allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics, particularly in those with serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### Cannabis

The Canadian Ophthalmological Society does not support the use of cannabis (marijuana) for the treatment of glaucoma, due to the short duration of action and undesirable psychotropic and other systemic side effects.​[[53]](#c0018n00220) Further, the regulation of IOP by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) is complex and not fully understood; CBD was shown to elevate IOP and to interfere with the IOP-lowering effects of THC in animal studies.​[[54]](#Miller2018) Other more effective and less harmful treatments exist.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Topical glaucoma medications are highly concentrated to allow adequate intraocular penetration. Systemic absorption through the nasal mucosa can be reduced through digital occlusion of the nasolacrimal drainage system for several minutes following instillation of the drops​[[55]](#c0018n00034) or through eyelid closure for 3–5 minutes.
- Patients should allow 5 minutes between the instillation of different eye drops to avoid a washout of the previously administered medication.
- Patients who use soft contact lenses should wait at least 15 minutes after each dose before reinserting lenses.
- Nonprescription antihistamine products include a caution against use in patients with glaucoma due to potential anticholinergic side effects. Intermittent use of medications with anticholinergic effects will rarely cause a problem in open-angle glaucoma. The caution is included primarily to warn that, in rare instances, drugs with anticholinergic activity can precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in predisposed individuals,​[[56]](#c0018n00045) e.g., elderly females who are significantly hyperopic, have a positive family history, and have not yet had a therapeutic or prophylactic iridectomy (see [Table 1](#c0018n00013)).
