### Pathophysiology

*Candida* organisms are fungi that normally live as commensals in the human oral cavity.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001) It is estimated that 25–75% of healthy, immunocompetent adults carry *Candida* species as part of their normal oral flora.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C) However, when the normal flora is compromised (e.g., by weakened host defence mechanisms), *Candida* overgrowth, direct tissue invasion, and regional or systemic progression may occur, leading to the development of opportunistic disease.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001)​[[3]](#psc1194n1003) Oral candidiasis, also known as oral thrush, oral candidosis, pseudomembranous candidiasis or moniliasis, is a mucocutaneous opportunistic infection caused by *Candida* species.

Oral candidiasis is the most common fungal infection found in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations, with prevalence greatest among infants and the elderly.​[[4]](#psc1194n01037)​[[5]](#psc1194n01038) It is often denoted as a “disease of the diseased,” since it selectively occurs in individuals with weakened host defence mechanisms.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001)​[[6]](#psc1194n1004) Host factors are believed to play a more significant role than the virulence of *Candida* in the pathogenesis of disease​[[1]](#psc1194n1001) (see [Table 1](#psc1194n00002)).

**Table 1:** Risk Factors for Developing Oral Candidiasis

| Disease States Addison disease Anemia (due to iron, folic acid or vitamin B 12 deficiency) Diabetes mellitus HIV infection and AIDS Hypothyroidism Leukemia and head/neck cancer Psoriasis Sjogren syndrome Xerostomia (dry mouth); may be caused by anticholinergic drugs, radiation therapy, dentures or dental appliances | Medications Broad-spectrum antibiotics Cytotoxic chemotherapy Immunosuppressive drugs Inhaled corticosteroids | Other Elderly Infancy and childhood (due to an underdeveloped immune system) Local mucosal trauma Organ and stem cell transplantation Parenteral nutrition Poor dental or denture hygiene (particularly in the elderly) Pregnancy Smoking tobacco Surgery |

C. albicans, reported to account for up to 95% of *Candida* species isolated from the oral cavity, is considered the major cause of oral candidal infections.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001)​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C)​[[3]](#psc1194n1003)​[[7]](#psc1194n1005)​[[8]](#QuindosGGil-AlonsoSMarcos-Arias) Other *Candida* species that cause infection to a lesser extent include C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, C. stellatoidea and C. tropicalis.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001)​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C)​[[9]](#psc1194n1006)​[[10]](#MillsopJWFazelN.OralCandidiasis.Cli-220C8184)

The HIV pandemic contributed greatly to the resurgence of oral candidal infections.​[[9]](#psc1194n1006) However, the establishment of effective antiretroviral therapy has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of oral candidiasis and the number of cases refractory to treatment.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C)​[[11]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDREtAl.Clini-220DB8F0) Oral candidiasis is recognized as an indicator of immune suppression; highest-risk HIV-infected individuals are usually those with a CD4 count <200 cells/mcL.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C) Patients with lower CD4 counts and/or AIDS may experience recurrent infections.

In patients with COVID-19, systemic and oral candidiasis (mostly oral pseudomembranous candidiasis) have been reported.​[[12]](#KatzJ.PrevalenceOfCandidiasisAndOra) Most of the recorded cases were hospitalized, had pre-existing comorbidities and had been treated with antibiotics; a few patients were reported to be previously healthy.​[[13]](#RiadAGomaaEHockovaBEtAl.OralCandidi)

### Goals of Therapy

- Resolve infection or reduce acute candidal overgrowth to a level that can be controlled by the host’s defences and thereby prevent complications (e.g., progression to esophageal candidiasis)​[[14]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed24031-9F56F8A6)
- Prevent recurrences by managing any underlying risk factors (e.g., use of inhaled corticosteroids, poor dental hygiene, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) and instituting antifungal prophylaxis if warranted (e.g., in high-risk patients with HIV/AIDS or advanced cancer)

### Patient Assessment

Candidal infections are often associated with predisposing factors; therefore, a thorough medical/dental history is required to identify and manage any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the infection. In addition, physical examination of the lesions and a description of the signs and symptoms are paramount to an accurate diagnosis and the differentiation between the various clinical presentations (see [Figure 1](#psc1194n00007)). Diagnosis of any form of oral candidiasis is based on clinical recognition of typical lesions. Microbiologic tests (e.g., smears, stains, cultures) can be used when doubts regarding diagnosis exist or resistance to an antifungal agent is suspected. Various test methods for identifying the fungal species are available.​[[15]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed24455-9F56688E) Empiric therapy with an antifungal medication is often reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain.

Candidiasis in the oropharyngeal region may be localized (primary oral candidiasis) or may be a manifestation of generalized candidal infection (secondary oral candidiasis).​[[9]](#psc1194n1006)​[[16]](#psc1194n1012) Primary oral candidiasis may present as several clinical variants, including acute pseudomembranous (thrush), erythematous or hyperplastic candidiasis. Symptoms vary, and clinical presentation may range from no symptoms at all to a burning sensation painful enough to interfere with swallowing and oral food intake, anorexia and weight loss, nutritional deficiency, and decreased quality of life.​[[3]](#psc1194n1003)​[[17]](#psc1194n01039) It is noteworthy that patients may present with more than 1 type of oral candidiasis simultaneously.​[[18]](#psc1194n1007)​[[19]](#psc1194n1009) See [Table 2](#table-11333-62ED45A2) for a description of the different types of candida-associated lesions in the oral cavity.

**Table 2:** Assessment of Candida-Associated Lesions in the Oral Cavity

| Candida-Associated Lesion | Clinical Presentation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush) | Creamy, whitish-yellow elevated plaques (pseudomembranes) on the mucosal lining of the mouth, most frequently on the tongue, soft palate and inner cheek.​ [9] ​ [18] ​ [20] The plaques are easily wiped off with a tongue blade, exposing a raw, erythematous base that is not usually painful.​ [1] | Most commonly diagnosed in the first few weeks of an infant's life, in elderly patients, and in those with underlying malignancies or HIV infection.​ [1] ​ [19] Although typically an acute infection, pseudomembranous candidiasis can persist for up to several months or years, especially in patients receiving inhaled or intraoral topical corticosteroids or in HIV-infected individuals. |
| Erythematous candidiasis (atrophic candidiasis) | Erythematous lesions on the palate and on the tongue, which can cause depapillation and dekeratinization. Lesions vary in size and are accompanied by inflammation of the surrounding tissues.​ [18] Can develop from pseudomembranous candidiasis as plaques are shed, exposing the underlying erythematosus lesions. | Often follows the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or the use of inhaled corticosteroids​ [7] and is the most common variant in HIV infection.​ [9] ​ [18] ​ [19] |
| Hyperplastic candidiasis (candidal leukoplakia) | Chronic, discrete lesions that appear as small, translucent white plaques or larger, opaque lesions on the tongue, palate or inner cheek.​ [1] ​ [9] The white plaques cannot easily be wiped off as in the pseudomembranous variant.​ [3] ​ [9] | Less common; predominantly seen in smokers and males over 30 y of age.​ [9] Considered to be premalignant; therefore, biopsy is recommended.​ [3] ​ [9] |
| Denture stomatitis | Chronic, red, edematous lesions on the denture-bearing mucosa of denture wearers.​ [1] Although usually symptomless, some result in mild soreness, burning or tingling beneath the denture. | Approximately 50% of complete denture wearers experience denture stomatitis.​ [18] |
| Angular cheilitis | Sore, erythematous fissuring at the angles of the mouth due to a mixed bacterial-fungal infection; commonly associated with denture stomatitis.​ [9] ​ [18] ​ [19] | May also be a sign of vitamin B 12 , folic acid or iron deficiency.​ [3] |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Elimination of the underlying factor(s) responsible for the opportunistic infection may be sufficient to allow the microflora to return to normal. However, in the majority of cases, treatment with an antifungal agent is necessary.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001)

### Inhaled Corticosteroids

The development of oral candidiasis is associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Rinsing the mouth and gargling with water after using an ICS or reducing the dose of the ICS when appropriate can also be helpful in preventing recurrent episodes of oral candidiasis. Persons using metered dose inhalers should be advised to use a spacer device to reduce this risk.

### Dentures

To aid in healing and for prevention of denture stomatitis or angular cheilitis associated with wearing dentures, advise patient to:

- Remove dentures overnight
- Wear dentures for no longer than 6 hours during the day to allow the gums to heal and to reduce inflammation
- Clean the dentures daily with a denture cleaner, making sure to remove denture adhesive and debris.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C) Soak dentures for 30 minutes daily in proper disinfecting solution, depending on denture type (e.g., hypochlorite, chlorhexidine gluconate).​[[10]](#MillsopJWFazelN.OralCandidiasis.Cli-220C8184) Store them overnight in water, and consider regular ultrasonic cleaning by a dental practitioner.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C) For more information, see Dental Conditions
- Clean the gums, tongue and affected mucosa with a soft toothbrush
- Review proper fitting of dentures with an oral health practitioner

### Xerostomia (Dry Mouth)

Patients with oral candidiasis due to dry mouth caused by medication may benefit from a medication review and assessment; reducing the dose or stopping the offending agent may be helpful. Keeping the mouth moist by taking frequent sips of water or sucking on ice chips or sugar-free lozenges may also be helpful.​[[10]](#MillsopJWFazelN.OralCandidiasis.Cli-220C8184) For more information, see Dry Mouth.

### Diabetes

If patients with diabetes experience recurrent oral candidiasis, review diabetes control and refer to an appropriate health-care practitioner.

### Smoking Cessation

If patients are active smokers and experience recurrent oral candidiasis, consider offering a smoking cessation consultation. For more information, see Smoking Cessation.

### Infants

If an infant is experiencing thrush, advise parents to keep all toys and feeding bottles/nipples sterilized to prevent autoinfection and recurrence. If the parent is breastfeeding and also experiencing candidal infection of the nipples, refer the patient to an appropriate health-care practitioner for education regarding proper latching and for possible dual pharmacologic treatment of patient and baby. For more information, see Infant Nutrition.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Despite eliminating the underlying factor(s) responsible for the opportunistic infection, in the majority of cases, treatment with an antifungal agent is necessary.​[[1]](#psc1194n1001) Inadequately treated or refractory oral candidiasis can be of particular concern in immunocompromised or myelosuppressed patients, as an initially localized infection may lead to regional (e.g., oropharyngeal to esophageal) or systemic (life-threatening candidemia) spread of the microorganism.​[[21]](#psc1194n1013)

The pharmacologic agents most commonly used for the treatment of oral candidiasis fall into 3 major categories (see [Table 3](#dt1)): polyenes (nystatin), azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole) and echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin).​[[3]](#psc1194n1003)​[[9]](#psc1194n1006)​[[22]](#psc1194n01041) The echinocandins are administered parenterally; therefore, these agents are rarely used for uncomplicated disease.

**Topical nystatin** oral suspension is the most commonly used treatment for mild oral candidiasis,​[[6]](#psc1194n1004)​[[9]](#psc1194n1006) and it is recommended for initial episodes and mild disease.​[[11]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDREtAl.Clini-220DB8F0) Nystatin is well tolerated and does not interact with other medications because it is largely not absorbed from the GI tract when administered orally. Resistance of fungi to polyenes is rare.

Although they are more effective, azoles are recommended as second-line agents due to the emergence of azole-resistant *Candida* strains.​[[9]](#psc1194n1006) C. glabrata and C. krusei are innately less susceptible to azoles; C. albicans and C. glabrata can acquire azole resistance.​[[11]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDREtAl.Clini-220DB8F0) Oral fluconazole is the most commonly recommended azole and is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe disease.​[[11]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDREtAl.Clini-220DB8F0) In cases of recurrent infections (e.g., patients with HIV/AIDS), fluconazole is considered the drug of choice for episodic treatment and chronic suppression of oral candidiasis.​[[9]](#psc1194n1006)​[[11]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDREtAl.Clini-220DB8F0)​[[23]](#psc1194n1010)​[[24]](#psc1194n1020) However, in cases of fluconazole resistance, itraconazole or posaconazole can be equally effective alternatives.​[[9]](#psc1194n1006)​[[25]](#psc1194n1021)​[[26]](#psc1194n1022)​[[27]](#psc1194n1023) Posaconazole may be better tolerated than itraconazole.​[[28]](#PanelOnOpportunisticInfectionsInHIV-22109DA3) Clotrimazole troches (lozenges) are available from compounding pharmacies; they are administered 5 times daily, which is a cause for concern for noncompliance and the resultant lack of efficacy.​[[2]](#TellesDRKarkiNMarshallMW.OralFungal-1EF16C7C)

A network meta-analysis has revealed that fluconazole may be the preferred antifungal agent for prophylaxis of oral candidiasis in cancer patients.​[[29]](#LooYSWongTYVeettilSKEtAl.Antifungal) Clotrimazole is suggested for patients infected with fluconazole-resistant candida.

Miconazole oral formulations (e.g., buccal tablets, mucoadhesive buccal tablets, gel, lacquer, chewing gum), nystatin pastilles and amphotericin B oral suspension may be effective for the treatment of oral candidiasis, but are not available in Canada.​[[8]](#QuindosGGil-AlonsoSMarcos-Arias)

Historically, gentian violet in 1% aqueous or USP (containing 10% alcohol) solution was applied locally for the treatment of oral candidiasis.​[[30]](#psc1194n1014) However, this concentration causes mucosal irritation, ulceration and staining, making it difficult to determine therapeutic progress and decreasing adherence.​[[30]](#psc1194n1014) A recent study demonstrated improved tolerance and sustained efficacy of a less concentrated gentian violet solution (0.00165%; not commercially available).​[[31]](#Mukherjee.PKChenHPattonLLEtAl.Topic-22125B44) However, the safety of gentian violet is of concern, as it has been linked to carcinogenicity in animal studies.​[[30]](#psc1194n1014)​[[32]](#psc1194n01040) Accordingly, Health Canada has issued a recall and safety alert, advising against the use of gentian violet due to an increased risk of cancer upon exposure.​[[33]](#Httpshealthycanadians.gc.carecall-a-62EEE39B)

Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding the efficacy and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis and treatment of oral candidiasis have shown a beneficial effect, further study is required to assess efficacy compared to conventional therapy.​[[34]](#MundulaTRicciFBarbettaBEtAl.EffectO)​[[35]](#HuLZhouMYoungAEtAl.InVivoEffective) Data regarding safety of these agents is insufficient.

The use of plant-derived substances possessing antifungal activity, photodynamic therapy and anti-biofilm treatments that block hyphae formation all require more clinical studies to determine efficacy and safety.​[[36]](#Ramirez-AmadorVPattonLLNaglikJREtAl)

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products of Minor Ailments*—Skin Care Products: Antifungals.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Most patients respond to antifungal therapy rapidly. Improvement in signs and symptoms of mucocutaneous candidiasis occurs within 48–72 hours.​[[28]](#PanelOnOpportunisticInfectionsInHIV-22109DA3)

Since the majority of risk factors for developing a candidal infection are associated with immunocompromised states, it is important to monitor susceptible individuals for signs and symptoms of infection so that early treatment can be instituted and the infection can be resolved before spreading.

Monitor patients taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or taking corticosteroids orally or by inhalation for signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis. If identified in a patient, prompt evaluation by an appropriate health-care practitioner is necessary. Once antifungal treatment is initiated, advise the patient to monitor symptoms on a daily basis during treatment and for up to 2 weeks after clearing of symptoms to ensure the infection has completely resolved.

### Drug Table

**Table 3:** Pharmacologic Therapy for Oral Candidiasis

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antifungals, azoles**

| fluconazole Diflucan , generics Oral Solution: $75–100 Tablets: <$25 | Treatment: 100–200 mg daily PO × 7–14 days Preventive therapy for recurrent infections: 100 mg 3 times weekly PO Preventive therapy in HIV-infected patients: 100 mg daily or 3 times weekly PO | Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. | Inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and therefore decreases metabolism/increases risk of toxicity of several drugs (e.g., atorvastatin, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, simvastatin, sulfonylureas, warfarin). Decreases serum concentration of clopidogrel's active metabolites and may reduce its efficacy. Enhances the QT c -prolonging effect of several agents. | Recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe disease. In HIV/AIDS patients, fluconazole is considered the drug of choice for treatment of oral candidiasis. Preventive therapy only recommended if frequent or severe recurrences. Preventive therapy to be withdrawn in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 count >200 cells/mcL. May be considered if dual therapy is required in breastfeeding patient.​ [37] |
| itraconazole Sporanox Capsules , Odan Itraconazole , other generics Capsules: <$25 Oral Solution: $50–75 | Capsules: 100–200 mg daily PO × 2 wk Solution: 200 mg daily PO × 1–2 wk May treat for up to 4 wk in fluconazole-refractory disease | Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, heart failure, hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, nausea, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, pulmonary edema, rash, urticaria, vomiting. | Potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor and not recommended in combination with several drugs (e.g., alprazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, tamsulosin). Mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. | May be considered for fluconazole-refractory disease. Contraindicated in heart failure due to negative inotropic effect. Solution should be taken on an empty stomach, swished in the oral cavity and swallowed; advise patient not to rinse mouth with water after swallowing. Capsules should be taken immediately after a meal; absorption is variable compared to solution. |
| posaconazole Posanol , generics Tablets and Oral Suspension: ~$700 | Oral suspension: 100 mg BID PO on day 1, then 100 mg once daily × 13 days HIV-infected patients: 400 mg BID PO on day 1, then 400 mg once daily x 14 days Fluconazole-refractory disease: 400 mg BID PO x 3 days, then 400 mg daily PO for up to 4 wk | Diarrhea, headache, nausea. | Strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and not recommended in combination with several drugs (e.g., alprazolam, atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, tamsulosin). Metabolized via UDP glucuronidation and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein; inhibitors/inducers may affect posaconazole plasma concentrations. | May be considered for fluconazole-refractory disease. Oral suspension has been studied in oral candidiasis; use of oral tablets for this condition is unclear. |

**Drug Class: Antifungals, polyenes**

| nystatin generics <$25 | Swish & swallow 400 000– 600 000 units QID PO × 7–14 days Infants: 100 000 units in each side of mouth QID x 7–14 days | Diarrhea, GI irritation, nausea, rash, urticaria, vomiting. | No clinically significant drug interactions, as GI absorption is insignificant. Avoid concomitant topical use of chlorhexidine (e.g., denture wearers), as the antifungal effect of nystatin will be negated.​ [38] | Recommended for initial episodes or mild disease; not as effective as azoles for moderate-severe infections. Retain in the mouth for as long as possible before swallowing; avoid food/drink for 5–10 min after. To decrease the rate or risk of recurrence, treatment to be continued for several days following disappearance of lesions. Nystatin’s relatively short contact time with the oral mucosa, high clearance from the oral cavity and requirement for frequent applications potentially limit its usefulness. May be considered if dual therapy is required in breastfeeding patient.​ [37] |
