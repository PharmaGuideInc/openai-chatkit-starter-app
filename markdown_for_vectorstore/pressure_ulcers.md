### Introduction

Previously known as pressure ulcers, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bedsores, pressure injury is now the preferred term, as it reflects the fact that the injured skin may be intact or open, depending on the stage of the injury (see [Table 1](#StagingOfPressureInjuries-985B7FBE)).​[[1]](#NationalPressureInjuryAdvisoryPanel-7F217B63)

A **pressure injury (PI)** is localized damage to the skin and/or underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure or pressure in combination with shear. The injured area may present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be painful. The tolerance of soft tissue for pressure and shear may be affected by microclimate, nutrition, perfusion and comorbidities.​[[1]](#NationalPressureInjuryAdvisoryPanel-7F217B63) Risk factors for PI include smoking, poor nutrition and reduced mobility, e.g., older patient, spinal cord injury, critical care patient, patient at end of life.

**Medical device–related PIs** are those resulting from the use of devices applied to the patient for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, generally conforming to the pattern and shape of the device.​[[1]](#NationalPressureInjuryAdvisoryPanel-7F217B63)

**Mucosal membrane PIs** are those occurring on a mucous membrane in a location where a medical device was used. Due to the anatomy of the tissue, these injuries cannot be staged.​[[1]](#NationalPressureInjuryAdvisoryPanel-7F217B63)

Prevalence estimates for PIs in Canadian health-care settings range from 15–30%,​[[2]](#WoodburyMGHoughtonPE.PrevalenceOfPr-CE918CA9) the majority of which are designated preventable by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute.​[[3]](#CanadianPatientSafetyInstitute.Neve-CE92098D) The cost of treatment of a PI acquired in hospital was estimated to be $44,000 for a stage 2 injury, increasing to $90,000 for a stage 4 injury in one study reviewing Ontario hospital data from 2002–2006.​[[4]](#ChanBIeraciLMitsakakisNEtAl.NetCost-CE92CAD0)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent pressure injuries
- Treat existing pressure injuries:

  - heal existing injuries, if healable
  - if not healable, prevent further damage to existing pressure injuries
  - manage pain
  - prevent and/or treat infection

### Prevention

### Assessment

Pressure injuries can develop quickly and be a challenge to heal, making determination of the patients who are most vulnerable to them crucial to ensuring cost-effective allocation of resources for prevention. This can be achieved by:

- Informal assessment using clinical judgment (usually by nursing staff) to help identify patients at risk. A systematic review​[[5]](#ColemanSGoreckiCNelsonEAEtAl.Patien-CF8A3DC9) found risk is likely related to a complex interplay of various factors but identified the following important elements:
  - most frequent independent predictors: decreased mobility/activity; impaired skin perfusion; poor skin condition
  - other predictors: increased skin moisture, older age, poor nutrition, decreased general health status, abnormal laboratory values (e.g., low hemoglobin or albumin, aberrant values for white blood cells, urea, electrolytes)
- Completion of a formalized risk assessment scale (in combination with informal assessment using clinical judgment) upon admission to hospital or nursing home, during transitions between units and whenever there are major health changes; however, these scales should not be used to monitor degree of wound healing.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45) Many validated scales are available (e.g., Braden, Norton, Waterlow, Ramstadius); however, there is no evidence to confirm that any scale is more effective for prevention of PI than informal assessment using clinical judgment​[[7]](#MooreZEPattonD.RiskAssessmentToolsF-CF893388)
- Assessment of nutritional status using a validated tool​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pressure Relief

Pressure and shear forces on bony prominences are the main cause of PI: pressure relief is the cornerstone of both prevention and treatment. External pressure is concentrated over bony prominences. If the external pressure applied to tissue is higher than the capillary closing pressure, there is occlusion of the blood vessels, decreased perfusion and tissue necrosis. PIs in subdermal tissues under bony prominences likely occur between 1 hour and 4–6 hours after sustained tissue loading.​[[9]](#c0067n00095) Less pressure is required to create tissue ischemia in patients with impaired circulation secondary to disease process or injury, in patients receiving vasopressors, and in patients with conditions resulting in impaired oxygenation or perfusion.​[[10]](#c0067n00092) Repositioning, support surfaces and consideration for medical devices all play important roles in achieving pressure relief.

### Repositioning

Implement a repositioning schedule to protect intact skin.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45) Avoid placing weight directly on bony prominences.​[[11]](#WHS2023)​[[12]](#c0067n00133) There is a lack of robust evidence regarding optimal position and frequency of repositioning.​[[13]](#GillespieBMChaboyerWPMcInnesEEtAl.R-13AFA35E) Experts recommend encouraging patients with enough mobility to shift position frequently and repositioning patients who cannot do so themselves every 2–4 hours while in bed (taking overall condition, tolerance, level of mobility and support surface into consideration)​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[14]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-0CE766E6)​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB) and every 15 minutes while sitting.​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB) Limiting elevation of the head to 30 degrees or less if medically feasible is also recommended.​[[14]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-0CE766E6)​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB)

### Support Surfaces

Patients at high risk of developing a PI should not remain on a standard mattress;​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[14]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-0CE766E6) however, there is no clear benefit of one specialized support surface over another.​[[16]](#ShiCD-EB3E9FBA)

Commercially available support surfaces are effective for pressure relief​[[11]](#WHS2023)​[[17]](#c0067n00091)​[[18]](#c0067n00096) and may be classed as *reactive* or *active*. A *reactive* support surface is a powered or nonpowered surface that changes load distribution in response to applied loads only. This includes mattresses or mattress overlays that are filled with air, water, gel, fluid, foam, or a combination of these, low air-loss mattresses, and air-fluidized mattresses. An *active* support surface is a powered surface that changes its load distribution with or without applied load. Only alternating-pressure mattresses fall into this category.​[[11]](#WHS2023)​[[19]](#c0067n00094)

### Pressure-Relieving Devices

Use soft pillows or foam wedges between bony prominences such as knees and ankles, and to suspend heels above the mattress while the patient is in bed, independent of the support surface.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)

Medical-grade sheepskin overlays have been shown to decrease the risk of developing a PI. Use of some pressure-relieving overlays on operating tables and in the postoperative period reduces the incidence of PI development postoperatively.​[[16]](#ShiCD-EB3E9FBA) Donut seat cushions are not recommended.​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB)

### Consideration for Medical Devices

Avoid positioning the patient directly onto medical devices such as tubes or drainage systems. Remove devices that are potential sources of pressure as soon as medically feasible. Ensure the removal of slings that are not intended to be left under the patient after transfer. Inspect the skin under the medical devices regularly and keep it clean and dry.​[[12]](#c0067n00133)

### Preventive Skin Care

Keep the skin clean and adequately hydrated. Use nonalkaline soaps and cleansers and ensure prompt clean-up after episodes of incontinence. Protect the skin from moisture damage by using a barrier product.​[[12]](#c0067n00133)

Some studies have assessed the effectiveness of applying topical preparations or dressings directly to the skin in attempt to prevent PI development. Interventions that have been shown to possibly be effective for prevention include silicone dressings applied directly to bony prominences​[[20]](#Beeckman-EB3F3D0F) and the application of fatty acid creams; however, the evidence is limited and further study is needed.​[[21]](#MooreZEWebsterJ.DressingsAndTopical-95628E3F)

### Nutrition

Assess patients who are at risk of developing a PI for malnutrition, and create and implement an individualized nutrition plan to ensure adequate nutrition. If feasible/available, consultation with a dietitian should be considered.​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)

### Treatment

### Assessment

#### Staging

When undertaking treatment of a patient with a PI, use a recognized staging system to describe the extent of tissue loss and maximum depth of tissue damage. Staging is used for initial assessment and to describe the worsening of a wound but not to monitor improvement, as it does not accurately describe the physiological processes occurring in a healing PI. [Table 1](#StagingOfPressureInjuries-985B7FBE) lists the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel’s staging criteria for PIs; these criteria are specific to PIs and do not apply to other skin injuries.

**Table 1:** Staging of Pressure Injuries​[[1]](#NationalPressureInjuryAdvisoryPanel-7F217B63)[[22]](#NationalPressureUlcerAdvisoryPanel.-7EB13B8D)[[23]](#BakerMichelle.DetectingPressureDama-7EB24546)

| Pressure injuries do not necessarily progress in the order presented, nor do they heal by reverse staging. |
| Stage 1 Nonblanchable erythema of intact skin Intact skin with a localized area of nonblanchable erythema. Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature or firmness may precede visual changes. In lighter skin tones, colour changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury. Blanching may not be visible in darkly pigmented skin and its colour may differ from skin in the surrounding area.​ [23] In darkly pigmented skin, look for changes in skin tone, temperature and tissue consistency compared to the adjacent skin. Colour changes may be more easily identified by moistening the skin.​ [22] |  |
| Stage 2 Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture-associated skin damage, including incontinence-associated dermatitis, intertriginous dermatitis, medical adhesive-related skin injury or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions). |  |
| Stage 3 Full thickness skin loss Adipose (fat) is visible in the wound and granulation tissue, and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunnelling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable PI. |  |
| Stage 4 Full thickness skin and tissue loss Exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunnelling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable PI. |  |
| Unstageable Obscured full thickness skin and tissue loss The extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar is removed, a stage 3 or stage 4 PI will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e., dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed. |  |
| Deep Tissue Persistent nonblanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration Intact or nonintact skin with localized area of persistent nonblanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration (visible in lightly pigmented skin but may be very difficult to detect in darkly pigmented skin​ [23] ) or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood-filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin colour changes. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness PI (stage 3 or 4 or unstageable). Do not use deep tissue PI to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic or dermatologic conditions. |  |

#### Healability

After identifying and addressing the cause of the wound and any patient-centred concerns, healability of the wound must be determined.

- **Healable** wounds: no known factors to prevent the wound from healing​[[24]](#SibbaldRGWoundBedP-DCE31F82)
- **Nonhealable** wounds: patient does not have the physical capacity to heal, e.g., peripheral vascular disease (lack of blood flow to the area) that cannot be surgically corrected, wounds due to cancer, patients at end of life​[[24]](#SibbaldRGWoundBedP-DCE31F82)
- **Maintenance** wounds: healable, nonhealing wounds that cannot be healed at the present time due to patient- or system-related concerns that prevent optimal care, e.g., lack of access to pressure-relieving devices​[[24]](#SibbaldRGWoundBedP-DCE31F82)

Treatment plans, including local wound care, differ depending on healability. While the goal with healable wounds is to achieve complete healing of the injury, the goal of therapy with nonhealable and maintenance wounds is to reduce pain and prevent infection.​[[24]](#SibbaldRGWoundBedP-DCE31F82)

#### Other Factors

Other factors will determine the best route of treatment; these are discussed below and include: determining pressure source, nutrition status, smoking status, medications that interfere with wound healing, pain management, psychosocial support and financial considerations.

### Therapeutic Choices

Interprofessional teams are used to deliver PI prevention and treatment programs effectively and efficiently, although formal studies of their impact are lacking.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[25]](#MooreZEWebsterJSamuriwoR.Wound-care-49A21094) In addition to a clinician trained in the prevention and management of chronic wounds, other team members play important roles:

- Front-line staff members, such as nurses and personal support workers, ensure proper day-to-day care of both injuries and intact skin
- Chiropodists, occupational therapists or physiotherapists ensure proper pressure redistribution specific to the area in question
- Registered dietitians ensure optimal nutrition
- Pharmacists review patient medications and assist in smoking cessation education/intervention
- Patient and family members’ engagement ensure adherence to recommended interventions​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB)

A comprehensive approach by the interprofessional team to the treatment of individuals who develop PIs is essential to optimize healing. This includes:

- Determining and addressing the **cause** (see [Determining and Addressing the Cause of the Injury](#DeterminingAndAddressingCause-D9636209)) of the injury (pressure, placement of medical devices)
- Addressing individual **patient-centred concerns** (see [Patient-Centred Concerns](#Patient-centredConcerns-D9636403); nutrition, smoking cessation, medications, pain, psychosocial, financial)

Followed by:

- Determining **healability** of the injury
- Local **wound care** (cleansing, débridement, dressings, infection)

### Determining and Addressing the Cause of the Injury

PIs are caused by pressure and shear forces on bony prominences and/or placement of medical devices. Determination of the source of the pressure and relieving it is essential to allow interventions aimed at healing a PI to be effective. Addressing the cause of a PI is often enough to manage a stage 1 injury and prevent it from progressing to stages 2–4 (see [Table 1](#StagingOfPressureInjuries-985B7FBE)).

### Pressure Relief

The mainstay of treatment of PIs is relief of the pressure and shear forces that led to their development (see Prevention, [Pressure Relief](#Prevention_PressureRelief-A337895B)). Strategies for pressure relief in patients with PIs include:

- **Support surfaces**. Various specialized support surfaces that aim to redistribute/offload pressure from the areas of concern are available. These range from simple foam mattresses to technologically complex air-fluidized mattresses. Further study is needed to determine which support surfaces are most effective at relieving pressure.​[[16]](#ShiCD-EB3E9FBA)
- **Pressure-relieving devices**. Devices such as specialized seat cushions, booties, pillows and wedges are also used to reduce pressure and shear on the injured area.
- **Repositioning**. Although there is no adequate evidence looking at the effect of repositioning on healing of PIs,​[[26]](#MooreZECowmanS.RepositioningForPres-AB6951E3) implementing personalized repositioning schedules is widely recommended (in addition to the use of specialized support surfaces and pressure-relieving devices).​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[14]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-0CE766E6)​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB) Reposition patients in a manner that minimizes friction and shear by using lifting sheets, wedges and pillows. Common recommendations include following a positioning schedule every 2–4 hours while in bed and weight-shifting every 15 minutes while sitting.​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB)
- **Consideration for medical devices**. It is crucial to follow all recommendations to prevent a device-related PI (see [Prevention](#Prevention-A2B65DB7)). If a PI does develop due to placement of a medical device such as nasal oxygen prongs, catheters or other drains, it is reasonable to use tape to secure them in an alternative manner.

### Patient-Centred Concerns

In addition to determining and addressing the cause of the PI, consider the following patient-centred concerns that play a significant role in creating optimal conditions for wound healing.

### Nutrition

Implement an individualized nutrition plan to ensure adequate nutrition. Ascorbic acid, zinc and protein supplementation have been reported to improve wound healing; however, available evidence does not show a clear benefit of any nutritional supplementation for prevention or treatment of PIs.​[[27]](#LangerGFinkA.NutritionalInterventio-139B8830)

### Smoking Cessation

Nicotine, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide are the main toxins in cigarette smoke that are associated with impaired wound healing. While the exact mechanism of delayed healing is not understood, all 3 substances impair tissue oxygenation.​[[28]](#McDanielJCBrowningKK.SmokingChronic-DA5E6A25) Excessive smoking may also contribute to anorexia and ensuing malnutrition. Encourage all patients with PIs to quit smoking and refer them to appropriate smoking cessation programs. See Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation.

### Medications Affecting Wound Healing

Wounds progress through 4 stages of healing (i.e., hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative and maturation/remodeling stages), with overlap between stages. Medications may interfere with these stages and delay or prevent wound healing. Avoidance or dose reduction of medications affecting the relevant phase of wound healing is recommended where possible. See [Table 2](#EffectsOfMedicationOnPhasesOfWoundH-DA71370F).

**Table 2:** Effects of Medication on Phases of Wound Healing​[[29]](#AndersonKHammRL.FactorsThatImpairWo-985D08B0)[[30]](#LevineJM.TheEffectOfOralMedicationO-DA72771B)[[31]](#WoundCareCanada2016.FoundationsOfBe-DA72F730)

| Stage of Wound Healing (Duration) | Description | Examples of Medications Interfering with Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hemostasis (minutes) | Vasoconstriction, creation of platelet plug, coagulation and formation of fibrin mesh to hold clot together | Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, cytotoxic agents (decreased hematopoiesis) |
| Inflammation (4–6 days) | Blood vessels leak plasma and the resulting fluid engorgement facilitates transportation of white blood cells, antibodies, enzymes | NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors), immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |
| Proliferation (4–24 days) | Fibrous tissue formation, collagen deposition, blood vessel formation, re-epithelialization | NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors), systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |
| Remodelling (21 days–2 y) | Reorganization of collagen fibres, wound contraction, increase in flexibility and tensile strength (to a maximum of 80% of preinjury strength) of wound | NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors), systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |

**Abbreviations**

COX–2
:   cyclooxygenase-2

NSAID
:   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug

### Pain Management

Pressure injuries can be extremely painful, and pain management is critical to the success of therapy. Develop a patient-specific pain-management strategy based on a comprehensive pain assessment. Identifying the type of pain and its cause guides clinicians as to which type of intervention to use, while quantification of pain provides direction with regards to aggressiveness of treatment.

Patients with PIs may experience the following, alone or in combination:

- Cyclical acute wound pain: associated with scheduled wound-care activities such as dressing changes
- Noncyclic acute wound pain: associated with intermittent manipulation of the wound, such as débridement
- Chronic wound pain: ongoing pain independent of wound manipulation (e.g., between dressing changes)

All 3 types of pain may be nociceptive (direct reaction to noxious stimuli) and/or neuropathic (nerve-related that may be ongoing or intermittent) in nature. Pharmacological management of pain differs depending on the nature of the pain. See Acute Pain and Neuropathic Pain for information on the pharmacological management of pain.

### Psychosocial Management

Chronic disease, including wounds, may be associated with stress, anxiety and depression. In addition, these conditions may heighten a person’s experience of pain.​[[32]](#WooKYKrasnerDLSibbaldRG.PainInPeopl-DC7A2430) Patients experiencing emotional distress may benefit from interventions such as anxiety-reduction techniques, cognitive behavioural therapy and support groups.

Wounds and wound care may cause a disruption in a person’s everyday activities and decrease their ability to socialize. Minimize impact on quality of life by adjusting wound care schedules to accommodate important patient activities and using dressings that are less cumbersome (e.g., self-adhering) and reduce odour where feasible (e.g., avoid hydrocolloid dressings).

### Financial Considerations

Ascertain if there are any financial barriers to the patient adhering to treatment: consult a social worker where needed to help patients navigate these issues. Examples of expenses that may arise include both direct costs such as medications and dressings that are not covered by insurance and psychotherapy and indirect costs such as transportation to appointments.

### Local Wound Care

Local wound care is required for stage 2–4 injuries (see [Table 1](#StagingOfPressureInjuries-985B7FBE)) and involves the following:

- Wound cleansing
- Wound débridement
- Wound dressing

It is important to monitor the wound by photography or measurements on a regular basis to assess improvement.

### Wound Cleansing

Wound cleansing facilitates healing by using fluids to reduce the bacterial burden and to remove devitalized tissue and metabolic waste. Cleansing is recommended at initial assessment to improve visualization of the injury and prepare the wound bed for treatment, and at every dressing change.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45) Types of cleansing solutions and considerations for their use are presented in [Table 3](#WoundCleansers-DCEB3731).

**Table 3:** Wound Cleansing Solutions​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)[[33]](#InternationalWoundInfectionInstitut-DCF702BE)[[34]](#WoundsCanada.ProductPickerSkinAndWo-DCF755AF)

| Cleansing Solution | Description | Usage Considerations | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tap water | Drinkable (potable) tap water | No evidence that using tap water to cleanse wounds increases or decreases infection or healing.​ [35] ​ [36] In the absence of potable tap water, boiled and cooled water or distilled water can be used.​ [35] | Most wounds. Some sources recommend caution in immunocompromised patients.​ [37] |
| Sterile normal saline | 0.9% sodium chloride in water (multi- or single-use containers) | Open saline should be discarded after 24 hours . | Safe for all types of wounds. |
| Commercial wound cleansers | Iso- or hypertonic solutions that may contain: Surfactants to facilitate autolysis Preservatives to extend shelf life | Cleanse and loosen debris from wound bed. Surfactants reduce surface tension between wound bed and debris, allowing removal with less force. “Spray” or “stream” applicator products allow for control of force used during application. | Wounds with adherent cellular debris. |
| Antimicrobial wound cleansers | Antimicrobial solutions effective against a variety of pathogens, e.g., acetic acid, chlorhexidine, octenidine hydrochloride (OCT), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), povidone-iodine, sodium hypochlorite Strength of the antimicrobial determines efficacy and potential toxicity of the product | Often combined with surfactants in commercial products (e.g., OCT, PHMB). Antimicrobial activity may be dependent on how long the wound bed is exposed to the product. Some products require the wound bed to be rinsed with water or saline after use to remove residue. Cytotoxicity of the solution must be considered: may negatively affect wound healing. | Wounds with high bacterial colonization or suspected or confirmed infection. |

After choosing an appropriate solution with which to cleanse the wound and the surrounding skin, the following procedure is recommended:

1. Warm cleansing solution to room temperature before use to increase patient comfort.
2. Gently irrigate the wound with enough solution to completely cover the surface of the wound (at least 100–150 mL, or more for larger wounds) using pressure sufficient to remove debris without causing trauma to the tissue. Use of a 30–35 mL syringe with a 18- or 19‑gauge angiocath is felt to provide appropriate pressure by some experts.​[[38]](#BritishColumbiaProvincialNursingSki-6683A795)
3. If it is not possible to visualize where the solution is going and/or the solution cannot be retrieved or does not drain out (e.g., extensive tunnelling, fistulas, deep wounds), do not use irrigation methods to cleanse the wound. Instead, gently apply warm, solution-soaked gauze compresses to the injury for 30 seconds and then repeat.
4. Gently pat the wound and surrounding skin dry to facilitate optimal adherence of the dressing.

*Note*: wound-cleansing technique has not been well studied;​[[36]](#MooreZECowmanS.WoundCleansingForPre-DCEC087E) some wound care clinicians recommend using soaked gauze compresses for all wounds.

### Wound Débridement

The goals of wound débridement are:

- To allow granulation tissue formation and subsequent re-epithelialization by removing devitalized tissue and inflammatory agents​[[39]](#c0067n00107)
- To prevent infection by removing dead tissue​[[14]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-0CE766E6)
- To convert the chronic wound to the molecular and cellular environment of an acute, healing wound (in the case of surgical débridement that includes viable tissue)​[[11]](#WHS2023)

Wound débridement may be accomplished in many ways. Select the débridement method most appropriate to the wound bed, patient-centred concerns, healability and clinical setting, keeping the following in mind:

- Health-care professionals must have undergone training specific to the method of débridement being used.​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)
- Prior to any method of débridement on the lower extremities, complete a vascular assessment (palpate pedal pulses, check capillary refill, ankle/brachial index and toe pressure) to rule out vascular compromise in the legs, in which case arterial blood supply may not be sufficient to support healing of the wound after débridement.
- Débridement is not recommended on wounds with dry, hard, stable eschar (scabs) on ischemic limbs or on heels, unless infection is suspected.​[[12]](#c0067n00133)
- More than one débridement method may be appropriate for a given wound, and different methods may be used in combination.

See [Table 4](#DebridementMethods-41E96567) for a description of the methods used for débridement of wounds.

**Table 4:** Débridement Methods​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)

| Method | Description | Clinical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sharp/surgical | Conservative sharp: Removal of nonviable tissue with sharp instruments such as sterile scissors, curette, forceps, scalpel. Viable tissue is not excised. Generally performed at the bedside. | Pain and bleeding not expected, as only nonviable tissue is being manipulated. |
| Surgical/sharp: Removal of nonviable and some viable tissue with sharp instruments. Generally performed at the bedside but removal of large amounts of tissue is recommended to be done in the operating room (OR).​ [12] | Causes pain and bleeding due to excision of viable tissue. Pain management is critical. Topical or local anesthesia may be required for procedures not taking place in the OR. Bleeding can be managed by local pressure applied with gauze or by electrocautery. Alginate dressings can also help stop bleeding (see Wound Dressings ). Recommended when there is urgent need, such as with advancing cellulitis, crepitus, fluctuance and/or sepsis from wound-related infection. Considered in the presence of undermining, tunnelling or extensive necrosis. Not appropriate for nonhealable wounds. |
| Autolytic | Moist wounds naturally produce fluids containing white blood cells and enzymes during the inflammatory phase of healing, which liquefies necrotic tissue. Moisture-retentive dressings (see Wound Dressings ) are used to maintain the moist environment necessary to rehydrate and soften devitalized tissue, allowing it to be broken down naturally. Dry eschar (with the exception of that on heels or ischemic limbs) can be scored with a scalpel to facilitate softening and breakdown. | Painless. Increased exudate may occur: choose a dressing that can accommodate this (see Wound Dressings ). Wounds will require cleansing to remove devitalized materials as they accumulate. Not recommended for infected wounds; exceptions should be undertaken with caution.​ [40] |
| Mechanical | Mechanical forces are used to remove bacteria and nonviable tissue. These may include: Wet-to-dry dressings: A wet gauze dressing is placed on the wound bed and allowed to dry. When removed, it takes off adherent debris. Low-frequency ultrasound: Disperses bacterial biofilms and stimulates wound healing.​ [41] Wound irrigation: Wound is flushed with a cleansing solution (see Table 3 ) using a nontraumatic irrigation pressure of 8–15 psi , which may be obtained by using a 30–35 mL syringe with a 18- or 19-gauge angiocatheter, or a single-use 100 mL squeeze bottle.​ [38] Polyacrylic microfibre pads: When used in a circular motion, monofilament fibres reach into the wound bed and loosen debris and nonviable tissue. | Wet-to-dry dressings: This method is not recommended, as it causes pain and traumatizes healthy tissue.​ [42] Wound irrigation: May be useful for softening eschar.​ [2] Polyacrylic microfibre pads: Generally painless. Not commonly used in practice; more selective methods are preferred. |
| Enzymatic | Proteolytic enzymes (e.g., collagenase) are applied to the wound to break down devitalized tissues by digesting collagen fibres that attach the necrotic tissue to the wound base.​ [6] | Enzymatic agents are less effective in a dry environment; dry eschar must be scored and kept moist to maintain effectiveness.​ [6] |
| Biologic | Irradiated maggots (larvae) help débride wounds by chemically degrading and ingesting necrotic tissue.​ [42] They also secrete substances that destroy bacteria.​ [43] | Available through Health Canada’s Special Access Program . |

### Wound Dressings

For more information related to dressings, see Dressings.

Following cleansing and débridement, appropriate wound dressings are applied. Factors taken into consideration when selecting a dressing include:

- Current status of the wound (stage, healability, infection)
- Patient comfort
- Ease of use/nursing time requirements
- Cost

As wounds heal, dressing needs may change; monitor the wound at every dressing change and reassess the appropriateness of the current dressing at least once per week.​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)

Frequency of dressing changes must be individually determined:

- For uncomplicated wounds, change the dressing every 3–7 days to minimize disturbance of healing tissue
- Excessive exudate may necessitate more frequent dressing changes
- Underlying infection may necessitate more frequent dressing changes
- Dressings must be changed whenever drainage has seeped out from beneath it (as this indicates that the bacterial barrier the dressing was providing has been compromised)

### Primary Dressings

A primary dressing is one applied directly to the wound bed.

The purpose of a primary dressing is to maintain optimal moisture balance. Keeping the wound bed continuously moist but not macerated reduces pain and accelerates healing by promoting autolytic débridement (see [Table 4](#DebridementMethods-41E96567)).

Primary dressings are also used to maintain contact of an antimicrobial agent directly with the wound bed when infection is present or suspected (see [Infected Wounds](#InfectedWounds-46771243)).

### Secondary Dressings

A secondary dressing is one applied on top of a primary dressing.

The purpose of a secondary dressing is to keep the primary dressing in place and cover the wound.

Available evidence to guide dressing choice in PIs is limited and generally of low quality. No single dressing is consistently superior to others.​[[44]](#WestbyMJDumvilleJCSoaresMOEtAl.Dres-1290CA6D)​[[45]](#DumvilleJCKeoghSJLiuZ.EtAl.Alginate-6598078D)​[[46]](#DumvilleJCStubbsNKeoghSJ.EtAl.Hydro-659808E3)​[[47]](#WalkerRMGillespieBMThalibLEtAl.Foam-1EE930B6) Choose a secondary dressing that will:​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[11]](#WHS2023)​[[15]](#NortonLParslowNJohnstonDEtAl.BestPr-0CFCE1FB)

- Maintain optimal moisture balance. Keeping the wound bed continuously moist but not macerated reduces pain and accelerates healing by promoting autolytic débridement
- Be absorbent enough to control exudate but not dry out the wound bed
- Keep the surrounding skin intact and dry
- Provide thermal insulation and wound temperature stability
- Protect the wound, particularly in areas at risk of contamination due to urine or feces
- Maintain its integrity and not leave fibres or foreign substances within the wound
- Minimize friction, shearing, skin irritation and additional pressure on wound and adjacent tissue
- Not cause trauma to the wound bed on removal

When applying a secondary dressing:​[[48]](#c0067n00108)

- It is optimal to cover about 3 cm of intact, dry skin around the wound
- Ensure the dressing does not exert tension on the skin, as the resulting shearing forces increase the risk of further tissue breakdown

### Dressing Types

**Table 5:** Dressing Types Used in Pressure Injuries​[[49]](#WoundsCanada.ProductPickerWoundDres-42F59BC0)

| Classification | Description | Indications | Contraindications | Moisture Absorption​[50] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alginates | Sheets or fibrous ropes of glucuronic acid and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (seaweed derivative) Hemostatic capabilities A characteristic unpleasant odour, created as the dressing absorbs exudate, is noticeable at dressing changes and may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection | Moderate to high levels of exudate Local hemostasis Facilitating autolytic débridement Filling of dead space in wound | Dry wounds Narrow or deep sinuses Heavy or uncontrolled bleeding | +++ |
| Foams | Adherent or nonadherent (with or without adhesive border) polyurethane foam Products have varying moisture vapour transmission rates | Low to moderate levels of exudate Facilitating autolytic débridement | Highly exudating wounds (requiring dressing changes ≥once daily) Ischemic nonhealable wounds | ++ |
| Gauze | Bleached fabric made from fibres of cotton, rayon or polyester Woven or nonwoven (the latter being more absorbent and less likely to shed lint) | Low to high levels of exudate Filling dead space in wounds Delivering pastes, ointments, gels Cleansing periwound tissue (the surrounding skin extending from a wound bed) Absorbing wound cleansers Mechanical débridement (not recommended) |  | + |
| Hydrocolloids | Occlusive sheet dressings with polyurethane outer layer May contain gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or pectin A characteristic unpleasant odour, created as the dressing absorbs exudate, is noticeable at dressing changes and may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection | Low levels of exudate Facilitating autolytic débridement | Moderate to high levels of exudate Infected wounds Deep cavities Dry lower limb wounds with arterial insufficiency​ [38] | + |
| Hydrogels | Polymers with high water content (30–90%) May contain pectin, collagen and preservatives Come as gels, solid sheets or embedded into gauze | Adding moisture to wounds with no or minimal levels of exudate Facilitating autolytic débridement | Moderate to high levels of exudate Infected wounds Dry lower limb wounds with arterial insufficiency​ [38] | – |
| Transparent films | Transparent, semi-permeable polyurethane adhesive sheets Products have varying moisture vapour transmission rates Impermeable to liquid and bacterial infiltration | Cover for showering Protecting skin at risk of pressure or friction injury Secondary dressing or fixation device Facilitating autolytic débridement | Moderate to high levels of exudate Infected wounds Deep cavities | Neutral |

### Infected Wounds

Diagnosing infection in a PI does not rely on the typical signs of cellulitis (erythema, edema and warmth), as these are likely absent. Diagnosis is based on both the clinical picture and culture results. Possible clinical signs and symptoms of infection are:​[[6]](#RegisteredNursesAssociationOfOntari-0CF40F45)​[[12]](#c0067n00133)

- Wound is not healing as expected
- Wound becomes more painful​[[51]](#ReddyMGillSSWuWEtAl.DoesThisPatient-4C37DC6B)
- Increased amount of exudate being produced
- Development of a foul odour

If infection is suspected clinically, culture the wound. Because all pressure-related wounds contain bacteria, qualitative wound cultures are not diagnostic of infection; quantitative cultures showing heavy growth are considered indicative of infection if occurring in combination with clinical signs and symptoms. It is important to note that antibiotic resistance is a common concern for chronic PIs; one study showed that 10% of patients admitted to a tertiary care rehabilitation hospital with spinal injuries and subsequent PIs had multidrug- or pandrug-resistant organisms isolated from their wound(s).​[[52]](#Binsuwaidan-5E976904)

A correctly performed wound swab is easier and less invasive than wound tissue biopsy and has been shown to provide comparable results.​[[53]](#LevineNSLindbergRBMasonADEtAl.TheQu-4686670C) The recommended swabbing method for obtaining a quantitative wound culture is the Levine technique, which involves applying a culture swab to a cleaned area of the wound with enough pressure to extrude fluid from the wound over 5 seconds.​[[53]](#LevineNSLindbergRBMasonADEtAl.TheQu-4686670C) It can be painful for the patient.

Topical **antimicrobial agents** (e.g., povidone/​iodine, chlorhexidine, gentian violet, honey, silver), used in conjunction with a primary dressing, are indicated:

- To reduce bacterial burden and/or disrupt biofilms in locally infected wounds
- In combination with systemic antibiotics for spreading or systemic infection
- To prevent infection in nonhealing or nonhealable wounds (see [Assessment](#Treatment_Assessments-A32B7792))

A systematic review was not able to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of one topical antimicrobial agent over another due to the quality of the evidence available.​[[54]](#NormanGDumvilleJCMooreZEEtAl.Antibi-10993FA5)

Antimicrobial dressings must come into direct contact with the wound bed to be effective. Use for at least 2 weeks before assessing effectiveness, and discontinue use once the wound no longer appears to be infected. Antimicrobials are available in many formats, including pastes and powders or impregnated in dressings such as alginates, foams, gauzes, gels, gelling fibres, hydrocolloids and nonadherent synthetic contact layers (see [Table 5](#DressingTypes-42F2258E) and [Table 6](#AntimicrobialAgentsUsedWithWoundDre-42F936BA)).

Consider starting broad-spectrum **systemic antibiotics** if a spreading or systemic infection is suspected, and adjust therapy based on culture and sensitivities. See Acute Osteomyelitis, Bacterial Skin Infections and Diabetic Foot Infections for more information.

**Table 6:** Antimicrobial Agents Used with Wound Dressings​[[49]](#WoundsCanada.ProductPickerWoundDres-42F59BC0)

| Classification | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Gentian violet/methylene blue | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial action |
| Honey | Must be medical grade. Leptospernum species medical grade honey dressings are more effective than other types of honey dressings​ [55] |
| Iodine (povidone and cadexomer) | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial action Contraindicated before/after use of radioactive iodine, in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, renal disorders Use with caution in thyroid disorders, deep ulcerative wounds |
| Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial action |
| Silver | Available in both salt and metallic forms |

### Other Wound-Care Treatments

Many other therapies for wound healing are suggested or promoted but lack adequate randomized controlled trial evidence of safety and effectiveness. These include, among others:

- **Surgical reconstruction** involving débridement and construction of skin flaps over the wound may be considered for stage 3 or 4 injuries that are not healing if the patient can tolerate anesthetic and postoperative rehabilitation.​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)​[[56]](#WongJKAminKDumvilleJC.Reconstructin-49A694D4)
- **Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)** is widely used and promoted despite limited evidence of effectiveness.​[[57]](#Shi-5F054A50) A machine attached to a wound dressing covering the PI drains and removes infectious material, wound exudate and debris by generating carefully controlled suction (negative pressure). It is thought that this will increase angiogenesis and formation of granulation tissue. Use of NPWT may allow the frequency of dressing changes to be reduced to every 2–3 days. It is contraindicated in PIs complicated by untreated osteomyelitis, untreated fistulas or in close proximity to vessels where large amounts of bleeding could occur.​[[58]](#HuangCLeavittTBayerLREtAl.EffectOfN-4A14532A)
- **Ultrasound therapy** involves the use of low-level ultrasound on the PI area. Ultrasound waves may have a positive or negative effect on blood flow but the mechanism by which the treatment may affect healing is unclear and there is little evidence of benefit available.​[[59]](#Baba-AkbariSariAFlemmingKCullumNAEt-4A17471E)
- **Electrical stimulation** (ES) devices deliver painless electric pulses to a wound, which is thought to speed healing by increasing capillary density and perfusion and increasing oxygenation, granulation and fibroblast activity.​[[60]](#KlothLC.HowToUseElectricalStimulati-4A1F770F) A systematic review found that ES probably increases the proportion of PIs healed as well as the rate of healing,​[[61]](#AroraMHarveyLAGlinskyJVEtAl.Electri-4A201834) but the evidence so far is considered insufficient to support widespread use.​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)​[[61]](#AroraMHarveyLAGlinskyJVEtAl.Electri-4A201834)
- **Electromagnetic therapy** may improve healing of chronic wounds by producing an electromagnetic field across the wound which is theorized to facilitate several biological processes involved in wound repair including the migration of electrically charged cells. A systematic review found the evidence was too limited to draw any conclusions about effectiveness.​[[62]](#AzizZBell-SyerSEM.ElectromagneticTh-4A23FDEC)
- **Ultraviolet radiation** phototherapy is theorized to stimulate photochemical reactions that are involved in cell migration and wound repair. It has been used to promote wound healing; however, the evidence is limited and of low quality and further research is required.​[[63]](#ChenCHouWChanEEtAl.PhototherapyForT-94DCA6F0)
- **Hyperbaric oxygen** is postulated to improve oxygen supply to wounds and therefore improve their healing; however, there are no randomized studies assessing its effects in patients with PIs and its use cannot be recommended.​[[8]](#HealthQualityOntario.QualityStandar-D9EDAD3D)​[[64]](#KrankePBennettMHMartyn-St.JamesMEtA-4A25708E)​[[65]](#ReddyM.PressureUlcersTreatment.BMJC-4A25B9E8)
- **Anabolic steroids** have been studied for the treatment of PIs due to their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass, but a systematic review found there is no high-quality evidence to support their use.​[[66]](#NaingCWhittakerMA.AnabolicSteroidsF-4A260FDF)
