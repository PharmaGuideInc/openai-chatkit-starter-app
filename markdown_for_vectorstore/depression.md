### Introduction

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), depressive disorders include​[[1]](#c0005n00024):

- Major depressive disorder (MDD)
- Persistent depressive disorder
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
- Substance-induced mood disorder (caused by substances such as alcohol or medications)
- Mood disorder due to a general medical condition (when the depression is thought to be a direct physiological consequence of the medical disorder)
- Other specified depressive disorder (depressive episodes deviating from the precise criteria for MDD)
- Unspecified depressive disorder

This chapter primarily focuses on major depressive disorder and persistent depression disorder.

Major depressive episodes may be single or, more often, recurrent; see [Table 1](#c0005n00003) for diagnostic criteria. Persistent depressive disorder, or dysthymia, is a consolidation of dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder. In contrast to MDD, the symptoms of persistent depressive disorder are typically fewer and less severe. The diagnostic criteria of persistent depressive disorder include depressed mood for at least 2 years *and* at least 2 of the following: increased or decreased appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, reduced energy or fatigue, reduced self-esteem, reduced concentration or ability to make decisions, and hopelessness.​[[1]](#c0005n00024)

The lifetime prevalence of MDD in Canada is approximately 10% and the annual prevalence of a major depressive episode is just under 5%. Depression has a negative impact on work productivity and accounts for over 5% of illness-related productivity loss. Not surprisingly, MDD is also associated with serious impairment in quality of life and a high economic burden.​[[2]](#LamRWMcIntoshDWangJEtAl.CanadianNet-AA01023C)

### Goals of Therapy

- Achieve remission of depressive symptoms
- Treat concomitant symptoms/disorders
- Prevent suicide
- Restore optimal functioning
- Prevent recurrence

### Investigations

The following screening questions/assessment tools are recommended for use by primary health-care professionals:

- The [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a0df2b3692ebe9b1a7973e0/t/5b04613603ce64928f7a76eb/1527013686324/PHQ-9.pdf)​[[3]](#c0005n00026) is a patient-rated assessment tool that consists of 9 questions that correspond to the DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode.​[[4]](#SpitzerRLWilliamsJBKroenkeKEtAl.Tes-AC0CA0CB) The first 2 questions from the PHQ-9 serve as a useful and rapid screening tool:​[[5]](#c0005n00174)

  - During the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
  - During the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?
- The [Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16)](http://www.ids-qids.org) is a widely used alternative to the PHQ-9. It is available in multiple languages, takes less than 10 minutes to complete and consists of 16 multiple choice questions that cover DSM-5 criteria.
- The 7-item [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7)](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/173/11/1327.full.pdf)​[[6]](#c0005n00027) is a validated, brief, health-care professional assessment designed to rate severity and remission.
- The [Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a0df2b3692ebe9b1a7973e0/t/5b045ebe352f530afd6ae95e/1527013055374/Mood+Disorder+Questionnaire+(MDQ).pdf)​[[7]](#c0005n00216) is a useful screening instrument for manic or hypomanic symptoms.
- The [Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)](https://greenspacehealth.com/en-ca/postnatal-depression-epds/)​[[8]](#c0005n00267) is the most widely used and well-validated tool to screen for depressive symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
- [MoodFx](https://www.moodfx.ca/About-Us) is a free website that offers tools for patients to use in measurement-based care—the use of measurement tools to assess disease progress and aid in therapeutic decisions.

As part of a standard diagnostic interview, it is important to screen for current prescription medicines that may be associated with depressive symptoms (e.g., oral contraceptives, analgesics, proton pump inhibitors, antihypertensives).​[[9]](#QatoDMOzenbergerKOlfsonM.Prevalence-3F5D3175) It is also important to recognize that patients with bipolar disorder often present to health-care providers for the first time during a major depressive episode. As such, primary care physicians should assess those presenting with depression for a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. The treatment of bipolar depression requires different strategies than that of MDD; see Bipolar Disorder for more information.

Once a diagnosis of depression is confirmed, baseline and ongoing monitoring parameters are recommended; see [Table 2](#table-1625-980D3202) for more information.

**Table 1:** Diagnostic Criteria of Major Depressive Disorder​[[1]](#c0005n00024)

| A. | Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.​ [a] Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: in children and adolescents, can be irritable mood Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation) Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: in children, consider failure to make expected weight gain Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down) Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick) Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either subjective account or as observed by others) Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. |
| B. | The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.​ [a] |
| C. | The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition.​ [a] ​ [b] |
| D. | At least one major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. |
| E. | There has never been a manic or hypomanic episode. Note: this exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effect of another medical condition. |

[a] Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.

[b] Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.

### Therapeutic Choices

The main evidence for guideline-based treatment recommendations comes from studies of middle-aged patients; however, MDD occurs across the lifespan and presents specific challenges that need to be addressed in children and youth, people later in life, and patients in the perinatal and menopausal stages of life. The CANMAT 2016 clinical guidelines for MDD summarize the treatment protocol for each of these stages.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7)

The most impressive evidence for the success of pharmacologic and depression-specific psychological therapies, in terms of both clinical efficacy and restoration of occupational functioning, comes from controlled trials involving multifaceted health-system interventions.​[[12]](#c0005n00067)​[[13]](#c0005n00068) These interventions, tested mostly in primary care settings, involve primary care physicians working in conjunction with another health-care provider (e.g., pharmacist, nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist); the prescriber initiates the antidepressants while the other practitioner educates the patient about depression and monitors the progress during treatment.​[[14]](#c0005n00069)​[[15]](#c0005n00070) Multifaceted interventions (nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic) can substantially reduce long-term expense and increase the likelihood of the patient returning to work.​[[16]](#HuJWuTDamodaranSEtAl.TheEffectivene-98C0AD91)​[[17]](#XiaoLQiHZhengWEtAl.TheEffectiveness-98C0CAEF)​[[18]](#OverbeckGDavidsenAKousgaardM.Enable-98C0E270)​[[19]](#GilbodySBowerPFletcherJEtAl.Collabo-98C11F79)​[[20]](#MoriartyASCoventryPAHudsonJLEtAl.Th-98C1476A) Unfortunately not all clinicians and patients have access to these resources.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Psychotherapy

While pharmacotherapy is preferable in severe depression and also when comorbid personality disorders are present, psychotherapies are as effective as medication for depression of mild to moderate severity.​[[21]](#ParikhSVQuiltyLCRavitzPEtAl.Canadia-AC100163) Cognitive behavioural therapy **(CBT)**, behavioural activation **(BA)** and interpersonal therapy **(IPT)** are considered first-line recommendations for treating depression.​[[21]](#ParikhSVQuiltyLCRavitzPEtAl.Canadia-AC100163)

Each type of intervention has subtle advantages in specific circumstances, and patient preferences are important to consider. Interpersonal therapy may be preferable when major interpersonal issues are present. Newer versions of CBT and IPT have evolved and show particular promise: *mindfulness-based CBT* (mCBT) is particularly effective in preventing relapse into depression​[[22]](#c0005n00284) and *acceptance and commitment therapy* (ACT) has some efficacy in acute depression.​[[23]](#c0005n00285) It is also important to consider the significance of therapist cultural competence in delivering care to racialized groups.​[[24]](#EkenHNDeeECPowersAREtAl.RacialAndEt-980FAC23)

### Technology-Based Psychotherapy

Cognitive behavioural therapy is also available on the internet and through mobile applications, in some cases for a modest fee (e.g., [BEACON](https://www.mindbeacon.com/), [Beating the Blues](http://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk/), [Moodgym](http://www.moodgym.com.au) and [Living Life](http://www.llttf.com/)).​[[25]](#ApaydinEAMaherARRaaenLEtAl.TheUseOf-3F5F31FA) Multiple meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of web-based CBT;​[[26]](#KaryotakiERiperHTwiskJEtAl.Efficacy-3F5F85CC) unguided self-help may be less effective than guided self-help, particularly in individuals with moderate-to-severe depression.​[[27]](#c0005n00286)​[[28]](#KaryotakiEEfthimiouOMiguelCEtAl.Int-9812D76E) Patients should be encouraged to complete the modules and simple homework exercises on these sites in tandem with attending routine clinical care visits.

### Motivational Interviewing

Motivational interviewing is a type of psychotherapy intended to improve the patient’s motivation to change problematic behaviour. It is strikingly effective for treatment of substance abuse when depression is also present.​[[21]](#ParikhSVQuiltyLCRavitzPEtAl.Canadia-AC100163) Its effects are primarily on the substance abuse, not on the depressive symptoms.

### Psychoeducation

In addition to psychotherapy, measures to enhance adherence to antidepressant therapy are useful. Psychoeducation with the following 5 simple messages is effective:​[[29]](#c0005n00030)

- Take medication daily.
- Call your prescriber or pharmacist for questions about side effects or other issues.
- Remember that it may take 2–4 weeks to see a noticeable effect from antidepressants.
- Continue to take medication even if you are feeling better.
- Do not stop taking your antidepressant without checking with your prescriber.

### Other Nonpharmacologic Therapy

There is evidence for the benefit of regular physical exercise and yoga as monotherapy in mild to moderate depression and as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy in moderate to severe depression.​[[30]](#RavindranAVBalneavesLGFaulknerGEtAl-A68158F5)​[[31]](#MorresIDHatzigeorgiadisAStathiAEtAl-3F603B85) Although there are few well-controlled studies of diet modification in the treatment of depression, a proof-of-concept RCT demonstrated feasibility of and positive outcomes for a dietary intervention that mainly reduced refined and processed foods while increasing healthier options (e.g., fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, nuts/seeds, olive oil).​[[32]](#FrancisHMStevensonRJChambersJREtAl.-98133233)

Light therapy is considered a first-line option for MDD with a seasonal pattern or as an adjunct measure for nonseasonal MDD of mild to moderate severity.​[[30]](#RavindranAVBalneavesLGFaulknerGEtAl-A68158F5)​[[33]](#TuunainenAKripkeDFEndoT.LightTherap-BE233CAA)​[[34]](#EvenCSchroderCMFriedmanSEtAl.Effica-BE233E4F) In a randomized controlled trial, a combination of fluoxetine and light therapy demonstrated higher remission rates than either modality alone in patients with nonseasonal MDD.​[[35]](#LamRWLevittAJLevitanRDEtAl.Efficacy-BE234005) Light therapy involves exposure to a light box with 10 000-lux intensity slanted toward the face for 30 minutes per day, preferably in the morning. Improvement in depressive symptoms usually occurs within 1–3 weeks. Side effects of light therapy (e.g., headache, eye strain, irritability, insomnia) are usually mild and do not lead to treatment discontinuation. These can be minimized by having patients start with 10–15 minutes of exposure per day and gradually increase to 30 minutes per day. Patients with eye conditions that make them more vulnerable to light should check with their eye-care practitioner before starting light therapy. Light boxes with UV filters are recommended.

**Novel neurostimulation therapies** are proliferating as adjunctive strategies to treat depression. These include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation, which have increasingly been evaluated but are not routinely available.​[[36]](#MutzJVipulanathanVCarterBEtAl.Compa-7BA6B80E)​[[37]](#MilevRVGiacobbePKennedySHEtAl.Canad-AC0F80D0)

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0005n00013) illustrates an algorithm for the pharmacologic management of depression with or without a remission of symptoms.

Although diagnostic criteria for MDD and persistent depressive disorder (see [Table 1](#c0005n00003)) differ, recommendations for the use of antidepressants are the same in both conditions. [Table 3](#c0005n00303) lists first-, second- and third-line antidepressants according to the 2016 CANMAT guidelines.​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994) [Table 6](#c0005n00018) provides more details about the drugs used to treat depression. A minimum therapeutic dose should be achieved in the first 2 weeks of treatment and increased if necessary over the next 4–6 weeks. Patients need to be informed of common side effects and that some of these unwanted effects usually subside within 2 weeks (see [Table 4](#2DC9445F)). Consider switching within the same class during weeks 3–8 if a favourable response is overshadowed by persistent and troublesome side effects that do not respond to measures such as adjusting the dose or time of administration.

A network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants involving over 100 000 patients confirmed superiority over placebo for all included agents and identified the following agents as more effective than other antidepressants: agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine and vortioxetine.​[[39]](#c0005n00268) When acceptability (based on drop-out rates) was considered, the leading agents were agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline and vortioxetine. Based on this systematic review, agomelatine, escitalopram and vortioxetine appear to be 3 of the most effective and well-tolerated options.​[[40]](#ParikhSVKennedySH.MoreDataMoreAnswe-9D1F23C0) Agomelatine is not available in Canada.

A systematic review of observational studies involving more than 200 000 adults in mid- and late-life with moderate to severe depression found that exposure to SSRIs reduced the risk of suicide by more than 40% and 50%, in the respective age groups.​[[41]](#BarbuiCEspositoECiprianiA.Selective-2DC6D830)

In contrast, regulatory authorities have issued cautions that highlight the potential of antidepressants to increase suicidal ideation, particularly in children and young adults. Clinicians are faced with complex decisions about when to use CBT and/or pharmacotherapy to treat depression in younger age groups and are advised to monitor patients carefully for any emergent suicidal ideation or acts, particularly during the early phase of treatment.​[[42]](#c0005n01122) The risk of emergent or worsening suicidal ideation must be weighed against the risks associated with untreated depression (suicide, increased duration and severity of illness, higher incidence of relapse).

**Table 3:** CANMAT Classification of Antidepressants​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994)

| First-Line Agents ​ [a] | bupropion citalopram desvenlafaxine duloxetine escitalopram fluoxetine fluvoxamine mirtazapine paroxetine sertraline venlafaxine vortioxetine | Second-Line Agents ​ [a] | levomilnacipran moclobemide quetiapine trazodone tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline, trimipramine) vilazodone |
| Third-Line Agents ​ [a] | phenelzine tranylcypromine |

[a] Within each category, antidepressants are listed in alphabetical order rather than in order of preference.

### Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

SSRIs are first-choice antidepressants due to greater tolerability, ease of dosing and relatively low cost. Both time to onset (2–4 weeks) and rate of response (60–70%) are comparable to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); side effects mainly affect the GI tract, the CNS and sexual function.​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994) SSRIs can increase the risk of GI bleeding, particularly in patients with additional risk factors such as concomitant NSAID therapy or a history of GI bleeding. They should be used with caution in patients already at higher risk of GI bleeding.​[[43]](#c0005n00295) Unlike GI or CNS side effects, sexual dysfunction is more likely to persist during SSRI therapy and can involve impairment of desire, arousal and/or orgasm/ejaculation; there are also unsubstantiated reports of persisting sexual dysfunction following discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs.​[[44]](#HealthCanada.SummarySafetyReview-Se-9813D298) Consider the importance of sexual function to the patient when prescribing an antidepressant. Non-SSRI antidepressants that cause less sexual dysfunction (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine, moclobemide) may be more acceptable for some patients.​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994)

Six SSRIs are currently available in Canada (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline). Escitalopram, the stereoisomer of citalopram, has a similar side effect profile but superior efficacy to citalopram​[[45]](#c0005n00035) and is at least as effective as venlafaxine.​[[46]](#c0005n00178) With the exception of fluoxetine, all SSRIs are commonly associated with discontinuation effects when stopping therapy. See [Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome](#c0005n01091) for more information. These effects can be severe and protracted in a small proportion of patients. Patients should be assessed regularly during and after treatment discontinuation for withdrawal symptoms and relapse.

### Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)

Venlafaxine has inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake at any therapeutic dose. At doses of >150 mg daily, it also inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. Compared with SSRIs, rates of remission have been reported to be 6–10% higher with venlafaxine, although these results are mainly based on comparisons with fluoxetine.​[[47]](#c0005n00042)​[[48]](#c0005n00269) Dose-related hypertension occurs rarely and is more likely to be seen at doses ≥225 mg. Monitor BP and avoid use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Desvenlafaxine is the active metabolite of venlafaxine and may have a decreased risk of serious drug interactions. In the treatment of depression, the response and remission rates are comparable to venlafaxine. Desvenlafaxine is one of the few antidepressants to have been systematically evaluated and found to be efficacious in peri- and postmenopausal patients.​[[49]](#KornsteinSGClaytonAHBaoWEtAl.APoole-AA061CF2) Common adverse effects include insomnia, somnolence, dizziness and nausea.​[[50]](#c0005n00296)​[[51]](#c0005n00297)

Duloxetine appears to exert effects on both serotonin and norepinephrine systems at the starting dose of 60 mg daily and has comparable efficacy to venlafaxine.​[[52]](#c0005n00288) In addition to depression, duloxetine is indicated for neuropathic pain and for pain associated with fibromyalgia. Isolated cases of hepatic injury have been reported but there is no requirement for routine monitoring of liver enzymes. It is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, of which tobacco smoke is a potent inducer; therefore, cigarette smokers are likely to have lower plasma levels and may require higher dosing of duloxetine.​[[53]](#AugustinMSchoretsanitisGHiemkeCEtAl-2DC84C12)

Levomilnacipran has higher potency for norepinephrine than serotonin reuptake inhibition (2:1). In the treatment of depression, the response and remission rates were 45% and 28%, respectively. Common adverse effects include nausea, headache, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, constipation and dizziness. Blood pressure and heart rate may increase and should be carefully monitored.​[[54]](#CitromeL.LevomilnacipranForMajorDep-F43AD015)

### Dual Action Antidepressants

Bupropion is thought to exert antidepressant effects through norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition.​[[55]](#c0005n00036) It is a first-line agent for MDD and is also indicated for smoking cessation under a different brand name.​[[56]](#c0005n00037) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold in a dose-dependent manner. It is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or recent history of anorexia or bulimia nervosa, and should be used with extreme caution where there is a history of head trauma or seizure. Patients should be aware that the use of the medication with alcohol may lower seizure threshold. Treatment-emergent GI disturbance and sexual dysfunction occurs less frequently with bupropion compared with SSRIs.​[[57]](#c0005n00032)

Mirtazapine acts on both the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. It has a lower rate of GI and sexual side effects but is associated with sedation and weight gain.​[[58]](#c0005n00043)

### Other Serotonin Modulators

Trazodone is a potent postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT2) receptor antagonist with weak serotonin reuptake inhibitory effects.​[[59]](#c0005n00038) Because of severe daytime sedation, trazodone is rarely prescribed at therapeutic antidepressant doses (300–400 mg daily) but is often prescribed at lower doses (50–100 mg) as a hypnotic in combination with other antidepressants.​[[60]](#c0005n01098) Tolerance, as seen with benzodiazepines, does not develop with trazodone and there is the potential for trazodone to enhance antidepressant effects.

Vortioxetine is a novel serotonergic antidepressant;​[[61]](#c0005n01120) its mechanism of action is thought to involve a combination of direct 5-HT receptor modulation and serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibition. In patients with MDD, vortioxetine has also shown positive effects on neuropsychological performance in multiple cognitive domains.​[[62]](#RosenblatJDKakarRMcIntyreRS.TheCogn-AA07440C) In clinical trials, the most common side effects were GI-related. Mild to moderate nausea, typically in the first week of treatment, is usually self-resolving. The incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction and disrupted sleep may be lower with vortioxetine compared with SSRIs.​[[63]](#c0005n01123) However, patients should still be monitored for these adverse effects.

Vilazodone is a multimodal antidepressant that acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a partial agonist at 5-HT1A. Vilazodone should be taken with food to ensure adequate absorption and a titration schedule is recommended to avoid GI effects. Nausea, diarrhea and headache are the most prominent adverse effects. Sexual side effects occur less frequently with vilazodone compared to SSRIs.

### Tricyclic Antidepressants

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are generally reserved as second-line medications; their mechanism involves inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin to varying degrees. Amitriptyline is the most frequently prescribed TCA, often at considerably lower doses of 25–50 mg per day for nighttime sedation or analgesia. Nortriptyline, a metabolite of amitriptyline and a secondary amine, has been used to treat depression in older populations for many years. Clomipramine, the most serotonergic TCA, is still favoured in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. In all cases, TCA use is limited by tolerability and safety concerns, especially cardiotoxicity following overdose.

### Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

Prescribing irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and tranylcypromine is generally reserved for specialized mood disorder clinics because these agents are associated with potentially fatal food and drug interactions (hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome). Nevertheless, all prescribers and pharmacists should be aware of these risks and how they can be avoided when faced with a patient taking an irreversible MAOI. Despite the potential risks, under careful conditions, MAOIs may prove effective where other antidepressants have failed.

Moclobemide, a reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitor, does not require dietary restrictions when prescribed within the recommended dose range. Moclobemide is a well-tolerated alternative to SSRI or SNRI agents, particularly in patients with a significant anxiety component to their depressive episode. Although moclobemide is often perceived as being less effective than irreversible MAOIs, this has not been substantiated in clinical trials.

### Antidepressant Adverse Effects

**Table 4:** Management of Treatment Emergent Adverse Effects of Antidepressant Therapy​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994)[[64]](#MalhiGSBassettDBoycePEtAl.RoyalAust-2DCA0EC5)[[65]](#TarletonEKKenedyAGDaleyC.PrimerForN-2DCA33D9)[[66]](#GafoorRBoothHPGullifordMC.Antidepre-2DCA5A53)[[67]](#JacobsenPLMahableshwarkarARChenYEtA-2DCA873C)[[68]](#ClaytonAKornsteinSPrakashAEtAl.Chan-2DCAAD25)[[69]](#TaylorMJRudkinLBullemor-DayPEtAl.St-2DCACED9)[[70]](#FoongALGrindrodKAPatelTEtAl.Demysti-2DCAEDF8)

| The adverse effects listed in this table may occur with all antidepressants unless otherwise stated. The individual agents identified below are among the more commonly used antidepressants that have the highest prevalence of the listed adverse effect. Incidence rates are included when available. General management: If adverse effects are severe, persist for longer than 2 weeks or are intolerable to the patient, consider (1) lowering dose or (2) switching agent. |
| Adverse Effect | Management | Prevalence |
| GI upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea) | Usually diminishes after 1–2 wk of therapy Nausea : once-daily dosing; take with food; have small, frequent meals; avoid strong smells Constipation : increase fibre intake, fluids, laxatives, exercise Diarrhea : have small, frequent meals; take probiotics; limit caffeine, alcohol, spicy food; fluid replacement | Nausea : fluvoxamine (37%), venlafaxine (37%), paroxetine (26%), sertraline (26%), vilazodone (24%), vortioxetine (23%), citalopram (21%), desvenlafaxine (22%), fluoxetine (21%), duloxetine (20%) Constipation : fluvoxamine (18%), venlafaxine (15%), paroxetine (14%), duloxetine (11%) Diarrhea : vilazodone (29%), sertraline (18%), paroxetine (11%) |

### Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome

Rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of most antidepressants may be associated with discontinuation syndrome.​[[72]](#c0005n01092) This syndrome is often reported with SSRIs, likely because these drugs are the most frequently prescribed, but any antidepressant taken for 6 weeks or more may be associated with discontinuation-related symptoms. Patients taking agents with a shorter half-life (e.g., paroxetine, venlafaxine) are at greatest risk of discontinuation-emergent symptoms, which include anxiety, crying, headache, increased dreaming, insomnia, irritability, myoclonus, nausea, electric shocks, tremor, flulike symptoms, imbalance and sensory disturbance.

Patients experience somatic, neurologic and psychological symptoms attributed to a rapid decrease in the availability of 5-HT​[[73]](#RenoirT.SelectiveSerotoninReuptakeI-AC11A33A) within 1–7 days of stopping the drug. If untreated, symptoms typically last between 3 days and 3 weeks, but may occasionally persist for several months.​[[74]](#DaviesJReadJ.ASystematicReviewIntoT-3F611157)

Inform patients that discontinuation syndrome may occur if they abruptly stop or reduce the dose of their medication. Taper antidepressant doses gradually by approximately 25% per week and monitor for a re-emergence of depressive symptoms.​[[72]](#c0005n01092) Fluoxetine has a long half-life and can be tapered more rapidly than other SSRIs.

Reassure patients who experience discontinuation syndrome that the condition is not serious or life-threatening and severe symptoms will usually resolve in 3 days or less. The syndrome can be reversed by restarting the antidepressant and tapering the dose more slowly. Alternatively, if a slow taper is poorly tolerated, substitute with 1 dose of fluoxetine 10–20 mg PO. If discontinuation-emergent symptoms have not resolved after several days, additional doses of fluoxetine 20 mg may be taken if necessary; a total of 3 doses spread over 7–10 days is considered acceptable. Consider a herbal product containing ginger if drug interactions or adverse effects limit use of other possible antinausea medications (see Nausea and Vomiting).​[[75]](#NaturalMedicinesComprehensiveDataba-AC124188)

There is some evidence that cognitive or mindfulness-based therapies combined with tapering may lessen the discontinuation-emergent effects.​[[76]](#MaundEStuartBMooreMEtAl.ManagingAnt-7C9D1A0C)​[[77]](#BreedveltJJFWarrenFCSegalZEtAl.Cont-98469B0A) Another novel approach used in the Netherlands involves the use of extemporaneously packaged pills in dose decrements as small as 0.5 mg to be used over several weeks.​[[78]](#GrootPCVanOsJ.AntidepressantTaperin-7C9D48EC)

### Atypical Antipsychotics

Extended-release quetiapine, a second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotic agent, has been approved in Canada for the treatment of depression and is considered to be a second-line option.​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994)​[[79]](#CutlerAJMontgomerySAFeifelDEtAl.Ext-AC1207CF) Immediate-release quetiapine is also used (off-label) for this indication but is associated with greater sedation.​[[80]](#BuiKEarleyWNybergS.PharmacokineticP-7CA0C5E0)

Aripiprazole and brexpiprazole are approved as adjuncts to antidepressants in adults with MDD who have not had an adequate response to an antidepressant alone during the current episode. Olanzapine and risperidone are also used (off-label) for treatment-resistant depression.

Response to antipsychotics should generally be observed within 2 weeks of initiation. See [Treatment-Resistant Depression](#c0005n00012) for information regarding the role of antipsychotics in the treatment of depression.

### Natural Health Products

Several natural health products have been evaluated for the treatment of depression. It is important to consider potential drug interactions with these products since many should not be used in combination with prescription antidepressants. See [Table 6](#c0005n00018) for more information.

There is some evidence to support St. John’s wort as a potential monotherapy option for patients with MDD of mild to moderate severity.​[[30]](#RavindranAVBalneavesLGFaulknerGEtAl-A68158F5)​[[81]](#SarrisJRavindranAYathamLNEtAl.Clini-12C2D65D) As an inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, St. John’s wort can decrease the bioavailability of many drugs. When combined with other serotonergic medications, there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Consider potential interactions before recommending this agent.

S-adenosylmethionine **(SAM-e)**, a synthetic form of a dietary amino acid, has been evaluated as adjunctive and monotherapy with limited evidence to support its use in MDD.​[[81]](#SarrisJRavindranAYathamLNEtAl.Clini-12C2D65D) SAM-e is well tolerated with few adverse effects, but may be associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic drugs.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been recommended as second-line therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate depression.​[[30]](#RavindranAVBalneavesLGFaulknerGEtAl-A68158F5) However, a meta-analysis suggests that the evidence to support their use is of low quality and the benefits are not clinically significant.​[[82]](#DeaneKHOJimohOFBiswasPEtAl.Omega-3A-984761FD)

Studies have looked at the efficacy of supplementation with folic acid and vitamin D for depression in adults. Folic acid was not effective when used to augment antidepressant medications;​[[83]](#c0005n01103) however, adjunctive **L-methylfolate**, a form of folate that crosses the blood–brain–barrier, 15 mg/day showed significantly greater efficacy as adjunctive therapy with SSRIs compared with SSRIs alone.​[[84]](#c0005n01099) There is preliminary evidence that L-carnosine, a polypeptide with antioxidant properties, may produce favourable antidepressant augmentation effects.​[[85]](#AraminiaBShalbafanMMortezaeiAEtAl.L-9847FCE6) Despite the low quality of evidence and need for more robust studies, a systematic review determined that vitamin D supplementation in adults with depression had no significant effect.​[[86]](#c0005n01104)

### Rapid-Acting Therapy

Rapid-acting therapy is an emerging therapeutic class for the treatment of depression; these are treatments that yield improvement in symptoms within days and may be given for a short duration. These agents are part of a paradigm shift in the treatment of depression, particularly treatment-resistant depression. Examples include NMDA-modulators​[[87]](#SwainsonJMcGirrABlierPEtAl.TheCanad-98935628) (ketamine, esketamine, dextromethorphan/bupropion​[[88]](#IosifescuDVJonesAOGormanCEtAl.Effic-12C47695)), GABAA-modulators (brexanolone​[[89]](#KanesSColquhounHGunduz-BruceHEtAl.B-12C46399), zuranolone​[[90]](#DeligiannidisKMMeltzer-BrodySGunduz-12C48FD3)) and the Stanford TMS protocol. Ketamine and esketamine are available in Canada; brexanolone and dextromethorphan/bupropion are available in the U.S.

### Duration of Treatment—Relapse Prevention

Experts recommend the use of maintenance antidepressant therapies for a minimum period of 9 months, particularly when the intervals between depressive episodes become shorter and the disability associated with each depressive episode worsens. After achieving remission in a first episode, treat for 9 months. Patients may be at risk of recurrence if they have psychiatric or other comorbidities; residual symptoms; or if episodes are frequent, recurrent, chronic, severe or difficult to treat (see [Figure 1](#c0005n00013)). In these cases, treat for at least 2 years. Long-term maintenance treatment may also be considered.​[[91]](#LewisGMarstonLDuffyLEtAl.Maintenanc-9848D827)

In general, taper antidepressants slowly to minimize the risk of discontinuation-emergent symptoms. See [Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome](#c0005n01091) for more information.

Cognitive behavioural therapy and IPT may also be effective in reducing the risk of relapse.​[[21]](#ParikhSVQuiltyLCRavitzPEtAl.Canadia-AC100163)​[[92]](#BocktingCLHKleinNSElgersmaHJEtAl.Ef-3F61F050)

### Treatment-Resistant Depression

The current concept of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) emphasizes failure to respond after 2 or more treatments of adequate dose and duration, assuming that medications were prescribed at optimal doses and for adequate duration prior to diagnosis.​[[93]](#RybakYELaiKSPRamasubbuREtAl.Treatme-98498A01) However, the definition may vary according to the planned intervention, e.g., the definition of TRD for an individual to receive CBT for TRD may be set at a lower threshold than for deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, there is a proposal to change the term to *difficult-to-treat depression*, as TRD may imply a resistance by the patient.​[[94]](#McAllister-WilliamsRHArangoCBlierPE-B6267A76)

Antidepressants can be *switched* either within a medication class or to a different class. Most physicians switch out of class, e.g., from SSRI to SNRI or TCA, when there has been no response to the first drug. Consider switching within a class in the presence of a favourable clinical response hampered by persistent, unmanageable side effects. For more information on switching between antidepressants see [Table 5](#table-113633-7CA1F805).

**Table 5:** Switching Antidepressants

| Switching From | Switching To | Generally Recommended Washout Period​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Most antidepressants | Most antidepressants | Generally there is no need for a washout period; a crossover technique can be applied whereby the dose of the first agent is tapered while the dose of the new antidepressant is gradually increased. Clomipramine is generally not recommended in cross-tapers; other exceptions are listed below. For specific cross-tapering instructions, consult specialized resources such as SwitchRx.ca . |
| Any other antidepressant | Irreversible MAOI or moclobemide | 5 half-lives of first antidepressant (3 wk for clomipramine and imipramine) |
| Irreversible MAOI | Any other antidepressant | 2 wk (3 wk for clomipramine or imipramine) |
| Moclobemide | Any other antidepressant | 5 days |
| Fluoxetine | Irreversible MAOI or moclobemide | 5–6 wk |
| Fluoxetine | Any other antidepressant | Use caution after fluoxetine discontinuation due to its long half-life. A washout period is often recommended, depending on the new agent. |
| Abbreviations: MAOI monoamine oxidase inhibitor |

[a] Recommendations are for general guidance only. For instructions specific to a patient scenario, consult specialized references such as [SwitchRx.ca](https://switchrx.ca/).

*Augmentation* or combination therapy is recommended when a patient tolerates the first antidepressant but has only a partial response.​[[38]](#KennedySHLamRWMcIntyreEtAl.Canadian-A6823994) Furthermore, for moderate-severe depression, or refractory depression, combination therapy should be strongly considered, particularly in individuals with a history of more than 3 previous depressive episodes.​[[95]](#c0005n00185) Two meta-analyses involving 48 and 65 trials, respectively, supported augmentation for treatment-resistant depression; options include atypical antipsychotics (specifically aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, brexpiprazole and cariprazine), liothyronine, nortriptyline, lithium, modafinil and lisdexamfetamine).​[[96]](#ZhouXRavindranAVQinBEtAl.Comparativ-AAA442D9)​[[97]](#NunezNAJosephBPahwaMEtAl.Augmentati-9891BB2E) Antipsychotic augmentation is not recommended for long-term use, and close monitoring for movement disorders, weight gain and cardiometabolic effects is indicated. There is some evidence for increased mortality risk in non-elderly patients who receive augmentation with atypical antipsychotics.​[[98]](#GerhardTStroupTSCorrellCUEtAl.Morta-98928651)

The combination of bupropion with SSRIs is also an option.​[[99]](#c0005n00053)​[[100]](#c0005n00184)

There is considerable interest in using intravenous ketamine or intranasal esketamine, NMDA receptor antagonists, as rapidly acting interventions for treatment-resistant depression.​[[101]](#PhillipsJLNorrisSTalbotJEtAl.Single-41E6C47C) This represents a new avenue of therapeutic exploration, highlighting the relevance of the glutamatergic system to TRD.

Intranasal esketamine is approved in Canada for the treatment of TRD in combination with an SSRI or SNRI.​[[102]](#PopovaVDalyEJTrivediMEtAl.EfficacyA-30F6A70F) It is available only through a controlled distribution program to ensure that all involved parties are trained on proper administration and monitoring.

Most evidence supports the efficacy of ketamine as a rapid-acting intervention.​[[87]](#SwainsonJMcGirrABlierPEtAl.TheCanad-98935628) To date, most reports have been limited to short-term therapy, and the duration of therapy remains unclear. In 2021, CANMAT recommended a one-time dose of ketamine as a third-line option for TRD.​[[87]](#SwainsonJMcGirrABlierPEtAl.TheCanad-98935628) While most ketamine clinics are not covered by health insurance, a few hospital-based centres do provide ketamine infusion treatment at no cost to the patient.

Among nonpharmacologic options, there is evidence to support adjunctive **CBT** in treatment-resistant depression.​[[103]](#WilesNThomasLAbelAEtAl.CognitiveBeh-41E932D9) Neurostimulation therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used in the management of treatment-resistant depression;​[[37]](#MilevRVGiacobbePKennedySHEtAl.Canad-AC0F80D0) however, a discussion about their use is beyond the scope of this chapter.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Depression during Pregnancy

During pregnancy, symptoms of depression are common and can be challenging to disentangle from symptoms frequently reported during pregnancy (fatigue, sleeplessness, appetite changes). Perinatal depression is one of the most common complications of pregnancy​[[104]](#GavinNIGaynesBNLohrKNEtAl.Perinatal-2DCF69E7) and is a risk factor for suicide and infanticide.​[[105]](#GrigoriadisSWiltonASKurdyakPAEtAl.P-2DCF83B5)​[[106]](#KauppiAKumpulainenKVanamoTEtAl.Mate-41E99317) Pregnant patients with a history of depression or with current depressive symptoms should receive preventative interventions such as counselling.​[[107]](#USPreventiveServicesTaskForceCurryS-2DCF9F58)

The decision to initiate or continue antidepressant treatment during pregnancy should be based on a risk-benefit analysis that considers both the fetus and the pregnant patient. Untreated depression in pregnant patients is associated with untoward effects for the fetus/neonate, patient and others.​[[108]](#c0005n00274)​[[109]](#c0005n01063)​[[110]](#c0005n01064)​[[111]](#HuRLiYZhangZEtAl.AntenatalDepressiv-AAA64C22)​[[112]](#PaulsonJFBazemoreSD.PrenatalAndPost-41EA32D3) If untreated, symptoms of depression may continue into the postpartum period or reoccur as postpartum depression.​[[113]](#FisherSDWisnerKLClarkCTEtAl.Factors-2DCDA335)​[[114]](#GaillardALeStratYMandelbrotLEtAl.Pr-2DCDC80B)

Patients with a history of severe or recurrent depression who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy may be at increased risk of relapse.​[[115]](#BaryampourHKapoorABunkaMEtAl.TheRis-98C3F040) Discontinuing antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk of exacerbated anxiety and psychiatric emergency during the perinatal period.​[[116]](#CabaillotABoursetAMulliezAEtAl.Traj-98C4621E)​[[117]](#LiuXMolenaarNAgerboEEtAl.Antidepres-B63149D1)

### Management

If symptoms are mild or if criteria for a mild-moderate depressive episode are met, psychotherapy (such as IPT and CBT) is the first treatment option.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7)​[[118]](#JohansenSLRoabkisTKWilliamsKEEtAl.M-7CA704FC) For moderate-severe episodes, antidepressant medication should be considered first line, especially in patients with a past history of depression.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7)​[[119]](#KimmelMCCoxESchillerCEtAl.Pharmacol-41EB143C) Although a dose-dependent relationship has not been elucidated, if antidepressants are prescribed during pregnancy, use the lowest effective dose. As this area is actively evolving, clinicians are advised to consult a drug information service for the most up-to-date information (e.g., [MotherToBaby.org](https://mothertobaby.org)).

### Risks of Antidepressants During Pregnancy

Evidence suggests that SSRIs are not major teratogens. Although a statistical association may exist between cardiovascular malformations (e.g., septal defects) and fetal exposure to SSRIs, recent studies controlling for confounding factors do not support this association.​[[120]](#c0005n01066)​[[121]](#HuybrechtsKEPalmstenKAvornJEtAl.Ant-2DD4F202)​[[122]](#FuruKKielerHHaglundBEtAl.SelectiveS-2DD51120) SSRI exposure late in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.​[[123]](#c0005n01045)​[[124]](#c0005n01068)​[[125]](#c0005n01101) Paroxetine and fluoxetine may have higher associated risks than other SSRIs; see [Pharmacologic Choices During Pregnancy](#topic-114245-2DD84D46).

Poor neonatal adaptation syndrome is typically transient neonatal withdrawal and/or toxicity after exposure to antidepressants in utero. Signs and symptoms include tremors, shaking, irritability, increased muscle tone, sleeping disturbances and respiratory distress; more severe symptoms have also been reported.​[[126]](#c0005n01069)​[[127]](#c0005n01070) Although reports of incidence vary from 5–85%, likely due to lack of a standardized definition, up to about 30% is typical.​[[128]](#Levinson-CastielRMerlobPLinderNEtAl-41ED5F88)

Adverse delivery outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight) have also been statistically associated with antenatal antidepressant use, although the clinical relevance is not certain.​[[129]](#c0005n01067)​[[130]](#EkeACSacconeGBerghellaV.SelectiveSe-2DD6281E)​[[131]](#HuangHColemanSBridgeJAEtAl.AMeta-an-2DD62ADD)

The relationships between perinatal exposure to antidepressants and incidence of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have been the topic of great debate; however, the evidence is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions. Studies examining the effect of antidepressant exposure on growth and development of brain, language, and cognition also have inconsistent findings that are confounded by maternal psychopathology.​[[132]](#SuarezEABatemanBTHernandez-DiazSEtA) The Canadian Paediatric Society 2021 position statement summarizes the evidence and concludes that overall “...the risk of serious adverse effects from exposure to SSRIs or SNRIs in utero is low.”​[[133]](#HendsonLShahVTrkuljaS.SelectiveSero-98C68034)

With regards to risks to the pregnant patient, antidepressants have been associated with maternal hypertension/pre-eclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, and caesarean section.​[[134]](#GadotYKorenG.TheUseOfAntidepressant-98D609B9)​[[135]](#JianHXuLLiYEtAl.AntidepressantUseDu-98D6ACB0) Studies, however, have not been consistent in their findings.​[[136]](#BruningAHellerHKievietNEtAl.Antidep-98D6C6F6)

### Pharmacologic Choices During Pregnancy

If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, **citalopram**, **escitalopram** and **sertraline** are first-line options.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7) Fluoxetine is a second-line option since its association with major malformations is more controversial.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7)​[[120]](#c0005n01066) Paroxetine has been associated with risk for major malformations, and although the clinical magnitude is questionable, it is still not recommended for perinatal depression, unless the patient was stable on it prior to conception.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7)​[[137]](#BerardAIessaNChaabaneSEtAl.TheRiskO-2DDBFAB1)​[[138]](#BerardAZhaoJPSheehyO.Antidepressant-2DDC1DB4)

Second-line options in the treatment of perinatal depression include bupropion, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline) and venlafaxine.​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7) MAOIs and doxepin should be avoided during pregnancy. Clomipramine should be considered only if the patient was stabilized on it prior to conception. Other antidepressants have not been studied sufficiently in pregnancy to make recommendations on their use (e.g., trazodone, vilazodone, vortioxetine, levomilnacipran).

### Postpartum Mood Disturbances

Postpartum mood disturbances is a term that encompasses the following 3 presentations: postpartum “blues,” which affect up to 80% of patients after a pregnancy,​[[139]](#c0005n01071) postpartum major depression, which occurs in up to 16% of patients in Canada after a pregnancy and postpartum psychosis, which occurs in ≤0.1%.​[[140]](#c0005n00294)​[[141]](#c0005n00275)​[[142]](#c0005n01072)

The blues are not a disorder per se, given that they are so common and symptoms are self-limiting, requiring only monitoring and supportive care. However, patients with postpartum blues are at risk of developing a depressive episode.

### Management

Psychotherapy, preferably IPT or CBT, should be considered first for the treatment of postpartum depression, particularly if the patient is breastfeeding. When the illness is more severe, psychotherapy may be inadequate or inappropriate, in which case antidepressant treatment should be initiated. For breastfeeding patients, the 2016 CANMAT guidelines on MDD recommend consideration of sertraline, escitalopram or citalopram as first-line pharmacologic options;​[[11]](#MacQueenGMFreyBNJaworskaNEtAl.Canad-A67FDDE7) this recommendation remains current. Second-line options include fluoxetine, paroxetine and nortriptyline. Other antidepressants lack sufficient data in breastfeeding patients. Doxepin is not recommended due to documented significant adverse effects in the breastfed infant. Brexanolone, a novel agent requiring an extended infusion, has been approved by the FDA for the management of postpartum depression; it is not available in Canada.​[[143]](#Meltzer-BrodySColguhounHRiesenbergR-41EEDEE9)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Prescribers should choose 1 or 2 agents from several antidepressant classes and use them consistently to acquire expertise in the use of those medications.
- Individualize therapy by considering patient comorbidities and most significant symptoms of depression (e.g., sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, somatic symptoms); see the [Antidepressant Decision Support Tool](https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/68/11/807/F1.large.jpg) developed in 2022 to help guide selection.
- Before prescribing an antidepressant, discuss side effect profiles, drug-drug interactions and discontinuation-emergent side effects with the patient.
- Provide key psychoeducational messages (as noted in [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0005n00006)) with the initial prescription. Reinforce and add to this during regular follow-up visits.
- A combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (specifically IPT or CBT) is superior to either modality alone. In mild to moderate cases, combination therapy provides little synergy compared to either treatment alone, but does provide protection against early relapse compared to either treatment alone. Pharmacotherapy typically facilitates more rapid relief of symptoms, but does not prevent relapse if the medication is stopped; both IPT and CBT reduce relapse for up to 3 years after completion of a course of psychotherapy.
- Reinforce the importance of maintenance therapy beyond the acute phase.
- There is a limited role for therapeutic drug-level monitoring as there is a poor correlation between serum levels of SSRI or SNRI antidepressants and clinical response or side effects. Similarly, there is only a limited benefit in performing pharmacogenetic testing for cytochrome P450 enzyme polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetic testing is, however, warranted in cases such as a failure to respond to high doses of several antidepressants (which may suggest that the patient is an ultra-rapid metabolizer) or repeated inability to tolerate low doses of several agents (which may suggest a poor metabolizer status).
- In nonresponders, review alcohol and drug abuse history, assess medication adherence and confirm diagnosis.
- Refer for psychiatric consultation if the patient has psychotic symptoms or acute suicidal ideation, or after failure of 3 treatment trials.
- When discontinuing antidepressants, taper slowly over 4–6 weeks. This is particularly important for paroxetine and venlafaxine.
