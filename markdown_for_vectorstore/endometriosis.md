### Introduction

Endometriosis is defined by the presence of tissue that resembles endometrium at sites outside the uterine cavity. It is a chronic, debilitating condition causing recurrent pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility. Diagnosis requires histological confirmation of at least 2 of the following: endometrial epithelium, endometrial glands, endometrial stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Although endometriosis is most often classified according to the 4 stages of the revised American Fertility Sterility Classification (minimal, mild, moderate and severe),​[[1]](#c0075n00040) there is no direct correlation between the volume of endometriotic tissue (i.e., stage of disease) and either pregnancy rates or severity of symptoms. Ovaries and the cul-de-sac (rectouterine pouch) are the most common sites of endometriotic tissue growth (endometriotic implants). Endometriosis of the ovaries commonly presents as pelvic masses composed of cyst-like structures (endometriomas) that contain blood, fluid and menstrual debris.

Endometriosis affects 10–15% of women in their reproductive years. There is a higher incidence of endometriosis in Caucasian women and in women with an early age of menarche, short menstrual cycle length, low BMI and tall height.​[[2]](#c0075n00386) Alcohol and caffeine use may increase risk but the association is not clear. Factors that may decrease risk of endometriosis include parity, current contraceptive use, smoking, high BMI, regular exercise and omega 3-fatty acid consumption.​[[2]](#c0075n00386)

Endometriosis may be treated with drugs, surgery or both. Treatment may be individualized according to age, duration of infertility, severity of pelvic pain, response to previous therapies, anticipated side effects and cost. This chapter discusses the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain and infertility.

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve pain
- Treat infertility
- Prevent recurrence

### Investigations

Diagnosis of endometriosis is difficult due to its variable clinical presentation. Significant overlap with other conditions, e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, has been observed.​[[3]](#c0075n00037)

- History of pelvic pain (cyclical at first, becomes continuous as endometriosis worsens), dysmenorrhea (does not diminish after menstrual day 2), deep dyspareunia or infertility suggests endometriosis
- Physical examination: a pelvic examination with tenderness, particularly in the uterosacral ligament area and especially around the time of menses, suggests endometriosis
- Objective measurements:

  - The gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis is laparoscopy ± biopsy. Appearance of endometriotic tissue may be typical or atypical. Focal deposits may have the classic blue or black appearance. They may also appear yellow, brown, white or red—81% of such areas show histological evidence of endometriosis.​[[4]](#c0075n00038)
  - There are no blood tests available that can reliably diagnose endometriosis.​[[5]](#refitem-119217-1BD4CC5E) Serum CA 125 (a tumor-associated protein) levels are often significantly elevated (>35 units/mL) but not always found with endometriosis.​[[6]](#refitem-119218-34A37105) Other causes of elevated serum CA 125 levels include pelvic inflammatory disease, epithelial ovarian cancer and pregnancy. Serum CA 125 levels should not be performed as part of routine diagnostic work-up but are useful for treatment follow-up and may aid in identifying infertile women with severe endometriosis who could benefit from surgery.​[[7]](#c0075n00039)
  - Ultrasound reliably identifies masses with features of endometriomas;​[[8]](#c0075n00041) however, these features are nonspecific. The use of colour velocity imaging and pulsed Doppler does not improve the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography alone in the diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma.​[[9]](#c0075n00387) Sensitivity of ultrasound is poor for the detection of focal implants.​[[10]](#c0075n00042)
  - MRI may be useful for identifying deep subperitoneal lesions and for monitoring residual or recurrent disease after surgery.

### Endometriosis-Associated Pain

### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of endometriosis is shown in [Figure 1](#c0075n00065).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The primary goals in the surgical treatment of endometriosis-associated pain include the removal of typical and atypical endometriotic implants and the restoration of pelvic anatomy. After any form of surgery, residual disease may be left behind. Surgical approaches are listed in [Table 1](#c0075n00014).

*Conservative surgery* is a cytoreductive procedure that involves ablation or excision, i.e., destruction or removal of extra-uterine endometrial tissue respectively, and is not necessarily curative. It may be considered for recurrent disease, if pain relief is required, or if a patient declines definitive surgical therapy. After ablative surgery, 60–100% of patients experience decreased severity of pain.​[[11]](#c0075n00045) Recurrence rates range from 13.5–40.3% at 5 years.​[[12]](#c0075n00046) Pregnancy does not influence the average time to recurrence of symptoms.​[[13]](#c0075n00253)

Conservative surgery can be performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy; both procedures are equally effective.​[[14]](#c0075n00047) Potential advantages of laparoscopy over open surgery include the ability to treat the disease at the time of diagnosis, enhanced removal and ablation of endometriosis, reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay, rapid recovery and potential decrease in the rate of postoperative adhesion formation.​[[15]](#c0075n00048)

One randomized controlled trial with follow-up showed that laser ablation with laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) effectively relieved pain in 62.5% of treated patients compared to 22.6% in the control group (no treatment).​[[16]](#c0075n00049)​[[17]](#c0075n00333) However, a later Cochrane review concluded that the addition of LUNA to surgical treatment for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea (including endometriosis) did not aid pain relief.​[[18]](#c0075n00358) Current guidelines suggest that LUNA alone does not provide significant pain relief in patients with endometriosis.​[[19]](#c0075n00356)

*Presacral neurectomy*, in conjunction with conservative surgery for endometriosis, may be effective in relieving severe midline dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis if the surgeon completely resects the presacral nerve plexus.​[[20]](#c0075n00050) Results of adding this procedure to conservative surgery are mixed.

Following surgical ablation/resection of endometriosis, the risk of recurrence of pain is estimated to be as high as 40% at 10 years of follow-up.​[[21]](#c0075n00273) Pain relief may be maximized and relapse/symptom recurrence may be reduced by long-term hormonal contraceptive therapy​[[22]](#c0075n00350)​[[23]](#c0075n00351) (see [Hormonal Therapies](#c0075n00236)). There is limited but consistent evidence showing that postoperative LNG-IUS reduces the recurrence of painful periods in women with endometriosis; further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.​[[24]](#c0075n00388) As conservative surgery is considered to be cytoreductive in more advanced disease, it is reasonable to use surgery to “reduce” this stage of the disease before initiating drug treatment. Once drug treatment is discontinued, symptoms may recur.

**Table 1:** Surgical Management of Endometriosis-Associated Infertility or Pain

| Surgical Approach | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Conservative surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) | Used in endometriosis-associated pain and infertility Laparoscopy offers advantage of ability to treat at time of diagnosis, reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain and quicker convalescence, but requires surgical expertise and expensive equipment Cytoreductive procedure that is not necessarily curative Two-thirds of patients treated with surgery have pain relief for at least 1 year |
| Presacral neurectomy (PSN) | Involves resection of the presacral nerve plexus. Used in conjunction with conservative surgery for relieving severe midline dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis |
| Hysterectomy | Limited to treatment-resistant endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea in women with endometriosis confined to the uterus, if childbearing complete Major indication is intractable pain that has not responded to more conservative measures |
| Hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy | May be offered as definitive therapy for treatment-resistant endometriosis-associated pelvic pain or adnexal masses in women with extensive extra-uterine disease |

*Definitive surgical therapy* of endometriosis-associated pain requires total abdominal hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with complete excision or ablation of endometriosis. The major indication for definitive therapy is intractable pain in patients who have not responded to more conservative measures or who have completed their families. It is considered 90–95% effective for pain relief.​[[25]](#c0075n00043)

A retrospective study of recurrence of symptoms after definitive surgery with a mean follow up of 4 years and 10 months showed that 62% of patients with ovarian conservation had recurrent symptoms and 31% required further surgery. In women with bilateral oophorectomy, 10% had recurrent symptoms and 3.7% required further surgery.​[[26]](#c0075n00254) Postoperative **estrogen** replacement therapy is associated with minimal (1–3%) risk of disease recurrence.​[[27]](#c0075n00044)​[[28]](#c0075n00389) There is no advantage in delaying the introduction of estrogen replacement therapy after surgery.​[[26]](#c0075n00254)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Additional information on drug therapy for the management of endometriosis-associated pain can be found in [Table 2](#c0075n00150).

### Analgesics

NSAIDs inhibit endometrial prostaglandins (which cause abnormal uterine contractions). The efficacy of NSAIDs for managing pain caused by endometriosis, rather than dysmenorrhea, has not been sufficiently studied.​[[29]](#c0075n00052) However, it is often assumed that they are as effective in the management of endometriosis-associated pain as in the management of dysmenorrhea, and are therefore recommended as first-line treatment of mild endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea (see Dysmenorrhea). NSAIDs can be used as an adjunct to combined oral contraceptives, progestin-only contraceptives, GnRH agonists or danazol, if needed.​[[30]](#c0075n00390) They are most effective if started at the onset of menstrual symptoms and given throughout the menstrual period. NSAIDs are well tolerated, safe and inexpensive.​[[29]](#c0075n00052) There is no evidence one NSAID is more effective than another.

**Opioid analgesics** may be used but their effect on bowel motility may contribute to pelvic pain. Although long-term use may lead to addiction, opioids may be appropriate in select patients with intractable chronic pain and no history of drug abuse (for a listing of opioids, see Low Back Pain). Avoid opioids with short half-lives, as they are associated with rebound pain; consider long-acting opioids only in specific situations involving severe, unrelenting pain. For more information on prescribing opioids for patients with non-cancer chronic pain according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines, consult the [Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Tool](https://cep.health/clinical-products/opioid-use-disorder/).

Although there have been studies on the use of cannabis in endometriosis, particularly the endocannabinoid ligand N-palmitoylethanolamine, most of the clinical studies were of small sample size; there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use.​[[31]](#refitem-1212131-803F93B5)

Consider prescribing analgesics if necessary for pain relief while awaiting resolution of symptoms from other treatments (both medical and surgical).​[[19]](#c0075n00356) Opioids may be considered if NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective.

### Hormonal Therapies

### Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

**Combined oral** contraceptives **(COCs)** relieve symptoms in 75–100% of cases of endometriosis-associated pain, reduce menstrual blood flow and suppress ovulation. When used continuously, monophasic COCs produce amenorrhea,​[[29]](#c0075n00052)​[[32]](#c0075n00053) and pain (associated with estrogen and progestin withdrawal) may be suppressed.​[[29]](#c0075n00052)​[[32]](#c0075n00053)​[[33]](#c0075n00334) Low-dose COCs can be used for an unlimited time.

The **contraceptive vaginal ring** and **transdermal contraceptives** may also help in symptomatic endometriosis.​[[34]](#c0075n00391) However, both systems are associated with irregular bleeding when used continuously. The transdermal patch will help with pain, but the contraceptive ring is more effective in reducing pain in women with rectovaginal endometriotic lesions. The patch is associated with more dysmenorrhea compared to oral contraceptives.​[[35]](#refitem-1192136-1BDE028C)

### Progestin-Only Contraceptives

When used continuously, progestin**s** inhibit ovulation and suppress gonadotropin secretion thereby inducing a hypoestrogenic, acyclic hormonal environment.

Injectable depot medroxyprogesterone **acetate (MPA)**, 150 mg every 6–12 weeks intramuscularly, significantly reduces pain and induces amenorrhea.​[[36]](#c0075n00056)​[[37]](#c0075n00335) Do not use depot MPA in younger women who wish to become pregnant immediately after stopping treatment because resumption of ovulation is delayed following cessation of therapy. Depot MPA may decrease bone mineral density;​[[38]](#c0075n00275)​[[39]](#c0075n00276)​[[40]](#c0075n00277) reserve use for patients >18 years who do not want to conceive and who wish to avoid surgery. Continuous oral MPA 20–40 mg daily, norethindrone 5–15 mg daily or dienogest 2 mg daily relieve endometriosis-associated pain.​[[41]](#c0075n00374)​[[42]](#c0075n00392) Ovulation resumes promptly after discontinuation of oral therapy. High-dose progestin therapy may cause spotting/irregular bleeding, weight gain and mood changes, e.g., depression.

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system **(LNG-IUS)** delivers the drug directly into the uterine cavity at a steady rate of 20 mcg/day over a 5-year period. An effective hormonal option for the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis (mild to moderate disease), LNG-IUS alters the staging of disease​[[43]](#c0075n00063) and has been effective in symptom control for up to 3 years.​[[44]](#c0075n00057)​[[45]](#c0075n00357) Advantages include lower cost, no repeated treatments and fewer side effects. Breakthrough bleeding is common especially in the first 3 months. Amenorrhea occurs in up to 35% of patients at 1 year. There is a lack of data evaluating the use of low-dose (<20 mcg/day) levonorgestrel intrauterine systems for endometriosis.

### Androgen Agonists

Danazol inhibits ovarian estrogen production and causes atrophy of endometrial deposits. It is highly effective in the treatment of endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea but less effective in the management of chronic pelvic pain.​[[46]](#c0075n00278) Endometriomas >1 cm in diameter respond poorly to danazol. Doses of 600–800 mg/day for 6 months effectively alleviate symptoms of endometriosis, particularly in the earlier stages of the disease.​[[47]](#c0075n00059) Although effective, its use is limited by its adverse effect profile: androgenic side effects (e.g., hirsutism and acne) and a negative impact on lipids are common with danazol therapy.​[[48]](#c0075n00393)

### Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists

**Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists** inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, reducing the secretion of LH and FSH required for follicular development. The result is a markedly hypoestrogenic state, which induces atrophy and regression of endometriotic implants.​[[49]](#c0075n00060) GnRH agonists are as effective as COCs​[[50]](#c0075n00355) and progestins​[[37]](#c0075n00335)​[[51]](#c0075n00395) in managing endometriosis-associated pain. Because low-dose COC therapy can be unlimited in duration and is associated with fewer adverse effects,​[[50]](#c0075n00355) it is reasonable to consider GnRH agonist therapy only when low-dose COC therapy is ineffective or contraindicated.​[[19]](#c0075n00356)

GnRH agonists available in Canada are listed in [Table 2](#c0075n00150); there is no advantage of one GnRH agonist over another. A 3-month course of GnRH agonist therapy is adequate as no significant differences in pain relief or clinical symptoms were observed in a trial of 3 months versus 6 months of therapy.​[[52]](#c0075n00061) Hypoestrogenic adverse effects are common and include hot flashes, insomnia, mood changes and vaginal atrophy. A decrease in bone mineral density of 1–3% is seen when a GnRH agonist is taken for 3–6 months.​[[53]](#c0075n00279) Recurrence of endometriosis symptoms commonly occurs within 9–12 months after completion of therapy. After treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, the rate of recurrent pelvic pain over 5 years ranges from 37% in patients with mild endometriosis to 74% in those with severe disease.​[[54]](#c0075n00272)

"Add-back" **hormone therapy (HT)** is used to mitigate the perimenopausal-type symptoms and bone density loss that occur with GnRH agonists. There is no standard add-back therapy regimen, although generally it consists of estrogen or progesterone alone or in combination.​[[55]](#refitem-1212155-6A2563B1) Canadian guidelines suggest any standard HT regimen containing estradiol-17-beta 1 mg or equivalent plus a progestin, e.g., medroxyprogesterone **acetate (MPA)**, would be adequate.​[[19]](#c0075n00356)​[[56]](#c0075n00062) Norethindrone **acetate** 5 mg once daily is an alternative to MPA either with an estrogen or alone; both regimens are effective for maintaining BMD in the lumbar spine.​[[55]](#refitem-1212155-6A2563B1)​[[57]](#c0075n00281) Theoretically, other formulations of progesterone may be used but have not been studied for add-back therapy, e.g., micronized progesterone.

A GnRH agonist plus add-back hormone therapy is as effective as GnRH agonist therapy alone for relieving pelvic symptoms in endometriosis.​[[58]](#c0075n00280) Add-back hormone therapy provides a serum concentration of estrogen low enough that it does not increase the recurrence rate of endometriosis. Efficacy of GnRH agonist treatment is not reduced, and adverse hypoestrogenic effects are decreased although not abolished.​[[59]](#c0075n00285) GnRH agonists plus add-back hormone therapy may be used for 6–12 months.​[[57]](#c0075n00281) The risks of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease associated with hormone therapy are low given this relatively short-term use in young women. However, add-back hormones should not be used in women with risk factors for thromboembolic disease.

### Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists

Elagolix is a nonprotein GnRH antagonist that reduces endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pain in a dose of 150 mg/day or 200 mg BID for 3–6 months.​[[60]](#Taylor2017) It may also reduce endometriosis-associated dyspareunia.​[[60]](#Taylor2017) Consistent with the mechanism of action, elagolix treatment results in hypoestrogenic side effects, including hot flashes, and changes in bone mineral density and lipid levels. While both doses were found to be effective, the higher twice-daily dose was associated with higher rates of adverse effects.​[[61]](#Lamb2018) It is therefore reasonable to reserve the higher twice daily dose for more severe refractory cases.

### Others

Patients with endometriosis have a high level of aromatase P450 expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium. Aromatase P450 inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) reduce estrogen produced from sources other than the ovary such as the adrenal gland. Aromatase inhibitors are used with oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists or a progestin to reduce the risk of developing ovarian cysts.​[[62]](#c0075n00242) Aromatase inhibitors represent a promising new approach to the therapy for endometriosis pain, but further research is required.​[[19]](#c0075n00356)​[[62]](#c0075n00242)​[[63]](#c0075n00243)​[[64]](#c0075n00244)​[[65]](#c0075n00336)​[[66]](#c0075n00283)

Selective progesterone receptor modulators such as **mifepristone (RU-486)** and ulipristal may play a role in the treatment of endometriosis. In a 2017 meta-analysis, mifepristone was shown to provide relief of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia due to endometriosis after 3 months of treatment. However, mifepristone is not available in Canada, except as a combination product with misoprostol for the termination of a pregnancy. Ulipristal has been voluntarily removed from the Canadian market due to risk of serious liver injury requiring liver transplant.​[[67]](#HCrecallUPA)

### Recurrent Disease

Combined oral contraceptives reduce symptoms of mild disease (suggested by pelvic tenderness, no nodularity) and may be used for an unlimited time. The use of continuous regimens is preferable to cyclic regimens, particularly after conservative surgery.​[[68]](#refitem-1192167-1BDF5F35) Use MPA, danazol or a GnRH agonist if low-dose COC therapy is ineffective.

MPA, danazol or a GnRH agonist may also be used to relieve the pain of advanced disease (suggested by an adnexal mass, a fixed uterus or obliteration of the cul-de-sac) but may not affect the disease process. Although these drugs may reduce the size of endometriomas, their use does not necessarily reduce the length of surgery or affect its eventual outcome.

Use danazol or a progestin as alternative treatment when there has been marked unrecovered bone loss with GnRH agonist therapy, when bone mineral density is not being evaluated or if the patient has other risk factors for osteoporosis.

### Endometriosis-Associated Infertility

### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of endometriosis is shown in [Figure 1](#c0075n00065).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Surgery

Additional information on surgical procedures for the management of endometriosis can be found in [Table 1](#c0075n00014).

Drug treatment of endometriosis does not improve fecundity.​[[69]](#c0075n00249) Laparoscopy and laparotomy are equally successful in the surgical treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility.​[[14]](#c0075n00047)​[[70]](#c0075n00246) Laparoscopy offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, less pain and quicker convalescence but requires surgical expertise and expensive equipment.

Laparoscopic resection or ablation of minimal or mild endometriosis enhances fecundity in infertile women.​[[25]](#c0075n00043) For women desiring pregnancy, excision is preferable to ablation as spontaneous pregnancy rates are higher 9–12 months after surgery.​[[71]](#refitem-1192127-373D2B6A)

The addition of postsurgical GnRH agonist therapy offers no advantage over surgery alone in terms of pain relief or increased fertility.​[[27]](#c0075n00044)

### Assisted Reproductive Technologies

The efficacy of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in treating endometriosis-associated infertility has not been evaluated based on severity of disease or other important prognostic variables such as age and duration of infertility. With improvements in IVF programs, this therapy may be considered in milder forms of endometriosis-associated infertility.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of endometriosis-associated infertility are presented in [Table 3](#c0075n10340).

### Ovulation Induction

While used for many years in the management of fertility disorders, production of clomiphene was discontinued in Canada in 2017. Letrozole is an effective off-label option that can be used as an ovulation-inducing agent.​[[72]](#refitem-11921681-1B6943D1) Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen; reduced estrogen levels stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete FSH resulting in ovarian follicle recruitment. Letrozole 2.5 mg daily administered for days 3–7 of the cycle will induce ovulation. Success rates for ovulation induction and pregnancy rates are similar to clomiphene. Letrozole is not associated with increased birth defects and is well tolerated. The main side effects are fatigue and dizziness. Human chorionic gonadotropin **(hCG)** is sometimes added in a dose of 5000–10 000 units IM at midcycle, with or without intrauterine insemination.

A Cochrane review concluded that administering GnRH agonists for 3–6 months prior to IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection in women with endometriosis results in a 4-fold increase in the odds of clinical pregnancy.​[[73]](#c0075n00284) Use gonadotropin therapy, referred to as superovulation or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, together with intrauterine insemination to treat minimal or mild endometriosis-associated infertility.​[[74]](#c0075n00248) Live birth rates diminish with successive treatments. Because of its cost, limit gonadotropin therapy to 3 cycles.

As fecundity significantly decreases and the spontaneous abortion rate increases in women >35 years of age, these patients may benefit from an aggressive therapeutic plan with superovulation/intrauterine insemination or IVF-ET.​[[69]](#c0075n00249)

### Ovarian Suppression

Ovarian suppression is inappropriate to use for endometriosis-associated infertility as it prevents pregnancy. It may be an option if there is severe coexisting endometriosis-associated pain.​[[75]](#c0075n00250)​[[76]](#c0075n00397)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Women with endometriosis may have difficulty conceiving, but in women who become pregnant, symptoms of endometriosis are suppressed and thus treatment is not required; however, the disease may recur after childbirth.

During breastfeeding, symptoms may remain in remission, at least initially; treatment is not required as long as breastfeeding is frequent and intense enough to inhibit estrogen release from the ovaries. While prolonged breastfeeding and multiple pregnancies protect against the development of endometriosis,​[[78]](#c0075n00337) symptoms may recur during long-term breastfeeding.

. . . . .

### Therapeutic Tips

- Chronic pelvic pain is a diagnosis in itself and should be treated. If pain is not thought to be due to primary dysmenorrhea, consider it endometriosis unless proven otherwise.​[[19]](#c0075n00356)
- Hormonal treatment may be used prior to surgery to reduce the size of endometrial implants; however, this strategy does not prolong the pain-free interval, decrease recurrence rates or increase pregnancy rates.
- After surgery (laparotomy, laparoscopic conservative or definitive surgical treatment), residual disease treated with progestin, danazol or GnRH agonist results in a prolonged pain-free interval and delayed recurrence.​[[77]](#c0075n00259)
- To promote bone health, encourage adequate calcium intake (1200 mg/day total intake, preferably through dietary intake) and vitamin D supplementation (400–1000 units/day) for women taking **GnRH agonists** with add-back **hormone therapy**.
