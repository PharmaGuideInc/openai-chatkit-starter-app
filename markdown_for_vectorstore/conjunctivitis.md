### Pathophysiology

The conjunctiva is a thin, translucent, relatively elastic tissue layer that lines the inside of the eyelids (palpebral portion) and the anterior aspect of the globe (bulbar portion) (see Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis, Figure 1). As the outermost layer of the exterior surface of the globe, the conjunctiva is exposed to many microorganisms and other environmental factors. The combined action of the tears and eyelids protects the conjunctiva by trapping and diluting debris and organisms, then flushing the tears into the nasolacrimal duct.​[[1]](#psc1015n1001)​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)

Conjunctivitis is a general term that refers to any inflammatory condition of the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the exposed surface of the sclera. The inflammation can be hyperacute, acute or chronic in presentation and may be caused by infection or many other factors (see [Table 1](#psc1015n00002)). Conjunctivitis is the most common worldwide cause of red eye.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003) This chapter addresses bacterial (hyperacute, acute and chronic), viral and allergic conjunctivitis.

Common causes of conjunctivitis are listed in [Table 1](#psc1015n00002).

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms
- Prevent complications (preserve eyesight)
- Prevent recurrence
- Cure or control infection, where present
- Prevent transmission of infection to others

### Patient Assessment

An algorithm for the assessment of eye conditions is presented in Assessment of Patients with Eye Conditions.

Typically, patients present with some degree of redness in the conjunctiva, as well as some type of discharge. Other descriptions of symptoms include a scratching or burning sensation, a foreign body sensation, a feeling of fullness around the eyes, itching, and mild photophobia. Often the eyes are crusty or sticky after sleeping, particularly with bacterial conjunctivitis.

Signs and symptoms of the most common types of conjunctivitis are listed in [Table 2](#psc1015n00007).

**Table 2:** Signs and Symptoms of Conjunctivitis

| Clinical Findings | Viral | Bacterial | Allergic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Itching | Minimal | Minimal | Severe |
| Redness | Generalized | Generalized | Generalized |
| Discharge | Profuse, serous | Moderate, mucopurulent or purulent | Moderate, serous or mucoid |

### Acute Bacterial Conjunctivitis

### Introduction

Approximately 60% of suspected and documented cases of bacterial conjunctivitis resolve spontaneously in 1–2 weeks.​[[8]](#AmirAABarneyNP.ConjunctivitisASyste-A8162FDE) Bacteria may be eradicated in 5 days with a 7-day course of antibiotics.​[[9]](#VaruDMRheeMKAkpekEKEtAl.Conjunctivi-3DD0A400) Antibiotic treatment may also decrease the risk of more serious corneal complications, recurrences and person-to-person spread.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[10]](#psc1015n1007)​[[11]](#psc1015n01037)​[[12]](#psc1015n01038)​[[13]](#psc1015n01039) The practice of delayed antibiotics (patients are given an antibiotic prescription to fill 3 days after being assessed, if needed) demonstrated 50% less antibiotic use than immediate antibiotics.​[[14]](#EverittHALIttlePSSmithPW.ARandomise-83E29985) Moderate symptoms persisted only half a day longer in the delayed group. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus, but Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are also common, especially in children.​[[1]](#psc1015n1001)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[15]](#psc1015n1006)​[[16]](#psc1015n1008)​[[17]](#psc1015n01040)

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

- The patient, family and other care providers should be careful to prevent contamination by avoiding direct hand-to-eye contact, and should employ proper handwashing techniques to avoid transmitting the infection. Separate towels should be used by patients with infections (see Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis, Infections of the Eyes or Eyelids—What You Need to Know).
- If eyelids are stuck together in the morning, soak with a warm compress and open carefully.
- The conjunctival sac can be irrigated with sterile saline or a commercial eye wash product as necessary to remove conjunctival secretions.
- Because of an increased risk of developing serious infections, advise contact lens wearers with conjunctivitis to stop using their lenses and lens cases and seek medical advice.​[[8]](#AmirAABarneyNP.ConjunctivitisASyste-A8162FDE)
- Patients who use eye drops, e.g., for glaucoma or dry eye, should replace the eye drop bottles in case the bottles have been inadvertently contaminated.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Ophthalmic Products: Anti-infectives.

For mild cases of bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, **polymyxin B/gramicidin** eye drops can be used; generally, continue treatment for 2 days after symptoms have resolved.​[[1]](#psc1015n1001)​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[10]](#psc1015n1007)​[[16]](#psc1015n1008)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)​[[19]](#psc1015n01041)

Polymyxin B-based combinations are not reliably bactericidal.​[[19]](#psc1015n01041) If there is no improvement within 48 hours of starting treatment, refer the patient to a physician or eye-care practitioner.

When the infection is moderate to severe, or if polymyxin-based products have been ineffective, the use of standard empiric treatment with broad spectrum antibacterial drops is warranted (e.g., **trimethoprim/polymyxin B** ophthalmic drops, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, fusidic acid ophthalmic drops).​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[10]](#psc1015n1007)​[[16]](#psc1015n1008)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009) Adults and adolescents generally prefer ophthalmic drops. Ointments may be better tolerated by young children, who may not be bothered by ointment-induced blurred vision and may find drop administration irritating.

Tobramycin provides good gram-negative coverage and relatively poor gram-positive coverage with systemic use but is sufficiently effective in the topical treatment of conjunctivitis. Toxicity to the corneal epithelium can occur, especially with prolonged use. Reserve fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin) for serious infections such as bacterial keratitis.​[[1]](#psc1015n1001)​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[10]](#psc1015n1007)​[[16]](#psc1015n1008)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)

For more information on ophthalmic antibacterials, see [Table 4](#conj_dt1).

. . . . .

### Hyperacute Bacterial Conjunctivitis

### Introduction

This infection is most commonly seen in neonates or sexually active young people (15–24 years of age).​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[10]](#psc1015n1007)​[[15]](#psc1015n1006)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009) It is a severe, sight-threatening ocular infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Neisseria meningitidis. It is characterized by a copious, yellow-green purulent discharge, redness, irritation and tenderness to palpation. Symptoms are rapidly progressive, leading to severe corneal damage, perforation and loss of vision if there is any delay in treatment. In adults, the organism is usually transmitted from the genitalia to the hands and then to the eyes. In infants, transmission of the organism occurs during vaginal delivery, and they typically develop bilateral discharge 3–5 days after birth. As a preventive measure, ophthalmic antibiotic ointments have been routinely applied to infants immediately after delivery; however, the Canadian Paediatric Society currently recommends abolishing the mandatory application of antibiotic ophthalmic ointment to newborns.​[[20]](#CanadianPaediatricSociety.Preventin-A88043BD) Instead, it recommends screening all pregnant women for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and subsequently treating infants with effective antibiotics if the mother has an untreated infection at time of delivery.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Immediate medical assessment is required. After treatment has been initiated, the same adjunctive nonpharmacologic measures as used for acute bacterial conjunctivitis can be implemented.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Medical assessment is imperative. Treatment consists of immediate Gram staining of specimens, followed by systemic and ophthalmic antibacterials and saline irrigation. For more information on ophthalmic antibacterials, see [Table 4](#conj_dt1).

. . . . .

### Chronic Bacterial Conjunctivitis

### Introduction

Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis is defined as a condition that lasts 4 weeks or longer. It is often associated with blepharitis, and is sometimes found in conjunction with facial seborrhea, acne rosacea, nasolacrimal duct obstruction or chronic dacryocystitis. S. aureus and Moraxella lacunata are most commonly involved, the latter occurring in clusters in women who share contaminated makeup.​[[4]](#psc1015n1004)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)

In sexually active adults, chronic bacterial conjunctivitis can be a manifestation of a sexually transmitted infection involving Chlamydia trachomatis.​[[6]](#PetrovayFNemethIBalazsAEtAl.Chlamyd-BC339E13)

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Treatment is similar to the treatment of blepharitis (see Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis). Eyelid hygiene and warm compresses are important as a daily routine. Contaminated facial-care products and makeup should be discarded.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis has a protracted course with periods of exacerbation, and treatment should be carefully managed by an appropriate health-care practitioner.

Topical antibacterials are used during periods of exacerbation. Patients whose chronic conjunctivitis is associated with meibomian gland dysfunction or severe acne rosacea may benefit from oral agents such as doxycycline or erythromycin;​[[21]](#BernardesTFBonfioliAA.Blepharitis.S-BA01B844) for more information, see Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis. Topical metronidazole therapy for acne rosacea may also ameliorate associated conjunctivitis; for more information consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices:* Rosacea.

For more information on ophthalmic antibacterials, see [Table 4](#conj_dt1).

. . . . .

### Viral Conjunctivitis

### Introduction

Patients with viral conjunctivitis usually present with an acutely red eye, watery discharge, conjunctival swelling, foreign body sensation and mild photophobia. There may be tenderness around the preauricular node. Occasionally, patients may have subconjunctival hemorrhage.​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[22]](#psc1015n1012) Both eyes may be affected at the same time, or the second eye may become infected a few days after the first. If this happens, the infection is usually more severe in the first eye.

The most common causative organism of viral conjunctivitis is adenovirus. Viral infections are highly contagious and can be spread through respiratory tract-to-eye, finger-to-eye or instrument-to-eye (physician's office) contact as well as via contaminated swimming pools. Some patients have an associated respiratory tract infection.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[15]](#psc1015n1006)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)​[[22]](#psc1015n1012) The incubation period ranges from 2–14 days and the infection can last from 2–4 weeks.​[[15]](#psc1015n1006) The eye remains contagious for up to 2 weeks after the second eye becomes involved.​[[5]](#psc1015n1005)​[[9]](#VaruDMRheeMKAkpekEKEtAl.Conjunctivi-3DD0A400)

*Herpes simplex* virus (HSV) and *herpes zoster* can also cause viral conjunctivitis. The risk of progressive keratitis is higher with these types of infections.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

All patients with suspected viral conjunctivitis require medical assessment to determine the cause.

Treatment of adenovirus conjunctivitis is supportive. Cold compresses may increase patient comfort.​[[23]](#psc1015n01042) Instruct patients to avoid direct contact with others for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms (in the second eye, when involved), although the period of infectivity may be as long as 14 days.​[[9]](#VaruDMRheeMKAkpekEKEtAl.Conjunctivi-3DD0A400) Handwashing with soap and water (not sanitizer) and using separate towels from noninfected individuals are important for preventing transmission to others. Children should be kept out of school until there is no ocular discharge (approximately 1 week).​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[24]](#LaMattinaKThompsonL.PediatricConjun-A8803A23)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Ocular lubricants may be useful in improving patient comfort​[[23]](#psc1015n01042) (see Dry Eye). **Ophthalmic antihistamines** or **decongestants** may help with severe itching, but are generally not indicated (see [Table 5](#conj_dt3) and [Table 6](#conj_dt5)).

Antiviral agents are usually not indicated in adenovirus infection, although cidofovir (available only through Health Canada’s Special Access Programme) has been used successfully.​[[23]](#psc1015n01042) Ophthalmologists may administer a one-time irrigation with povidone/​iodine 5% ophthalmic solution to prevent the spread of adenoviral conjunctivitis.​[[25]](#ChigbuDILabibBA.PathogenesisAndMana-BC37C464) Corticosteroid eye drops are not commonly used, as they may prolong viral shedding and inhibit immunoclearance.​[[23]](#psc1015n01042) They may be used post-infection as a treatment for visual opacities caused by subepithelial infiltrates. In many cases, however, these infiltrates return after the corticosteroid is discontinued. Treatment with cyclosporine ophthalmic solution may clear subepithelial infiltrates while bypassing the negative effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy.​[[25]](#ChigbuDILabibBA.PathogenesisAndMana-BC37C464) For more information on anti-inflammatory ophthalmic agents, see Dry Eye.

Although HSV conjunctivitis is a self-limited acute condition, corneal involvement requires treatment with **trifluridine** (an ophthalmic antiviral) as monotherapy or in combination with oral antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir). Conjunctivitis due to herpes zoster virus requires treatment with oral antivirals, although trifluridine maybe added on for patients with an insufficient response to oral therapy alone.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[9]](#VaruDMRheeMKAkpekEKEtAl.Conjunctivi-3DD0A400)​[[18]](#psc1015n1009)​[[23]](#psc1015n01042) As of December 2022, trifluridine ophthalmic solution is not available in Canada.

For more information on antiviral agents, see [Table 4](#conj_dt1).

. . . . .

### Allergic Conjunctivitis

### Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis encompasses a group of ocular surface diseases that vary in severity, but are typically associated with Type I hypersensitivity reactions.​[[26]](#Ox2019BrienTP.AllergicConjunctiviti-A88282D1) Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) comprise approximately 95% of allergic conjunctivitis cases. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) are more serious conditions that require assessment and management by an eye-care specialist. VKC commonly occurs in patients 3–8 years of age and resolves in 95% of patients when they reach young adulthood.​[[27]](#ShakerMSalconeE.AnUpdateOnOcularAll-83E42943)​[[28]](#BergerWEGranetDBKabatAG.DiagnosisAn-83E44B85) AKC occurs along with atopic dermatitis and is more likely to lead to corneal complications.

In SAC, patients experience ocular itching, tearing, redness and mild eyelid swelling.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[3]](#psc1015n1003)​[[4]](#psc1015n1004) Although ragweed is the most common airborne cause of allergic rhinitis, grass pollen is considered the most common cause of ocular symptoms.​[[29]](#psc1015n1010)​[[30]](#psc1015n1013) Dry eye can also be a factor in SAC—reduced tear volume leads to decreased capacity to dilute and wash away allergens.

PAC exhibits the same symptoms as SAC, but reactions are triggered by environmental allergens commonly found in the home (e.g., dust mites, mould spores, animal dander). Patients suffer throughout the year, but may have seasonal exacerbations in addition to chronic symptoms.​[[31]](#BieloryLMeltzerEONicholsKKMeltonRTh-A883380C)

Although other ocular conditions (e.g., blepharitis, dry eye) present similarly, the hallmark symptom of SAC is ocular itching, while patients with PAC have red eyes as their primary symptom.​[[26]](#Ox2019BrienTP.AllergicConjunctiviti-A88282D1) For further information on allergic conjunctivitis in relation to allergic rhinitis, see Allergic Rhinitis.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Allergen avoidance is an important first step in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.​[[32]](#psc1015n1014)​[[33]](#psc1015n01043) In SAC, minimize exposure to grassy fields, trees and flowers and keep windows closed to prevent pollens from entering the home. Wash hands after being outdoors and avoid touching/rubbing the eyes while outdoors. Wraparound eyeglasses are an effective means to protect the eyes from pollens and reduce symptoms of SAC.​[[34]](#ComertSKarakayaGKalyoncuAF.Wraparou-F9FEBF29)

In PAC, allergen avoidance may be more problematic as it could involve the family pet.​[[31]](#BieloryLMeltzerEONicholsKKMeltonRTh-A883380C) However, dust mite control measures, proper ventilation of home and office environments, air filtration systems, and awareness of allergen prevalence (pollen and mould counts) can all help to ease symptoms. Washing hair prior to going to bed can also help reduce allergen exposure.

Cold compresses over the eyes offer considerable symptom relief, especially with ocular pruritus.​[[33]](#psc1015n01043)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Ophthalmic Products: Anti-allergy Agents, Antihistamines and Decongestants; Ocular Lubricants.

Ocular lubricants help to wash out allergens and may act as a barrier to pollens.​[[33]](#psc1015n01043) Benzalkonium chloride (a preservative in some lubricants) may irritate eyes, especially if used ≥4 times per day; avoid when possible. Saline or commercial eyewashes can help wash out allergens and reduce eyelid swelling, chemosis (conjunctival edema) and hyperemia (redness due to increased blood flow). These are both first-line treatment options; refrigeration may improve their soothing effect. For more information on available ocular lubricants, see Dry Eye.

Ophthalmic **decongestants** (e.g., naphazoline, phenylephrine, tetrahydrozoline) decrease eye redness and eyelid edema through vasoconstriction. They may cause rebound ocular congestion with prolonged use (time frame not clearly defined, but probably with use >10 days).​[[35]](#psc1015n01045) If rebound congestion occurs, it is likely to be mild and harmless.​[[35]](#psc1015n01045) Ophthalmic decongestants are second-line treatment options for mild-moderate SAC; they are not indicated for prolonged use in PAC. Because they are vasoconstrictors, they are contraindicated in patients with narrow angle (angle-closure) glaucoma. For more information on ophthalmic decongestants, see [Table 6](#conj_dt5).

Brimonidine, a selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist typically used for glaucoma, is available without a prescription in a lower concentration (0.025%) for the treatment of red eye. Based on limited preliminary evidence, brimonidine does not appear to cause significant rebound hyperemia or tachyphylaxis.​[[36]](#AckermanSLTokildsenGLMcLaurinEEtAl.-AEDF4C86)​[[37]](#HostenLOSnyderC.Over-the-counterOcu-AEDF7F06)

**Oral H1** **antihistamines** may relieve itching associated with SAC but do not decrease redness.​[[32]](#psc1015n1014) Ophthalmic antihistamines are available in combination with decongestants (e.g., pheniramine in combination with decongestants listed above) and are preferred over systemic antihistamines because they act faster and are less drying.​[[33]](#psc1015n01043)​[[38]](#psc1015n01044)

Mast cell stabilizers prevent degranulation of mast cells and are useful in both SAC and PAC as they treat the late phase of the allergic response.​[[26]](#Ox2019BrienTP.AllergicConjunctiviti-A88282D1) Regular use during allergy season will prevent redness, itching and eyelid edema. Mast cell stabilizers may take up to 10 days for maximum effect; they must be started before allergy season to prevent symptoms. Lodoxamide and sodium cromoglycate are mast cell–stabilizing agents that alleviate the signs and symptoms of mild to moderate allergic conjunctivitis.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[30]](#psc1015n1013)​[[32]](#psc1015n1014)​[[38]](#psc1015n01044)​[[39]](#CastilloMScottNWMustafaMSEtAl.Topic-F9F5CB16)

Agents that have both antihistaminic and mast cell–stabilizing properties (e.g., olopatadine, ketotifen) will relieve itching quickly while providing long-term activity against ocular irritation by allergens.​[[26]](#Ox2019BrienTP.AllergicConjunctiviti-A88282D1)

For more information on ophthalmic antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, see [Table 5](#conj_dt3).

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops such as ketorolac can decrease the amount of ocular itching and conjunctival redness in allergic conjunctivitis.​[[2]](#psc1015n1002)​[[30]](#psc1015n1013)​[[32]](#psc1015n1014) These agents may cause stinging upon instillation; limit to short-term use to avoid serious corneal effects such as keratitis, ulceration or even corneal perforation. Patients at increased risk of corneal effects include those with dry eye syndrome and those recovering from recent surgery. For more information on ophthalmic NSAIDs, see [Table 7](#conj_dt4).

Once the immediate problem of allergic symptoms is addressed, question the patient about possible dry eye symptoms. Patients with moderate to severe allergic conjunctivitis or those who do not respond to self-care measures within 72 hours require further medical assessment. Severe cases of SAC and VKC may require the use of topical corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents (e.g., cyclosporine, lifitegrast) under the care of an ophthalmologist.​[[30]](#psc1015n1013)​[[32]](#psc1015n1014) For more information on anti-inflammatory ophthalmic agents, see Dry Eye.

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 3](#n01046) provides a monitoring plan that should be individualized for the patient and the condition.

| Viral conjunctivitis (adenovirus) ​ [18] | Patient/family: daily Health-care practitioner: within 1 wk of initiating treatment | Ease symptoms while infection resolves. Prevent transmission to others. | Requires medical assessment to rule out other viral causes. If decongestant or lubricant drops cause irritation, discontinue use or suggest a preservative-free product. |
| Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis ​ [29] ​ [40] | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: within 3 days of initiating drug therapy | Ease patient discomfort. Stop allergic/inflammatory process. Prevent recurrence in future seasons. | If decongestant or lubricant drops cause irritation, discontinue use or suggest a preservative-free product. Requires consultation for further therapy if no improvement within 3 days or if symptoms persist despite treatment. Requires consultation for further therapy if symptoms are severe. |
