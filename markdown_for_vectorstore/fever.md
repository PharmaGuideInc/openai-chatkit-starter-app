### Introduction

Fever is a regulated physiologic response in which a new thermal set point for body temperature is established by the hypothalamus. In response, the body establishes a new equilibrium of heat loss and production to maintain homeostasis at the higher temperature.​[[1]](#c0114n00159) Fever is distinguished from disorders of temperature regulation, such as hyperthermia (see Heat-Related Disorders), where heat production exceeds heat loss without an increase in the thermoregulatory set point. Children <3 months of age and older adults (≥65 years of age) may not mount an elevated temperature in the presence of serious illness but instead may remain normothermic or develop hypothermia.​[[2]](#NormanDC.FeverInTheElderly.ClinInfe-37F93C39)​[[3]](#RaffaeleJLSharmaMBergerSEtAl.Preval-37F987A3)

Normal body temperature varies by 0.5°C throughout the day. A common definition of fever is a rectal or rectal equivalent temperature:​[[4]](#c0114n00132)​[[5]](#psc1009n1001)

- consistently over 38°C, or
- >37.2°C in the early morning or
- >37.8°C at any time.

The febrile response rarely exceeds 41–42°C.​[[1]](#c0114n00159) The most frequent cause of fever is infection, which is part of a beneficial host response to control and eliminate pathogens.​[[6]](#c0114n00152) Fever itself is not harmful. When children develop a fever, some parents have exaggerated concerns about fever, a concept termed “fever phobia”; this concern should be addressed in the management plan.​[[7]](#psc1009n1083) Health-care professionals may also have misconceptions regarding fever.​[[8]](#MayFeverPhobia-757245D1)​[[9]](#KarwowskaHCPFever-75724AE2)

Malaise and fatigue may be seen with a higher temperature or may be due to the underlying illness causing the fever. Discomfort characterized as headache, backache, myalgia, arthralgia, somnolence, chills and rigors may be associated with fever.

There is no evidence that fever aggravates comorbid disease states in patients with heart or pulmonary insufficiency.

### Pathophysiology

The thermoregulatory centre in the anterior hypothalamus normally controls core temperature within a narrow range by balancing heat production by muscle and liver tissues with heat dissipation from skin and lungs. With fever, the thermoregulatory set point is elevated.​[[5]](#psc1009n1001)​[[10]](#psc1009n1002) Endothelial cells of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, a network of enlarged capillaries surrounding the hypothalamus, release arachidonic acid metabolites when exposed to pyrogens in the circulation. Prostaglandin E2, released by the hypothalamus, is thought to be the major substance producing an elevation of the thermoregulatory set point. Initially, with an elevated set point, there is vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels to conserve heat, shivering to increase heat production, and behavioural changes such as seeking warmer environments and clothing. When the set point is reduced through administration of antipyretics or disappearance of pyrogens, the reverse occurs—vasodilation and sweating to dissipate heat, as well as behavioural changes such as removal of clothing.​[[10]](#psc1009n1002)

Sources of pyrogens (substances that cause fever) are both exogenous and endogenous.​[[5]](#psc1009n1001)​[[10]](#psc1009n1002) The most common exogenous sources are microorganisms and their products or toxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharide endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria). Exogenous pyrogens induce formation and release of endogenous pyrogens. Endogenous pyrogens or pyrogenic cytokines are polypeptides produced by host cell macrophages, monocytes and other cells. The most common are interleukin (IL) 1-alpha and 1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, IL-6, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNF) and interferon (IFN) gamma.

### Patient Assessment and Investigations

[Figure 1](#AssessmentofPatientsWithFever) presents an algorithm for the assessment of patients with fever. The term “red flag” is used to note when a serious underlying condition may be present. Investigations are needed before starting antipyretics.

Fever is a symptom or sign, not a diagnosis. Most commonly, fever is an adaptive response to an infection, often viral. Fever may also occur in malignancy or in rheumatologic or immunologic diseases. Children <6 months of age with a fever should be assessed by an appropriate health-care practitioner.​[[13]](#psc1009n1013)

- History and physical examination should be performed to ascertain associated symptoms, signs and the source of fever.
- Clinical judgment determines whether the underlying process is benign (e.g., viral upper respiratory tract infection) or life-threatening (e.g., bacterial meningitis, pneumonia).
- Bacteremia is more likely present if the temperature is >41.1°C ;​[[14]](#TrautnerBWCavinessACGerlacherGREtAl-37FA8C04) therefore, blood cultures may be warranted.
- Aggressiveness of the laboratory and diagnostic imaging evaluation depends on the clinical assessment of the severity of illness, symptoms pointing to a focus of infection (e.g., urinary tract, respiratory tract), the patient’s age (especially in children <3 months of age or in older adults) or if the patient has comorbidities or immunodeficiency.​[[10]](#psc1009n1002)​[[11]](#psc1009n1003)​[[15]](#BursteinBLiretteMPBeckCEtAl.Managem-37FB7BF3)

  - may include culture of suspected sources of infection (e.g., urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid) or imaging studies (e.g., chest radiograph)
  - nonspecific tests such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein or WBC ± differential are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to replace clinical assessment of the severity of illness​[[15]](#BursteinBLiretteMPBeckCEtAl.Managem-37FB7BF3)

Fever persisting >3 days in those >6 months of age, recurrent fever or high fever (>40.5°C) should be evaluated by an appropriate health-care practitioner (see [Figure 1](#AssessmentofPatientsWithFever) for red flags).

Fever is one of the adverse effects that can occur with immunization. Studies on the use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen administered shortly before or shortly after immunization (prophylactic use) have shown no benefit with respect to the development of fever.​[[16]](#BraccioSSalibaVRamsayMEtAl.Question-58710D83)​[[17]](#WalterEBHornikCPGrohskopfLEtAl.TheE-58711061) If a fever develops post vaccine administration and the person is uncomfortable, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be administered.​[[18]](#CanadianPaediatricSociety.CaringFor-58711404)​[[19]](#ImmunizeCanada.PainManagementDuring-58711A18) Prophylactic analgesics have also shown no benefit with respect to reduction in pain at the time of vaccination​[[20]](#ShahVTaddioAMcMurtryCMEtAl.Pharmaco-58711E40) and are presently not recommended in the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-8-vaccine-administration-practices.html).

Although uncommon, fever may be drug-induced; [Table 1](#psc1009n01099) lists medications that may be associated with drug-induced fever.

**Table 1:** Selected Drugs Associated with Fever​[[21]](#psc1009n1010)[[22]](#psc1009n1011)[[23]](#psc1009n1012)

### Measurement of Body Temperature

Measurement of core body temperature (e.g., viscera, major arteries) is invasive and impractical except in ICU settings; therefore the oral, rectal, axillary, temporal artery, tympanic membrane and transcutaneous routes are used to approximate core temperature. Different anatomic sites have different temperatures, so all are approximations of body temperature.​[[5]](#psc1009n1001) In adults and children >5 years of age, *oral* thermometry is recommended for confirmation of fever​[[1]](#c0114n00159)​[[4]](#c0114n00132). In children ≤5 years of age, *rectal* thermometry is the gold standard in Canada for definitive measurement to reduce the instance of measurement error.​[[4]](#c0114n00132) Other temperature measurement methods can be used as a screening tool for low-risk children; these include *tympanic* temperature measurement in children ≥2 years of age and *axillary* temperature measurement in children of all ages.​[[4]](#c0114n00132) Invasive measurement of temperature in critically ill adults and children, and temperature control in this population, is beyond the scope of this chapter.

The noninvasive methods of measuring temperature in the ambulatory setting (rectal, oral, axillary, ear/tympanic membrane, transcutaneous and temporal artery) are listed in [Table 2](#psc1009n01114).​[[13]](#psc1009n1013) Oral, rectal and axillary temperatures may be taken with an electronic thermometer with a digital display (digital probe). Normal, route-specific temperature ranges and preferred routes in children are listed in [Table 3](#psc1009n01116).

**Table 2:** Methods of Measuring Body Temperature

| Method | Description | Instructions For Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rectal​ [13] | Recommended for definitive temperature measurement in children <2 y . It is contraindicated in premature infants,​ [5] the immunocompromised​ [24] and in the presence of rectal anomalies, recent anorectal surgery or severe hemorrhoids. A rare complication is perforation of the rectum. | For children: place the child on their back with knees bent. For adults: lay patient in fetal position on flat surface. Lubricate anus and thermometer with petroleum jelly (pea-size quantity). With one hand, gently insert thermometer 2–3 cm into rectum. Hold buttocks closed against thermometer with other hand. Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Oral​ [13] | Can be used in children >5 y and adults. Not routinely recommended in children <2 y. Using this method may not be possible in individuals who have difficulty understanding instructions, e.g., people with mental impairment or patients with dementia.​ [5] Avoid the oral route when nasal breathing is difficult, e.g., due to viral upper respiratory tract infection; mouth breathing may cause spuriously low temperatures. Beverages, either hot or cold, and smoking should be avoided for at least 10 min prior to taking an oral temperature.​ [5] ​ [24] | Place thermometer on either side of mouth (between gum and cheek) or under the tongue. Hold in place with lips or fingers (not the teeth). Have patient breathe through nose with mouth closed. Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Axilla​ [13] | Axillary (armpit) temperatures are recommended for screening temperature assessment of low-risk children <5 y. Disadvantages of this route are the length of time needed to obtain a temperature and variation due to a number of factors including hypotension, cutaneous vasodilation and prior cooling of the patient. Although axillary temperatures are generally considered to be approximately 0.5°C lower than oral temperatures, reliable data are not available to support this correlation. The advantages of axillary temperatures are that this route is very accessible, safe and may be less frightening to children than rectal temperatures.​ [24] The reading should be confirmed via another route if the axillary temperature is >37.2°C . | Place thermometer in apex of axilla. Have patient hold elbow against chest to stabilize the thermometer. Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Ear​ [25] | The tympanic membrane and the hypothalamus share the same blood supply. The TT may better reflect core temperature measurements.​ [5] The temperature is then converted by the thermometer to reflect oral or rectal temperatures, which may lead to some inaccuracy in the temperature reading. Proper placement in the ear canal is important.​ [26] Improper placement can result in a lower reading that reflects the outer ear canal wall temperature.​ [26] There may be a poor correlation between tympanic and rectal temperatures and a TT may not be sensitive enough to screen for fever in pediatric patients.​ [27] ​ [28] ​ [29] Performance was good in adults, including older patients.​ [30] The Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend a TT for children <2 y .​ [13] Advantages of a TT include simplicity, speed and patient acceptance.​ [24] Less than 2 s is needed to obtain a reading. Other advantages include lack of external influences such as hot beverage ingestion and no mucous membrane contact; therefore, there is a decreased risk of disease transmission.​ [24] Acute otitis media and nonobstructive cerumen do not appear to affect the accuracy of a TT .​ [31] A disadvantage is the high cost of the thermometer. | Follow specific manufacturer’s directions as they may vary. Before taking the temperature, ensure the ear is free from excess earwax. Apply a clean probe tip or lens filter. Turn the thermometer on. Gently tug on ear, pulling it back. This helps to straighten the ear canal so an accurate reading can be obtained. Gently insert the thermometer into the ear until the ear canal is fully sealed off; point straight towards opposite ear or temple. Push start button; it will beep when temperature is recorded. |
| Transcutaneous | “Fever strips” contain encapsulated thermophototropic esters of cholesterol (called liquid crystals) that change colour in response to temperature changes. They are easier to read and require less time than a standard thermometer, but are less reliable because skin temperature is not a reliable indicator of core temperature.​ [5] ​ [13] ​ [24] ​ [26] ​ [32] ​ [33] When studied in emergency departments, fever strips were poor predictors of fever.​ [33] ​ [34] Accuracy is affected by ambient temperatures such as cold hands holding the strip or nearby heat sources such as a lamp. A truly febrile patient may register as afebrile, possibly delaying medical attention. | Based on poor performance in studies, use cannot be recommended for children or adults. |
| Temporal artery (forehead)​ [35] | Like the TT , the TA thermometer uses infrared technology to measure the temperature using a heat balance method.​ [36] Infrared sensors compute a temporal artery temperature by rapid, repeated measures to synthesize skin surface and ambient temperature. It is similar to a TT in that it is very quick (3 s) and avoids any mucous membrane contact.​ [36] It may be prone to less error than a TT ​ [37] but is not considered as accurate as rectal temperatures in children.​ [37] ​ [38] ​ [39] A meta-analysis showed insufficient accuracy to substitute a TA thermometer for currently available temperature measurement methods.​ [40] | Follow specific manufacturer’s directions as they may vary. Remove dirt, hair or sweat from forehead area. Turn unit on. Press button a second time. Position the device 0–2 cm away from the centre of the forehead just between the eyebrows. The device does not need to make contact with the forehead. A beep will sound when the temperature has been recorded. |

**Table 3:** Normal Pediatric Temperature Ranges Associated with Measurement Technique​[[13]](#psc1009n1013)

| Measurement Technique | Normal Temperature Range |
| --- | --- |
| Axilla | 36.5–37.5°C (97.8–99.5°F) |
| Ear | 35.8–37.9°C (96.4–100.2°F) |
| Oral | 35.5–37.5°C (95.9–99.5°F) |
| Rectal | 36.6–37.9°C (97.9–100.2°F) |

### Goals of Therapy

- Provide patient comfort
- Balance the benefit of symptomatic treatment with possible adverse effects and cost of medication
- In children, relieve parental anxiety
- In pregnant patients during the first trimester, reduce risk of adverse fetal outcome(s)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions for fever include removal of excess clothing and bedding, increased fluid intake to replace insensible water loss during fever, maintenance of ambient temperatures around 20–21°C, and avoidance of physical exertion.​[[13]](#psc1009n1013)​[[41]](#WattsRRobertsonJ.Non-pharmacologica-37FCC775)

Physical methods for heat reduction use convection, evaporation or conduction to counteract the body’s attempt to maintain a higher temperature set point (fever). The body opposes physical cooling by attempting to re-establish a high temperature through shivering and vasoconstriction,​[[42]](#c0114n00134) which are uncomfortable and theoretically could increase metabolic work. Tepid sponging results in a decrease in body temperature; however, it is uncomfortable for the patient and the effect is of short duration. Antipyretics should be administered prior to physical cooling methods to reset the hypothalamic set point; otherwise, the body works to reach the higher set point. There are few studies comparing physical methods to antipyretics in children. Pharmacologic methods are preferred because they lower the hypothalamic set point.​[[42]](#c0114n00134)

In the rare instance where core temperatures exceed 41–42°C, physical methods may be used in addition to pharmacologic methods. Given the increased risk of bacterial infections in patients with temperatures exceeding 41°C, these methods should be used outside of the hospital setting only after the patient has been investigated for serious disease.

- Sponging with tepid or cold water uses evaporation to dissipate body heat. Sponging with alcohol is *not recommended*, as it may be absorbed through the skin, inhaled or accidentally ingested by the patient. Sponging with alcohol has been associated with hypoglycemia, intoxication and coma.​[[43]](#AxelrodP.ExternalCoolingInTheManage-54105CEF)​[[44]](#GarrisonRF.AcutePoisoningFromUseOfI-54105121)
- Ice packs or cooling (hypothermia) blankets may be applied to the skin to lower body temperature by conduction.
- Circulating fans, sometimes directed over ice before reaching the patient, use convection to transfer heat away from the skin surface.

### Pharmacologic Choices

There are many arguments against treating a fever:​[[5]](#psc1009n1001)​[[10]](#psc1009n1002)​[[45]](#Aronoff-75847520)​[[46]](#Styrt-75853296)​[[47]](#El-RadhiAS-75853680)

- Fever is an important defence mechanism; it enhances the immune response.
- Use of antipyretics may impair the use of temperature as an important clinical tool for monitoring the progress of an infection or response to antibiotics.
- Fever is usually self-limiting and, though sometimes distressing, the associated symptoms of fever (mild dehydration, discomfort, febrile delirium and febrile seizures) are usually not harmful.

Therefore, the decision to use antipyretics must be individualized. The goal should be reduction of fever rather than “normal” body temperature. Assessment of the patient should not depend solely on the elevation of temperature (see [Figure 1](#AssessmentofPatientsWithFever)).

Acetaminophen, ASA, ibuprofen and naproxen **sodium** are all currently indicated to reduce fever; however, naproxen is not indicated in children <12 years of age and ASA should not be used in children <18 years of age. Antipyretics reduce body temperature in febrile patients by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis in the brain and reducing the thermoregulatory set point.​[[5]](#psc1009n1001)​[[45]](#Aronoff-75847520) They do not lower normal body temperature. Short-term treatment with these drugs is associated with few side effects. Intermittent administration of antipyretics may result in drug-induced fluctuations in temperature and concomitant shivering, which may make the individual feel worse. Use at regular intervals may reduce patient discomfort and the risk of increased metabolic demand caused by shivering. However, it is not necessary to wake a person who is sleeping to administer antipyretics.​[[4]](#c0114n00132)

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been studied in large populations and are considered safe in therapeutic doses.​[[6]](#c0114n00152) National guidelines for children in the US and UK​[[48]](#psc0114n00146) recommend use of antipyretics only for the treatment goal of patient comfort. The dose, frequency of administration and adverse effects associated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen differ (see [Table 4](#c0114n00019)). With regard to efficacy in temperature reduction in children, one systematic review of randomized trials showed comparable efficacy of a single dose of either acetaminophen or ibuprofen in terms of pain relief, with about 15% more patients in the ibuprofen group having temperature reduction at 4 and 6 hours.​[[51]](#c0114n00151) The clinical significance of these marginal benefits is unclear.

There is no evidence that reduction of temperature via antipyretic therapy is beneficial; thus, the main goal of antipyretic therapy in nonpregnant patients is patient comfort. In a pregnant patient who is in the first trimester, the goal of antipyresis is protection of the fetus.​[[6]](#c0114n00152)​[[52]](#c0114n00144)

In theory, antipyretic therapy may be justified if the metabolic demands of fever (increased metabolic rate, norepinephrine-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction, increased oxygen consumption) are greater than the clinical benefits.​[[10]](#psc1009n1002) As a result, textbooks still recommend aggressive antipyretic therapy in patients with underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease​[[53]](#Harrisonx2019sPrinciplesOfInternalM-757D608C) despite the lack of evidence to support this practice. Similarly, antipyretics are recommended by some experts to reverse fever-induced mental dysfunction in older patients, but benefits of this practice have not been studied clinically.

Available antipyretics also have analgesic effects, which can decrease discomfort if present. Most guidelines for children recommend consideration of antipyretics only for febrile patients who appear distressed or unwell.​[[6]](#c0114n00152)​[[48]](#psc0114n00146) Evidence indicates that antipyretic therapy does not prevent febrile seizures, a phenomenon that may occur in any patient but are most common in children about 6 months to 6 years of age.​[[6]](#c0114n00152)​[[54]](#c0114n00161)​[[55]](#c0114n00163)

A response to antipyretic therapy does not exclude the possibility that serious underlying illness is present. Clinical decision-making should not be based on response to fever treatment.

While ASA may be used for fever in adults, it is not recommended in children or adolescents because of the potentially increased risk of Reye syndrome.​[[56]](#AspirinAndReye-7583E302)

Naproxen sodium is the most recent nonprescription NSAID available for fever. It has a longer half-life with a corresponding less frequent administration schedule. There are little data on the use of naproxen sodium for treatment of fever in children with viral infections. It is not indicated in those under the age of 12.

Some clinicians recommend alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen administration to reduce fever; however, there is insufficient evidence to support this as a routine practice and it is not recommended.​[[6]](#c0114n00152)​[[48]](#psc0114n00146)​[[57]](#c0114n00164)​[[58]](#WadeKCMathisC.AntipyreticStrategies-5873F177) While alternating or combining acetaminophen and ibuprofen may result in a greater period of time without fever, the clinical benefit of this difference is uncertain.​[[59]](#DeLaCruz-MenaJEVeronikiAAAcosta-Rey-5873F4B0) It is important to note that no difference was found in patient discomfort in the only 2 trials that assessed it.​[[57]](#c0114n00164) This practice has not been shown to be either safe or more effective in improving discomfort than a single antipyretic. In addition, potential risks of prescribing 2 antipyretics may include dosing confusion and errors with associated toxicity.

Acetaminophen is safer than NSAIDs in older individuals who have risk factors predisposing to gastrointestinal and renal toxicity.

### Optimizing Antipyretic Dosing and Administration in Children

In febrile children who do not have red flags (see [Figure 1](#AssessmentofPatientsWithFever)), review the following points with all parents when recommending an antipyretic preparation:

- Ensure parents/caregivers understand that fever is rarely harmful and does not have to be treated.
- Explain that comfort is the goal and not achievement of an arbitrary normal temperature.
- Explain when to seek medical assessment.
- Assist parents/caregivers in calculating the correct weight-based dose (mg/kg) of the drug and ensure they know the maximum number of doses that can be administered in a 24-hour period.

  - In a study of 100 caregivers given a mock dosing scenario that required them to determine and measure a correct dose of acetaminophen for their child, only 40% stated an appropriate dose for their child.​[[60]](#psc1009n1088)
  - Of 118 children given an antipyretic at home and subsequently brought to the emergency department, only 47% had been given a proper dose.​[[61]](#psc1009n1089) Underdosing may be a cause of unnecessary emergency department visits.​[[62]](#psc1009n1090) This also leads to added stress for both the parent/caregiver and sick child.​[[63]](#psc1009n1091)
- Ensure the parent/caregiver has and will use an appropriate measuring device.

  - In the mock dosing study reported above, only 67% of caregivers accurately measured the amount they intended to give. Forty-three percent measured out a correct amount of acetaminophen; however, 30% of these did so accidently by measuring an improper dose.​[[60]](#psc1009n1088)
  - Consider demonstrating the correct use of the dosing device. Ask the caregiver to repeat instructions back to you. It may be helpful to mark the dosing device with the correct dose.​[[64]](#ChiappiniEPrincipiNLonghiREtAl.Mana-8BABCF92)
- Ask what form of product they have at home and calculate the appropriate volume of liquid or number of tablets for the child. Explain the differences in concentration between drops and syrup and that tablets come in different strengths for children.​[[64]](#ChiappiniEPrincipiNLonghiREtAl.Mana-8BABCF92)

  - Multiple miscalculated overdoses of acetaminophen given by parents/caregivers represent an important cause of acetaminophen toxicity.​[[65]](#psc1009n1092)​[[66]](#psc1009n1093)​[[67]](#psc1009n1094)
  - Use of incorrect measuring devices, differences in medication concentrations (e.g., pediatric drops vs. suspensions), use of adult formulations for pediatric patients and unrecognized acetaminophen content in multiple-ingredient cough and cold products contribute to this problem.​[[66]](#psc1009n1093)
- Ask about other preparations parents/caregivers may be coadministering and ensure they are aware of the antipyretic content of these products. The coadministration of these products should be carefully monitored to ensure the cumulative dose is within the recommended daily range.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Studies suggest that exposure to fever and other heat sources during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased risk of neural tube defects and multiple congenital abnormalities​[[68]](#psc1009n1079)​[[69]](#psc1009n1080) and, therefore, temperature reduction may be considered in these patients. Although one study indicated a possible benefit of antipyretic therapy,​[[70]](#psc1009n1081) others have not​[[71]](#psc1009n1082) and a meta-analysis suggests additional research is required.​[[72]](#DreierJWAndersenABerg-BeckhoffG.Sys-8BAABB94)

Acetaminophen has been commonly used and considered safe in pregnancy; however, its safety in pregnancy has been challenged by studies suggesting possible associations with neurodevelopmental problems.​[[73]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKDrugsInPregnancyAn-B1DB6EB1)​[[74]](#ChurchPTWernerEDavisJM.Acetaminophe-37FE6683)​[[75]](#MatosichSKelsbergGSafranekS.Prenata-37FE9E29) The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists identifies acetaminophen as one of the only safe pain relievers in pregnancy and states there is no clear evidence of a direct link between acetaminophen use during any trimester and fetal development issues.​[[76]](#AmericanCollegeOfObstetriciansAndGy-37FEF008) As with any drugs used in pregnancy, the drug should be clearly indicated and used for the shortest time necessary.

Use of **ASA** and **NSAIDs** can result in a number of problems during pregnancy such as interference of labour and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus resulting in many effects including persistent pulmonary hypertension in the infant. Platelet aggregation is inhibited in the newborn if ASA is ingested by the birth parent within 7 days of delivery and salicylates displace bilirubin from protein binding sites. Increased bleeding has been reported in both the birth parent and infant if ASA is ingested close to the time of delivery.​[[77]](#psc1009n1046) ASA and NSAIDs should be avoided in the first and third trimesters.​[[73]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKDrugsInPregnancyAn-B1DB6EB1)

Acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safe to take while breastfeeding; ASA should be used cautiously if used at all.​[[73]](#BriggsGGFreemanRKDrugsInPregnancyAn-B1DB6EB1)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Monitoring of Therapy

A person’s temperature should be taken if they feel warm or look ill to determine the initial temperature. Subsequently, temperatures need not be taken more than 2–4 times daily unless the patient has recently received chemotherapy, for which referral to the emergency department is of utmost importance (see [Figure 1](#AssessmentofPatientsWithFever) for red flags). Recommendations for frequent monitoring of temperature in children likely contribute to parental concern and fever phobia in pediatric patients. If fever has persisted for more than 3 days, or if the fever has persisted for more than 24 hours without an apparent cause, medical attention should be sought. The degree of illness and not the temperature should guide therapy and referral.

Monitor:

- All patients given antipyretics for development of rash or allergic reactions
- Patients with pre-existing comorbid illness for edema and decreased urine output
- For signs and symptoms of dehydration; if NSAIDs are used, discontinue the drug immediately if dehydration occurs
- For common side effects, such as GI intolerance and tinnitus (see [Table 4](#c0114n00019))
- To ensure appropriate doses, products and measuring devices are being used
- To ensure the patient is not receiving more than the maximum recommended dose of any antipyretic, e.g., through use of coadministered cough and cold or analgesic products
- To ensure the patient is not receiving interacting medications (see [Table 4](#c0114n00019)); recommend avoiding alcohol consumption

### Therapeutic Tips

- Ask about other concomitant preparations (particularly cough and cold products) and ensure patients/caregivers are aware of the antipyretic content of these products. The coadministration of these products should be carefully monitored to ensure the cumulative dose is within the recommended range.
- Concentrations of liquid acetaminophen and ibuprofen preparations vary according to product. Patients/caregivers should check the concentration of a product each time medication is used.
- In children, use doses of acetaminophen or ibuprofen based on the child’s weight, not on age. Maximum dose per day should be specified.
- Use a calibrated measuring device for dosing and educate parents/caregivers about the many formulations available and the potential for error with substitution or the combination of products.

### Drug Table

**Table 4:** Drug Therapy for Fever

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class:NSAIDs**

| ibuprofen Advil , Advil (Children's) , Motrin , Motrin (Children's) , generics < $1 | Children <6 months : 5 mg/kg Q8H PO PRN; maximum 40 mg/kg/day ; do not exceed the adult dose Children >6 months : 5–10 mg/kg Q6–8H PO PRN for symptom management; maximum 40 mg/kg/day ; do not exceed the adult dose Adults: 200–400 mg Q4-6H PO PRN; maximum for self-care 1200 mg/day ; maximum if supervised by HCP 2400 mg/day | Uncommon with infrequent use and recommended dose. GI intolerance and bleeding, allergic reactions, tinnitus, visual disturbances, nephropathy. Sodium and water retention. Dehydration enhances risk of renal toxicity. Platelet dysfunction can result in increased bleeding risk. | Increased risk of GI pain/ulceration with alcohol, corticosteroids. Antagonism of hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitor, beta-blockers, diuretics. Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants, SSRI s. Increased levels of cyclosporine (and risk of nephrotoxicity) with methotrexate​ [b] , lithium. Reduction of ASA antiplatelet effects when combined with ibuprofen. | Renal dysfunction: no adjustment required; however, should be avoided in renal dysfunction due to effects of prostaglandin inhibition on renal function. Do not give if dehydration is present; ensure patient has adequate intake of fluids. NSAID s have been associated with an increased risk of severe skin and soft tissue infections in children with chicken pox and to a lesser extent in adults with shingles.​ [49] Limited data exist for the use of ibuprofen in children <2 months of age. Some nonprescription products contain ibuprofen in combination with other drugs; advise parents/ caregivers to check labels carefully to avoid inadvertent administration of excessive doses. |
| naproxen sodium Aleve , Anaprox , Maxidol , generics < $1 | Children <12 y : not recommended Adults: 220 mg Q8–12H PO PRN; maximum 440 mg/day | Uncommon with infrequent use and recommended dose. GI intolerance and bleeding, allergic reactions, tinnitus, visual disturbances, nephropathy. Sodium and water retention. Dehydration enhances risk of renal toxicity. Platelet dysfunction can result in increased bleeding risk. | Increased risk of GI pain/ulceration with alcohol, corticosteroids. Antagonism of hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitor, beta-blockers, diuretics. Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants, SSRI s. Increased levels of cyclosporine (and risk of nephrotoxicity) with methotrexate​ [b] , lithium. | Renal dysfunction: no adjustment required; however, should be avoided in renal dysfunction due to effects of prostaglandin inhibition on renal function. Do not give if dehydration is present; ensure patient has adequate intake of fluids. NSAID s have been associated with an increased risk of severe skin and soft tissue infections in children with chicken pox and to a lesser extent in adults with shingles.​ [49] |

**Drug Class: Para-aminophenol Derivatives**

| acetaminophen Tempra , Tylenol , generics < $1 | Children: 10–15 mg/kg Q4–6H PO/PR PRN for symptom management; maximum 75 mg/kg/day ; do not exceed the adult dose Adults: 325–650 mg Q4-6H PO/PR PRN; maximum 4000 mg/day | Uncommon with infrequent use and recommended dose. Hypersensitivity, agranulocytosis, anemia (rare). Chronic use and overdose associated with hepatotoxicity, nephropathy. Potential for toxicity enhanced if concurrent dehydration, prolonged fasting, diabetes mellitus, obesity, concomitant viral infection or family history of hepatotoxic reaction. | Increased risk of hepatotoxicity with alcohol and isoniazid. Decreased acetaminophen levels with enzyme inducers, e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin. Acetaminophen has been reported to increase INR in warfarin-treated patients. Check INR if acetaminophen ≥2 g/day is used for ≥3 consecutive days. Adjust warfarin dosage as required. | Use with caution in patients with liver dysfunction or active liver disease. Rectal administration results in erratic absorption, which the patient should be advised of. Available as oral drops, tablets, chewable tablets, suppositories and suspension. Acetaminophen may be associated with exacerbation of wheezing in febrile children.​ [50] Many nonprescription products contain acetaminophen in combination with other drugs. Advise patients/ caregivers to check labels carefully to avoid inadvertent administration of excessive doses. |

**Drug Class: Salicylates**

| ASA Aspirin , generics < $1 | Children <18 y : not recommended; avoid use Adults: 325–650 mg Q4–6H PO PRN; maximum 4000 mg/day | GI upset. Avoid in patients with renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, heart failure and ASA-sensitive asthma. | Increased risk of GI pain/ulceration with alcohol, corticosteroids. Antagonism of hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitor, beta-blockers, diuretics. Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants, SSRI s. Increased levels of cyclosporine (and risk of nephrotoxicity) with methotrexate​ [b] , lithium. Reduction of ASA antiplatelet effects when combined with ibuprofen. ASA may decrease therapeutic effect of uricosuric agents, e.g., probenecid, sulfinpyrazone. | Avoid if ClCr <10 mL/min . Enteric-coated products will have delayed onset of action. |

[[a]](#fnsrc_drufnad605660e1623) Cost per day; includes drug cost only.

[b] More likely to occur with antineoplastic doses of methotrexate.
