### Introduction

Home diagnostic devices are used for early diagnosis, to determine whether a certain therapy is effective, to monitor a medical condition and for screening. Their advantages include confidentiality, convenience, relatively immediate results and an increased understanding of a condition. Considered by some to be the “ultimate house call,”​[[2]](#psc1090n1001) home diagnostic devices are meant to augment appropriate medical care. Consumer demand for timely information about personal health combined with the economics of the health-care system, which may limit resources, have resulted in a proliferation of home diagnostic tests. Advances in technology have increased ease of use and accuracy.​[[1]](#GobleJARocafortPT.Point-of-careTest-95EF3E0A)

Home testing does not replace appropriate medical care and professional counselling, and there are potential pitfalls. The privacy afforded by home testing can contribute to misinformation, avoidance of treatment and even misdiagnosis, all of which may adversely affect health. Some home diagnostic devices may be inaccurate/inconsistent or test for conditions that may not be appropriate for home testing, e.g., metabolic hormone tests. False positive test results can lead to more tests, which may be expensive, time consuming and cause patient anxiety. Testing can lead to overdiagnosis and treatment (including side effects thereof) for a condition that would not have been significant if undetected.

This chapter addresses home tests for blood pressure, cholesterol, menopause, drug detection, alcohol use, blood coagulation, celiac disease and urine, as well as some miscellaneous tests. Two commonly used home testing measures that have become integral to the management of the respective conditions (blood glucose devices and pregnancy/fertility tests) are discussed in Diabetes Care Devices and Pregnancy and Fertility Testing.

### Blood Pressure

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Home Testing Products: Electronic Blood Pressure Monitors.

Hypertension is asymptomatic, but is a leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality.​[[3]](#BromfieldSMuntnerP.HighBloodPressur-012AE755) It is estimated that 1 in 5 Canadian adults has hypertension. One-third of those with hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure and one-fifth are unaware that they have hypertension. Of those patients who are aware of their hypertension, only 64% are adequately treated (BP <140/90) with medication.​[[4]](#psc1090n01057)

Home blood pressure monitoring enables individuals to evaluate whether a new drug or treatment is working, to chart their course (which may act as motivation for adherence) and to identify white coat hypertension. Based on low-quality evidence, Hypertension Canada guidelines suggest that the use of home blood pressure monitoring may be used to diagnose hypertension and that its use on a regular basis should be considered in people with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, suspected nonadherence, demonstrated white coat hypertension, and blood pressure controlled in the office but not at home (masked hypertension).​[[5]](#NerenbergKAZarnkeKBLeungAAEtAl.Hype-95F0CE65)​[[6]](#psc1090n1004)

Home blood pressure monitoring should never be considered for self-diagnosis of hypertension. If the blood pressure is elevated with home blood pressure readings, medical advice should be sought.

### Electronic Blood Pressure Monitors

Electronic blood pressure monitors are oscillometric, i.e., they measure blood pressure by analyzing small changes in cuff pressure.​[[7]](#psc1090n1006)​[[8]](#psc1090n1007) The pressure in the inflated cuff changes as blood moves through expanding and contracting blood vessels. Most electronic monitors have a liquid crystal diode display, which makes reading the blood pressure numbers easy. Pulse readings are often provided along with blood pressure readings. Accuracy can be a problem with electronic models. If the reading is consistently too high or too low, it may still be used to evaluate trends, but if the monitor reads too high one time and too low the next, readings have no value. Once purchased, electronic models should be compared in accuracy with blood pressure readings done by a health-care practitioner. This comparison should be repeated periodically. Hypertension Canada endorses electronic models that meet accepted validation standards. A heart with a check mark logo appears on the endorsed models.​[[9]](#psc1090n1009)

The proper technique for using blood pressure monitors is important, and should be checked from time to time to ensure no bad habits have developed.​[[10]](#psc1090n1010) The blood pressure reading should be taken under the same circumstances and at approximately the same time of day. Blood pressure changes with daily cycles, and is typically the lowest during sleep. Activities that can raise blood pressure include public speaking, strenuous exercise, sexual activity and competitive video gaming.​[[12]](#psc1090n1054)​[[13]](#psc1090n1055)

Principles of accurate blood pressure measurement include the following:

- Patient should not exercise within the preceding 30 minutes.
- Cigarettes, caffeine and decongestant medications should be avoided for about an hour before the blood pressure measurement is taken.
- The bladder and bowels should be emptied prior to the reading.
- Ensure the right cuff size is chosen. Cuff size is based on the measurement of the upper arm. For people with thin arms less than 23 cm, there are small cuffs. An adult cuff ranges from 23–33 cm; a large from 33–43 cm. There are also cuff sizes for children.
- Sitting in a chair in a warm, calm environment with both feet on the floor, ankles not crossed, is recommended. The arm in which the blood pressure is to be measured should rest on a firm surface such as a table, palm up, and at the level of the heart. Bulky clothing can interfere with the reading and should be removed. Cuff is placed mid-arm, at heart level, with the bottom of the cuff 3 cm from the fold of the elbow.
- Talking while measuring blood pressure will affect the reading.
- It is recommended that 2 or 3 readings be taken at 1 time, resting for about 5 minutes between each reading. The readings can be compared and averaged. Keeping a log of blood pressure readings will reflect what is normal for an individual and the effect of various activities or medications on blood pressure readings.

Electronic models that work on the wrist may be used for blood pressure estimation in those patients with large arm circumference when standard upper arm methods cannot be used.​[[11]](#HypertensionCanada.DiagnosisAndAsse-CB8DB1B1)

### Cholesterol

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Home Testing Products: Cholesterol Test Kits.

Elevated cholesterol levels increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. It is estimated that 40% of Canadians have high cholesterol. In-office screening of high-risk individuals and lowering cholesterol levels with diet or medication reduce mortality and morbidity.​[[14]](#psc1090n1011)​[[15]](#psc1090n1012)

Cholesterol home tests screen only for elevated total cholesterol; it should be noted that the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia do not include cholesterol home tests as a method of screening.​[[14]](#psc1090n1011) These tests use an optical reader to determine total cholesterol in a blood sample. A drop of blood is drawn using a lancet and placed on a test strip. Most test strips do not require wiping, but rather use capillary action to move the blood sample to the optical reader.

The test strip is impregnated with a reagent that reacts with cholesterol in the blood sample to produce a colour change. The optical reader uses light absorption to determine the degree of colour change, and thus the cholesterol content of the sample. The results are expressed digitally on a liquid crystal diode display.

Test results take 3–15 minutes, depending upon the device, and represent total cholesterol. Home tests do not distinguish among low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and triglycerides. To obtain a breakdown of the cholesterol fractions, a laboratory procedure is required.

### Menopause

Home diagnostic tests for menopause look for a constantly high level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). During a normal menstrual cycle, FSH levels vary, rising as an ovum matures in the ovaries and falling after the release of the ovum at midcycle. With decreasing ovarian function closer to menopause, the body produces less estrogen, causing FSH levels to remain constantly high. However, the Canadian Consensus Conference on Menopause, 2006 indicates that the measurement of FSH alone is not indicative of menopause.​[[16]](#psc1090n1013)

The test is an immunochromatographic one-step test that uses enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) to detect FSH in urine. A positive result is indicated by a colour change, and 2 positive tests taken a week apart indicate a constantly high level of FSH consistent with menopause. Therefore, if the 1​st test is positive, it should be repeated 1 week later.

A control is built into the test to ensure the test itself is working; however, damaged or expired test material should not be used. The test should be performed using the 1​st urine of the morning because it has the highest concentration of FSH. This also ensures the 2 tests are performed at about the same time each day, minimizing the effect of diurnal variation.

Oral contraceptives and hormone supplements can cause false-negative results by decreasing levels of FSH. During pregnancy, FSH levels are elevated, and an undetected pregnancy will result in a false-positive result, as will ovarian or pituitary tumours, which increase FSH levels. Many incorrect results are due to human error—damaging the absorbent end of the test wand, using too small or too large a urine sample, turning the wand upside down after sampling, or reading the results too early or too late.

Home tests alone are not diagnostic of menopause, and other criteria such as cessation of menstrual periods need to be considered.​[[17]](#psc1090n1014) Menopause home tests do not indicate the presence or absence of fertility, and should never be the basis of a contraceptive decision. Menopause occurs over months and years; therefore, menopause home test kits are limited in that they capture FSH levels only in a general quantitative way at a specific time.

### Multiple Drug Detection

Some drugs are abused, are potentially addictive, can impair cognitive functioning and/or are the subject of workplace drug screening. These drugs can result in health complications and self-harm. Of special concern are cannabis, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamine, cocaine and opiates such as heroin.​[[18]](#psc1090n1015)​[[19]](#psc1090n1016)​[[20]](#psc1090n1017) With the legalization of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use, home testing kits may become more common and more sensitive, as will those kits used by law enforcement agencies.

Home drug detection kits are urine tests that use ELISA technology. Maximum time after last use that drugs can be detected ranges from 3–30 days, depending upon the drug, its usage and the testing kit purchased. Other drug detection kits use hair or saliva samples, which usually require mailing to a testing laboratory, sometimes located in the United States.

- The maximum time after last use that cannabis can be detected ranges from 2–8 days; however this increases to 20–30 days with chronic use. False-positive results have been associated with hemp-containing foods (usually labelled as such), NSAIDs (ibuprofen and naproxen) and the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. It is not clear whether other members of these drug classes have the same effect. Second-hand marijuana smoke does not usually cause false-positive results.​[[21]](#psc1090n1018)
- The maximum time after last use that

  phencyclidine can be detected ranges from 3–7 days (14–30 days with chronic use). Dextroamphetamine, diphenhydramine and ketamine can cause false-positive results.​[[21]](#psc1090n1018)
- The maximum time after last use that

  methamphetamine can be detected ranges from 3–4 days, and numerous drugs are associated with false-positive results: amantadine, amphetamine, bupropion, chlorpromazine, desipramine, dextroamphetamine, ephedrine, labetalol, methylamphetamine or ecstasy, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, selegiline and trazodone.​[[21]](#psc1090n1018)
- The maximum time after last use that

  cocaine can be detected is 8 days. Topical anesthetics and coca leaf teas can cause false-positives.​[[21]](#psc1090n1018)
- The maximum time after last use that

  opiates can be detected is 4 days, depending upon the compound ingested. Dextromethorphan, poppy seeds, quinine, quinolone antibiotics and rifampin can cause false-positive results.​[[22]](#psc1090n1019)​[[23]](#psc1090n1020)

Adding products like bleach, alum, oxidizing agents and goldenseal will result in a negative test; however, the test will detect that the urine has been tampered with.​[[24]](#psc1090n1021)​[[25]](#psc1090n1022)

### Alcohol

Alcohol use and intoxication can cause loss of alertness, impairment of judgment, coma and death. It is implicated in automobile accidents and birth defects. After consumption, alcohol is excreted through the liver and kidneys with 1–5% excreted by evaporation through the breath.

Urine and blood laboratory tests are able to determine alcohol levels; however, home tests measure alcohol found in the breath. The breath is exhaled onto a test substrate housed in a tube. A colour change indicates the presence of alcohol, but often not the quantity of alcohol. Some home tests are intended to be carried on a key chain to be used prior to using a car.

Breathalyzer tests used by law enforcement agencies also measure alcohol in the breath. These tests utilize an infrared spectroscopic analysis, which extrapolates the amount of alcohol detected to a blood alcohol level. Alcohol vapour captured in a chamber will absorb a certain wave frequency when light is beamed through it. The more alcohol present, the more light is absorbed (and thus prevented from reaching a receptor). A computer chip translates the receptor information into a blood alcohol level. Breathalyzers used by law enforcement agencies are accurate and can be expensive. Various less-expensive home versions are available using the same technology,​[[26]](#psc1090n1023) but accuracy may vary from product to product.

### Blood Coagulation

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Home Testing Products: Blood Coagulation Monitors.

Home blood coagulation monitors measure prothrombin time (PT) and calculate the International Normalized Ratio (INR).​[[27]](#psc1090n1024) Individuals use home blood coagulation tests in conjunction with a coagulation clinic and/or laboratory testing in order to adjust their own anticoagulant dosage. The variability of INR results has been reported to be 15%; however, this is similar to the variability in laboratory-obtained results​[[28]](#CanadianAgencyForDrugsAndTechnology-04C3F4D6) and these devices are recommended as safe and effective alternatives to laboratory testing.​[[28]](#CanadianAgencyForDrugsAndTechnology-04C3F4D6)​[[29]](#JenningsIKitchenDKeelingDEtAl.Patie-CBE8C439) A systematic review found self-monitoring and self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy led to fewer thromboembolic events and lower mortality and no effects on risk of major bleeding events.​[[30]](#HeneghanCJGarcia-AlaminoJMSpencerEA-CBE81EDE)

These monitors use a whole blood sample applied to a cartridge, where it is drawn by capillary action into a channel coated with dried thromboplastin. When the thromboplastin has been rehydrated by the blood sample, coagulation begins. The mixture will continue to move along the channel until a blood clot forms. A laser photometer detects cessation of flow as a change in light scattering, resulting in a PT measurement that is then used to calculate the INR. Results take about 2 minutes. With INR readings above the therapeutic range, home monitors appear to be less accurate. Home monitoring is not recommended in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, but may be less invasive and better accepted than laboratory procedures in children requiring anticoagulation.

Individuals using home blood coagulation monitors require training, the ongoing support of a coagulation centre and education on using dosage adjustment guidelines. Record-keeping is paramount, as is continuing evaluation of correct technique and accuracy of the monitor. If individuals are considering home coagulation monitoring, it is important that they work with either their family physician and/or a coagulation clinic as well as their pharmacist. The cost of the monitor and testing supplies may limit their use. Some private insurance plans may cover associated costs.​[[28]](#CanadianAgencyForDrugsAndTechnology-04C3F4D6)

### Celiac Disease

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Home Testing Products: Celiac Disease Test Kits.

Celiac disease occurs largely in Caucasians of Northern European ancestry and is an autoimmune disease. Estimated prevalence is 1 in 100 North Americans. With exposure to gliadin and related gluten proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye, the intestinal enzyme transglutaminase modifies the gluten proteins, which in turn trigger the body's immune response. The result is damage to the epithelia and villi of the small intestine, causing the associated symptoms, such as diarrhea, flatulence, weight loss and weakness.

Although present even in childhood, celiac disease may not manifest until the 4​th decade of life or even later. There is a familial tendency and with a diagnosis of celiac disease, it is usually recommended that family members are also tested. Biopsy of the small intestine, genetic testing for a specific HLA-DQ2 gene (which the vast majority of affected people have) and serological testing for specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to transglutaminase are used to diagnose the disease.

A home self-test using ELISA technology is available for detection of the antibody to transglutaminase. The test uses a blood sample and includes a control; however, data on the accuracy of these tests are limited, and they cannot be used to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of celiac disease. Patients with symptoms of celiac disease should consult an appropriate health-care practitioner for a definitive diagnosis and to address potential complications including other related immune diseases.​[[31]](#RashidMButznerJDWarrenREtAl.HomeBlo-CBE99D76) A gluten-free diet is the recommended treatment for celiac disease but should not be started before diagnosis is confirmed by intestinal biopsy (see Special Diets).​[[31]](#RashidMButznerJDWarrenREtAl.HomeBlo-CBE99D76)​[[32]](#psc1090n1025)

### Dip-and-Read Urine Tests

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*— Diabetes Products: Urine Glucose and Ketone Test Kits.

Dip-and-read urine tests are used for a variety of conditions such as pregnancy and fertility (see Pregnancy and Fertility Testing); however, these home diagnostic tests are also used to test for pH, proteins, glucose, ketones and other substances.​[[33]](#psc1090n1026)

Dip-and-read urine tests for protein usually detect albumin, but may not detect other proteins. False-positive results may be caused by excessive exercise, cold exposure, pregnancy, fever, urinary tract infections, diabetes and even changes in posture. If a dip-and-read urine test is positive for protein, medical attention should be sought since there are numerous potential causes including kidney disease, heart disease, certain types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.​[[34]](#psc1090n1027)

Glucose dip-and-read urine tests were used to monitor control of diabetes; however, these have been replaced by blood glucose monitors. Ketones are the result of the breakdown of fat and are detected in poorly controlled diabetes and in some diets, e.g., the Atkins diet.​[[35]](#psc1090n1028)

Urine is usually acidic, with a pH ranging from 4.5–5. Ingestion of proteins or acidic foods can increase the acidity of urine, and dip-and-read pH tests are used to confirm high-dietary protein intake in patients on high-protein diets. Kidney disease, urinary tract infections and vomiting are associated with elevated urinary pH; diabetic ketoacidosis, diarrhea and starvation lead to lower urinary pH.

Dip-and-read urine tests are considered semiquantitative in that the test colour is compared with a colour chart, which represents a range of values.

With dip-and-read urine tests, technique is important:

- Collect urine in a clean sample bottle.
- Wash hands before collecting the sample and clean the genital area.
- Collect a midstream sample—begin urinating into the toilet, pause, then urinate into the sample bottle until a sufficient sample is obtained, and, if needed, finish urinating into the toilet.
- Completely immerse the test area of the dip-and-read urine test in the collected sample.
- Shake off any excess urine and read the test according to the directions.
- If the urine sample is not being used immediately, it should be stored in the refrigerator (for up to 24 hours) and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to testing.

### Fecal Occult Blood Testing

Recommended and reliable diagnostic tests for fecal occult blood (FOB) are not available without a requisition from a qualified health-care practitioner. They are often ordered for people at risk of colorectal cancer: over 50 years of age; personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or colorectal cancer; or family history of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the 3​rd most-common cause of cancer in Canada with a mortality rate as high as 60%.​[[36]](#ColorectalCancerCanada.ScreeningDia-CB8A5DF2) Early detection is vital to improved survival, and proper use of these tests is essential. When feces pass over precancerous or cancerous lesions, bleeding can occur but the amount of blood in the stool is generally insufficient to be noticed visually. FOB tests can detect these minute traces of blood, identifying patients who may need further investigation. However, these tests cannot determine from which portion of the bowel the blood originated, nor can they distinguish between bleeding from cancer versus other bowel conditions such as diverticulosis or inflammatory bowel disease; thus, false-positive results can occur. There are 2 general types of tests that are used in the home to screen for fecal occult blood: guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT). Although the testing is performed by the patient at home, the tests are ordered by a practitioner and interpreted by a laboratory. Other self-testing kits available through internet sites may utilize a reagent-impregnated pad that is dropped into the toilet bowl after a bowel movement and show a colour change when blood is detected.​[[37]](#EZDetectAvailableFromEzdectect.coma-CB8854CA) There is no involvement of a health-care practitioner or laboratory unless the patient seeks further treatment, in which case gFOBT or FIT will likely be ordered to confirm the results. Positive FOBT is usually recommended to be followed up by colonoscopy.

Since patients usually perform these tests at home, the following information may be helpful:​[[38]](#psc1090n1050)​[[39]](#psc1090n1051)​[[40]](#psc1090n1052)

- Keep all tests out of the reach of children.
- A blood loss of 0.5–0.75 mL causes the stool to appear dark red or black and tarry; these tests detect even smaller or occult amounts.
- Fecal occult blood testing can differentiate between blood and other substances causing stool discoloration, such as dietary intake of beets.
- Increased dietary fibre is recommended to encourage any lesions to bleed and improve accuracy of the tests.
- Some physical conditions can affect test results: anal fissures, bleeding gums, diarrhea, diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, menstruation, nosebleed, peptic ulcer disease, proctitis and ulcerative colitis. Testing may need to be postponed until these conditions are managed.
- Read all instructions prior to using any FOBT and follow food and drug restrictions if recommended in the instructions.
- Stool samples are retrieved from the toilet bowl, thus the toilet bowl must be free of chemicals such as toilet bowl cleaners, disinfectants and deodorizers.
- When testing is complete, FOBT are returned to the practitioner or laboratory.

### Fecal Immunochemical Test

A fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (also known as iFOBT) uses antibodies to detect human hemoglobin protein in the stool. This type of test does not use a reagent; thus, there are no food or drug cautions necessary. The test is more sensitive than gFOBT (less likely to react to upper GI bleeding) and only 1 stool sample is required. The sample must be forwarded to the testing laboratory within 2 weeks of taking the 1​st sample(s) and the sample itself should not be mixed with urine. Due to ease of use, there are fewer errors in technique and fewer false-negatives;​[[41]](#MousavinezhadMMajdzadehRAkbariSAEtA-CB875F39) many jurisdictions have moved to using FIT over gFOBT in their screening programs.

### Guaiac Fecal Occult Blood Tests

The guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) uses the chemical guaiac to detect the heme portion of blood. The gFOBT requires patients to take stool samples of 3 consecutive bowel movements, which then are smeared on a test card. The collection should be done over a period of 2 weeks and the sample itself should not be mixed with urine. Some foods and drugs interfere with the test and are generally recommended to be avoided for 3 days prior to and during testing days. Of note:

- >250 mg vitamin C daily from citrus or supplements can cause false-negatives
- Foods with peroxidase activity are thought to interfere with the test (e.g., artichokes, broccoli, radishes [including horseradish], melons, mushrooms, parsnips)
- Animal hemoglobin from meat cooked rare can result in false-positive results
- NSAIDs can cause GI bleeding and false-positive results and are recommended to be avoided for 7 days prior to the test
- Other medications may also interfere with testing: colchicine, corticosteroids, iron, reserpine and warfarin.

While simple and cost effective, gFOBTs are usually considered by patients to be unsanitary and unpleasant.

### Examples of Other Home Diagnostic Tests

Although numerous home diagnostic devices are advertised extensively and available via the internet (see [Table 1](#psc1090n00023)), many more sensitive and specific tests are available through health-care practitioners at little or no cost, e.g., a laboratory “cholesterol test” measures a complete lipid panel at no expense to the patient.

Before purchase of a home diagnostic test, the following should be considered:

- The diagnosis or measurement should be relevant to overall health, e.g., the pH of urine may have no affect on health.
- The measurement should provide useful information, e.g., elevated FSH levels are not diagnostic of menopause; elevated PSA levels are not diagnostic of prostate cancer.
- The testing kit should be appropriate for home use, e.g., home cholesterol tests may be misinterpreted.
- Bogus, contaminated and counterfeit home diagnostic devices do exist and should be avoided. Health-care practitioners, the Consumers Union and Health Canada provide information about home testing and recalls of kits.
- Some home diagnostic tests are performed entirely at home; others are collection kits with collected samples mailed to a testing laboratory, sometimes located in the United States. Attention should be paid to the location of the testing laboratory because collected samples may degrade in transit. Confidentiality should be assured for any collected samples sent to a testing laboratory.
- A good understanding of how to interpret or act on the results of a home diagnostic test is essential for safe use.
- Home diagnostic tests that could be potentially dangerous should be avoided, e.g., allergy testing, in which a potential allergen is used.
- Simpler, more straightforward alternatives may be available, e.g., using plastic wrap for skin cancer test kits rather than the transparent sheet that is provided in the kit (see [Table 1](#psc1090n00023)).
- Home testing for infections should always be performed in conjunction with appropriate medical attention.​[[42]](#psc1090n1030)

With time, technological changes may make some of these home tests more viable.

An evolving area of home testing is the use of apps for computers and mobile phones. Mental-health assessments, diabetes monitoring, exercise activity, weight loss and food intake are some examples. As with all home tests, these home testing apps do not replace care provided by health-care practitioners.

**Table 1:** Additional Home Diagnostic Tests

| Home Diagnostic Test | Mechanism | Comments​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allergy testing​ [43] | Uses a challenge with a substance that could potentially cause an allergy. | Allergy testing needs to be performed with medical supervision in the event that an allergic reaction results. |
| Alzheimer disease​ [44] ​ [45] | Uses a scent challenge with various odours; in some cases, changes in smell sensation is indicative of Alzheimer disease. | Other causes of changes in smell sensation can cause false-positives, e.g., nasal congestion or a subjective test; an alternative is the Mini Mental Test. |
| An online questionnaire. | May not be indicative of Alzheimer disease because of confounding due to inexperience with online questionnaire completion, low language and/or educational skills, other mental health concerns including fatigue |
| Helicobacter pylori ​ [46] | A test for the gram-negative bacterium responsible for peptic ulcer disease; an immunochromatographic assay for antibodies to the bacteria using a blood sample and ELISA technology. | Fails to identify whether the infection is current since antibodies may persist for 6 or more months; false-negatives occur when antibody levels are low. |
| Hepatitis​ [47] | A test for antibodies to the virus; different assays are able to identify different viruses, e.g., A, B, C. | Uses a blood sample; must be mailed to a testing laboratory, usually located in the United States. |
| Human immunodeficiency virus​ [48] |  | No home testing kits are approved for sale in Canada; however, they may be ordered online or purchased in other countries. |
| Human papilloma virus (HPV) | Tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea as well as HPV. | Uses a vaginal sample which is mailed to a testing laboratory; patient views results on secure website.​ [49] May increase screening for STIs among underserviced women e.g., those living in remote areas, postmenopausal women, newcomers to Canada.​ [50] |
| Influenza​ [51] | A nasal swab used in a 3-step procedure to detect antigens to influenza A and B. | Appropriate medical consultation is preferred. |
| Male fertility​ [52] ​ [53] | A test for quantity of sperm. | Uses a reagent mixed with a semen sample applied to a test stick. Test performed and read at home by the patient. |
| A test for DHEA and/or testosterone. | Uses a saliva sample. |
| Metabolic hormones, e.g., cortisol, thyroid​ [54] | A test for 1 or more metabolic hormones depending upon the testing capacity of the kit purchased. | Uses a saliva sample. |
| Prostate cancer​ [55] ​ [56] | A test for prostate specific antigen (PSA), which is elevated in prostate cancer. | Uses a blood sample for in-home detection; benign prostate hyperplasia, prostatitis, autoimmune disease or sexual activity within 48 h of testing may produce false-positives; some rapidly growing tumours do not elevate PSA levels. |
| Skin cancer​ [57] | A test for changes in appearance of skin growths. | Uses a transparent sheet that is placed on the skin and any growths are traced; changes over time are noted. |
| Streptococcal infections​ [58] | A throat swab is tested using ELISA technology for bacterial antigens. Throat and ear examination kits with fully illustrated guide books. | Both are difficult to use with uncooperative children. |
| Tobacco use​ [59] | A test for nicotine or cotinine, a nicotine metabolite; cotinine can be detected up to 4 days after tobacco has been used. | Uses a saliva or urine sample for in-home testing; testing of a hair sample provides results of up to 90 days after tobacco has been used; however, the hair sample must be mailed to a testing laboratory, usually located in the United States. |
| Urinary tract infections​ [60] | A urine dip test for nitrites produced by gram-negative bacteria from nitrates, or for leukocyte esterase, indicating the presence of leukocytes in the urine. | False-negative results may be caused by vegetarian diets, tetracycline or a high intake of vitamin C. |
| Vaginal infections​ [61] | A test strip worn as a “panty liner,” which detects the pH of vaginal secretions by a colour change. | Normal pH of vaginal secretions is 4–4.5; bacterial and trichomonas infections raise the pH to 5–6: inaccurate results occur with sweating, during menstruation, less than 1 day before or 5 days after a menstrual period, within 48 h of intercourse or douching, with menopause, and within 72 h of applying a vaginal product such as a contraceptive cream. |

[a] Availability of these tests may vary; most are not available for direct purchase in Canada and must be obtained and/or analyzed via laboratories in the United States.

### Potential Home Diagnostic Testing Problems

Many home tests focus on health conditions that are represented by national health organizations, e.g., the Canadian Diabetes Association. These organizations may have information and/or guidelines regarding the test, including the accuracy and appropriateness of use. Human error is the primary reason for failure or erroneous results when home testing.

Care in preparing, administering and interpreting results is needed:

- Note the accuracy of the test as well as the substance for which the test is designed, e.g., cholesterol tests measure only total cholesterol and do not provide a lipid profile.
- Read all directions and identify all test components prior to testing.
- Check the kit expiry date; do not use an expired test kit.
- A clean, undisturbed, well-lit area is ideal for testing; test surfaces should not be touched and hands should be washed prior to testing to reduce potential contamination.
- If the test equipment or monitor uses batteries, make sure they are charged.
- Directions for sample collection, including the best time of day for collection, should be followed carefully and any timing should be done accurately with a timer, watch or clock with a minute hand.
- If the test uses a control and it fails, results are invalid and should not be used.
- Interpretation of the results is essential, e.g., the meaning of a positive or negative result, and when to seek medical attention.
- The calibration of monitors should be checked on a routine basis.
- If testing is ongoing (e.g., blood pressure), keep a log or diary.
- If the subject resists the test procedure (e.g., taking a blood or urine sample or a throat swab), the sample may not be adequate and the result may be inaccurate.
- The required manual dexterity and eyesight is also essential.
- Human error can occur at each step of a test; tests with fewer steps have less potential for human error.
- Many manufacturers have toll-free telephone numbers and websites that are useful resources.
- Home diagnostic tests offered via the internet may not be recognized as accurate, may not be approved for use in Canada or may require sending a sample to a central laboratory in a manner that degrades the sample.
