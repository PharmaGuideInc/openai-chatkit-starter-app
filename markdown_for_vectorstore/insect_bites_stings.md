### Pathophysiology

Arachnids and insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda (invertebrate animals with exoskeletons, multisegmented bodies, and paired, jointed appendages). Arachnids discussed in this chapter include ticks and spiders. Insects discussed in this chapter include mosquitoes, bees and wasps, and bed bugs. These arachnids and insects may bite (spiders, ticks, mosquitoes, bed bugs) or sting (bees and wasps).​[[1]](#PowersJMcDowellRH.InsectBites.StatP-921D06A2) Lice and scabies are discussed in Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies.

The most common injury when coming into contact with arachnids and insects is a localized, self-limited skin reaction, commonly including raised papules or urticaria. Occasionally, serious sequelae can result from systemic effects of envenomation and include significant allergic reactions, or transmission of disease if the arthropod is a vector. Deaths from arachnid or insect exposures are rare and usually result from anaphylaxis.​[[1]](#PowersJMcDowellRH.InsectBites.StatP-921D06A2)

### Ticks

In Canada, climate change has contributed to an increase in number, type and range of ticks, and consequently, tick-borne diseases. Warmer temperatures lead to improved conditions for tick survival and reproduction and a longer time period each year during which people, pets, livestock and wildlife may be exposed to ticks. The tick season extends from snow melt to snowfall (temperatures above freezing). ​[[2]](#BouchardCDibernardoAKoffiJEtAl.Incr-9234E832)

Ticks sense body heat and vibrations and must climb onto their host, as they are unable to fly. Although ticks can attach to any part of the body, they often crawl to warmer areas (e.g., groin, armpit, scalp), making them difficult to spot. Ticks use specialized mouth parts to cut the skin surface and feed on the blood of the host for several days until the tick is fully engorged and drops off.​[[3]](#psc1172n1005)​[[4]](#GovernmentOfCanada.LymeDiseaseForHe-97DCF278)​[[5]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-9866FD8E)​[[6]](#HoBMDavisHEForresterJD.WildernessMe-98674313) Tick bites do not cause pain to the host at the time of attachment, but may cause a hypersensitivity reaction, including minor swelling, itching or inflammation, at the site within 24 hours of the bite. This reaction is <5 cm in diameter, does not expand over time and subsides within 1–2 days.​[[3]](#psc1172n1005)​[[4]](#GovernmentOfCanada.LymeDiseaseForHe-97DCF278)

### Tick-borne diseases

Some ticks in Canada carry infections that may be transmitted to humans through a tick bite. Consider tick-borne infections in the differential diagnosis in any patient with nonspecific febrile illness of unknown origin, particularly during the warmer months when ticks are most active.​[[7]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-97CA77B6) Many patients with tick-borne disease are unaware that they were bitten by a tick.

### Lyme disease

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in Canada. Ixodes scapularis (known as the black-legged tick or deer tick) and Ixodes pacificus (known as the Western black-legged tick) are the species best known to carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Ticks become infected with B. burgdorferi by feeding on wild animal hosts such as deer, rodents and birds.​[[8]](#PublicHealthAgencyOfCanada.LymeDise-97E54B47)

Lyme disease cases are increasing in Canada. Health Canada monitors areas of concern and maintains a [webpage](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/surveillance-lyme-disease.html#a4) with this information .

Ticks must be attached to the skin for at least 24 hours to transmit B. burgdorferi.​[[8]](#PublicHealthAgencyOfCanada.LymeDise-97E54B47)​[[9]](#CentreForEffectivePractice.EarlyLym-E4967C02)

Information on the stages of Lyme disease can be found in [Table 1](#StagesOfLymeDisease-98486689).

See [Prevention](#psc1172n00012) for information on prevention measures and prophylaxis for Lyme disease after a high-risk tick bite.

Treatment of Lyme disease involves use of antibiotics (doxycyline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone). Choice of antibiotic, route, dosage and duration is dependent on the clinical syndrome at presentation.​[[10]](#Viel-TheriaultILeSauxN.LymeDiseasei-98532BF2) See Lyme Disease for a comprehensive discussion of diagnosis, prevention and treatment.

**Table 1:** Stages of Lyme Disease​[[4]](#GovernmentOfCanada.LymeDiseaseForHe-97DCF278)[[8]](#PublicHealthAgencyOfCanada.LymeDise-97E54B47)[[10]](#Viel-TheriaultILeSauxN.LymeDiseasei-98532BF2)[[11]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-97E702BD)

| Stage | Time Period After Bite | Symptoms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early localized | 3–30 days | Most people (70–80%) who contract Lyme disease will present with a rash called erythema migrans (EM) within 3–30 days after the tick bite that may persist for up to 8 wk . Because EM does not usually feel itchy or cause pain, it may go unnoticed if it occurs on an area of the body that is hard to see. EM typically presents as a flat circular or oval area, classic “bull’s eye” or “target” appearance (concentric circles with clear area in between) is thought to occur in <50 % of patients. The rash often remains a uniform colour without an outer ring. Occasionally there may be a blistering or crusting centre. The area may feel warm to the touch The colour of the rash depends on the patient’s skin colour: it may appear pink/red or red/blue on lightly pigmented skin and bluish-purple, bruise-like or as hyperpigmention on darkly pigmented skin, which may be difficult to see The rash gradually expands outwards from the bite area to >5 cm (up to 30 cm) EM can be differentiated from a hypersensitivity reaction to the tick bite itself by the fact that the latter will develop within 24 hours , remain <5 cm in diameter and subside over 1–2 days 20–30% of patients with Lyme disease will not develop EM Low-grade fever, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache and swollen lymph nodes can occur with or without the rash |
| Early disseminated | 1–3 months (if early localized is not treated) | Untreated infection spreads via the circulation resulting in end-organ involvement. Possible manifestations include: General: fatigue and general weakness Skin: multiple EM lesions (typically smaller than localized EM) that may fade and reappear in different locations; other rashes, vaginal ulcers Musculoskeletal: brief episodes of arthritis, migratory pain Neurological: aseptic meningitis, cranial neuropathy, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, subtle encephalopathy, pseudotumor cerebri, mononeuritis multiplex, radiculopathy, subtle cognitive difficulties Cardiac: AV block, sinus node dysfunction, intra-atrial block, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myopericarditis Ocular: conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis or panophthalmitis Others: mild hepatitis splenomegaly |
| Late | >3 months (if not treated at an earlier stage) | Absent or ineffective treatment at earlier stages can lead to late disease manifestations, commonly involving the musculoskeletal or nervous system. Since these can be hard to distinguish from other chronic inflammatory disorders, a high index of suspicion for Lyme is required. |

### Emerging tick-borne diseases

In addition to Lyme disease, other tick-borne diseases are emerging in Canada. See [Table 2](#EmergingTick-borneDiseasesInCanada-954F3950).

**Table 2:** Emerging Tick-Borne Diseases in Canada​[[2]](#BouchardCDibernardoAKoffiJEtAl.Incr-9234E832)[[12]](#NationalCollaboratingCentreForInfec-95C8A4DA)[[13]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-95CC0922)[[14]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-97C9F96D)[[15]](#YangJSmithCBattadA.BabesiaMicrotiAc-9868A2EE)[[16]](#NationalCollaboratingCentreForInfec-95C72BBA)[[17]](#GovernmentOfCanada.PowassanVirusDis-95C84B9A)[[18]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-97CA2837)[[19]](#Madison-AntenucciSKramerLDGebhardtL-98686885)

| Disease | Tick Vectors | Characteristics | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anaplasmosis (caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ) | Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick, deer tick) Ixodes pacificus (western black-legged tick) | Tick must stay attached for 24–48 h to transmit the bacterium Onset of symptoms: 7–14 days after tick bite Most cases are mild or moderate and may include fever, chills, malaise, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia Severe complications occur rarely and include septic shock and respiratory, heart, kidney, and neurologic problems | Difficult to distinguish from Lyme disease by symptoms; however, treatment is the same for both conditions (see Lyme disease ), generally for 10–14 days . Prompt treatment can reduce the risk of developing severe illness. |
| Babesiosis (caused by the protozoal parasite Babesia microti ) | I. scapularis (black-legged tick, deer tick) | Tick must stay attached for 36–48 h to transmit the parasite Onset of symptoms ranges from <1 wk to many months after tick bite Infects red blood cells; common symptoms include fever, chills, sweats, myalgia, anorexia Some patients will show signs of anemia such as pallor and jaundice | Confirmed cases treated with both an antibiotic and an antiparasitic. |
| Powassan virus disease | Most commonly: I. scapularis (black-legged tick, deer tick) Less commonly : Ixodes cookei (groundhog/woodchuck tick) Ixodes marxi (squirrel tick) | Virus can be transmitted within 15–30 minutes of tick attachment Onset of symptoms usually within 7–30 days after tick bite Most people are asymptomatic or have mild, flulike symptoms; however, more serious symptoms can occur, including encephalitis, which has a 10% fatality rate. Long-term neurologic issues can occur | Current prevalence in Canada is low but diagnosis should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms similar to encephalitis. Treatment is supportive care. |
| Borrelia miyamotoi disease | I. scapularis (black-legged tick, deer tick) I. pacificus (western black-legged tick) | Bacterium can be transmitted within the first 24 h of tick attachment Onset of symptoms days to weeks after tick bite Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia; rash is uncommon | Case series indicate successful treatment with antibiotic regimens used in Lyme disease.​ [18] |

Additional tick-borne diseases that are still rare in Canada but could possibly begin to emerge with climate change include those transmitted by Dermacentor spp. ticks: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado tick fever and those transmitted by Amblyomma americanum (the Lone Star tick): tularemia, Southern tick–associated rash illness and Ehrlichiosis.​[[2]](#BouchardCDibernardoAKoffiJEtAl.Incr-9234E832)​[[7]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-97CA77B6)

### Mosquitoes

The female mosquito inserts the tip of her mouth into a small blood vessel near the surface of the skin and then injects salivary secretions that commonly cause local histamine reactions (inflammation, swelling, intense itchiness). The itchy papules develop within minutes of a bite and may appear as red spots on lighter skin or dark spots or like a bruise on darker skin. They subside slowly over a few days. Some people may develop antibodies that contribute to formation of large welts that last for several days. Anaphylaxis is rare. Bites may become infected from scratching.​[[20]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-98C9FDB1) Rarely, a person may develop “skeeter syndrome,” a large (up to 10 cm) local allergic reaction to mosquito saliva that is itchy, inflamed, warm, swollen and hard. Fever may be present and it can be difficult to differentiate this reaction from infection.​[[21]](#AmericanAcademyOfAllergyAsthmaAndIm-E4A15631)​[[22]](#AmrM.El-SayedAbdel-MotagalyHanaaMah-E4A158DE)

A number of viral and parasitic diseases (e.g., malaria, Zika virus, Dengue) can be carried by infected mosquitoes around the world with the most relevant in Canada being West Nile virus (see also Information for the Traveller). The Public Health Agency of Canada closely monitors and reports on West Nile virus, particularly in peak times from May to October. West Nile virus infection has been reported in all provinces in Canada except Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI. West Nile virus can be transmitted to humans via the bite of a mosquito that has previously fed on an infected bird. The virus can also be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ/tissue transplants. There is evidence that pregnant patients can pass the virus to their unborn child. Transmission may also be through breast milk, though level of risk is unknown. The virus is not known to be transmitted by touching or kissing between people or between people and animals. There has been no known person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission reported.​[[23]](#InfectionPreventionControlCanada.We-98CAE5E9)​[[24]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-98CB14D1)

Many people infected with West Nile virus do not become sick. Symptoms usually appear within 2–15 days of being infected. Mild cases may present with fever, body aches, headache, rash or swollen lymph glands. Symptoms of more severe illness can include the sudden onset of headache, high fever, stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, vision loss and muscle weakness. Elderly, immunocompromised or chronically ill persons have an increased risk of becoming severely ill after being infected. There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. Patients with severe symptoms are managed with supportive therapy.​[[20]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-98C9FDB1)

Preventive measures (see [Prevention](#psc1172n00012)) are especially important in areas of high risk and for those at risk of developing severe illness.

### Bees and Wasps

Stinging insects of the order *Hymenoptera* are known to cause the majority of severe insect-related reactions. There are 3 families of insects known to cause a reaction: bees (bumblebees, honeybees), wasps/vespids (including yellow jackets and hornets) and stinging ants (fire ants).​[[25]](#QuanD.NorthAmericanPoisonousBitesAn-922C5F65)​[[26]](#BoburkaSM.ReducingTheStingDiagnosis-995208F4)

Honeybees and bumblebees rarely sting unless they are provoked or protecting their nests. Honeybees are able to sting only once as their stinger is barbed and remains embedded in the skin, whereas wasps are able to sting multiple times. The venom of bees and wasps contains multiple protein allergens, which lead to a severe reaction in those who are susceptible.​[[27]](#LunHonKLeungAKC.BeeOrWaspSting.Woun-B93D089F)​[[28]](#PansareMSethDKamatAEtAl.SummerBuzzA-99540F05)

The most common reaction to a sting from a hymenoptera insect is a local reaction (pain, inflammation and swelling at the site of the sting) beginning within minutes of the sting and resolving within a few hours.​[[26]](#BoburkaSM.ReducingTheStingDiagnosis-995208F4)​[[29]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianCentreFo-9955C405) Occasionally there may be a large local reaction that includes swelling over a large area (>10 cm in diameter) with itching and pain that peaks at 24–48 hours after the bite and subsides over 3–10 days.​[[26]](#BoburkaSM.ReducingTheStingDiagnosis-995208F4)​[[28]](#PansareMSethDKamatAEtAl.SummerBuzzA-99540F05)

The most serious reaction to bee or wasp stings is anaphylaxis, which can occur within minutes or up to several hours after the initial sting (see [Emergency Treatment](#psc1172n00020)).​[[26]](#BoburkaSM.ReducingTheStingDiagnosis-995208F4)​[[28]](#PansareMSethDKamatAEtAl.SummerBuzzA-99540F05)​[[29]](#GovernmentOfCanada.CanadianCentreFo-9955C405)

### Bed Bugs

Infestations of bed bugs are increasing due to increased travel, resistance to insecticide products and ineffective pest control practices. Detecting bed bugs can be difficult. Suggested methods include close inspection of areas where bed bugs hide during daylight hours (e.g., seams of mattresses, crevices in box springs or walls, luggage, electric outlets or switch plates, bedclothes, furniture) for dark or rusty fecal spots, egg shells and shed exoskeletons, inspection of bedding for small blood stains and inspection of skin for lesions due to bites, see: [Photo 3](#psc1172n01072). Commercial bed bug traps are available and can help confirm the presence of an infestation.​[[30]](#ParolaPArezkiI.Bedbugs.NEnglJMed202-98D8C44D)

Bed bugs are red-brown, oval-shaped insects that are attracted to humans and animals by warmth and carbon dioxide, see [Photo 2](#psc1172n01071). They feed on their host every 3–7 days by inserting a sharp proboscis through the skin to withdraw blood. They can live from several weeks up to 18 months without feeding. They cannot fly or jump but can be easily moved from one location to another on an infested object. They generally feed just before dawn and hide during the daylight hours.​[[30]](#ParolaPArezkiI.Bedbugs.NEnglJMed202-98D8C44D)​[[31]](#EnnisACPearson-ShaverAL.BedbugBites-98D86526)​[[32]](#KamathSKenner-BellB.InfestationsBit-98D89BFA)​[[33]](#GovernmentOfCanada.Bedbugs-whatAreT-98EB148A)

Bed bug bites are painless and may present as raised, inflamed, itchy lesions that can appear within a few days or up to 14 days after a bite. Severity of the reaction varies from person to person, ranging from none to pronounced.​[[33]](#GovernmentOfCanada.Bedbugs-whatAreT-98EB148A)​[[34]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-E4A53637) They are commonly found on the parts of the body that are not covered by pyjamas during the night (e.g., face, neck, arms and legs). Bites typically appear in clusters of 3 (breakfast, lunch and dinner) or more in a line, curve or zigzag pattern.​[[30]](#ParolaPArezkiI.Bedbugs.NEnglJMed202-98D8C44D)​[[31]](#EnnisACPearson-ShaverAL.BedbugBites-98D86526)​[[32]](#KamathSKenner-BellB.InfestationsBit-98D89BFA)

Bed bugs are not known to carry diseases, but in rare cases have led to a severe allergic reaction or anemia.​[[31]](#EnnisACPearson-ShaverAL.BedbugBites-98D86526) Monitor for signs of infection due to scratching, sleep disturbances due to itch and psychological issues that can occur from living with bed bugs (anxiety, hypervigilance, phobias).​[[31]](#EnnisACPearson-ShaverAL.BedbugBites-98D86526)​[[32]](#KamathSKenner-BellB.InfestationsBit-98D89BFA)

Because eradication of bed bugs can be very difficult, prevention is extremely important, see [Prevention](#psc1172n00012). Health Canada strongly recommends hiring a licensed professional pest control operator to deal with a bed bug infestation, as the use of unregistered pesticides and other methods such as ozone generators have resulted in severe injury and death.​[[33]](#GovernmentOfCanada.Bedbugs-whatAreT-98EB148A)​[[35]](#GovernmentOfCanada.HealthCanadaWarn-9951ABE5) Undertaking physical control methods such as steaming, washing, freezing, vacuuming and discarding infested items as appropriate as well taking steps to prevent reinfestation are also key parts of successful eradication. Detailed information about physical control and prevention methods can be found on the [Health Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/pest-control-tips/bedbugs-how-do-i-get-rid-them.html).

### Spiders

The most common types of spiders in Canada (e.g., wolf, cellar, house, fishing) rarely bite humans unless they feel threatened. Their venom causes only mild redness or swelling. They do not cause disease and are not considered a threat to humans.​[[25]](#QuanD.NorthAmericanPoisonousBitesAn-922C5F65)​[[36]](#KernerDDeSimoneEMDavidianMH.Prevent-B117CE44)​[[37]](#GovernmentOfCanada.PestControlTipsS-92274946)

Spiders in the black widow family (*Latrodectus* species) are much less common in Canada, but can be found in the southernmost parts of Canada from British Columbia east to Ontario, with the largest population being found in Ontario. They are also found across the continental U.S.​[[38]](#NatureConservancyCanada.InsectsAndS-9229E712) Black widow species tend to live in dark places (crawl spaces, woodpiles, basements) and usually bite only to protect themselves or their nests. The bite feels like a sharp sting that becomes numb initially followed by becoming painful at the bite site. Within 30–60 minutes, the skin may become inflamed and appear red in lightly pigmented skin or have a purple, brown or grey hue in darkly pigmented skin. Severe symptoms can arise within 1–6 hours and may include sweating, nausea, restlessness, muscle spasms, and pain in the lower back or stomach. Treatment is symptomatic and includes washing the bite area, applying ice to any swelling and managing pain.​[[25]](#QuanD.NorthAmericanPoisonousBitesAn-922C5F65) Refer to an appropriate health-care provider if experiencing severe symptoms.

The brown recluse spider is not usually found in Canada but is native to the south and central U.S. They like to inhabit dark areas such as woodpiles. The bite feels like a sharp sting and can cause inflammation and itching at the bite site as well as mild to intense pain. Within 24–48 hours, the area can blister and bleed. Enzymes in the venom cause tissue destruction/necrosis, which produces an open sore a week or more after the bite. This may take months to heal.​[[39]](#MyHealth.Alberta.caBrownRecluseSpid-92314987)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent bites and stings
- Provide symptomatic relief for localized reactions
- Prevent diseases or reactions caused by bites and stings
- Ensure patient receives appropriate care when warranted in the case of more serious reactions

### Patient Assessment

Self-management is appropriate for most arachnid and insect bites or stings in Canada because self-limiting localized skin reactions (itching, inflammation and swelling at the bite site) are the most common consequence. Mild allergic reactions (hives, rash and mild swelling at the bite site) can also be self-treated.​[[40]](#psc1172n01078) Patients require further medical treatment if they experience large local reactions (swelling beyond the bite site), multiple stings or an anaphylactic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of throat, large areas of swelling or fainting). Suspected anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment and follow-up medical care. See [Emergency Treatment](#psc1172n00020). An assessment plan for patients with arachnid and insect bites and stings is presented in [Figure 1](#psc1172n00010).

### Prevention

See [Table 3](#PreventionOfInsectBitesAndStings-9965DD9C) and [Table 4](#psc1172n00014) for information on the prevention of arachnid and insect bites and stings.

**Table 3:** Prevention of Arachnid and Insect Bites and Stings

| Arachnid/Insect | Preventive Measures |
| --- | --- |
| Ticks ​ [3] ​ [6] ​ [9] ​ [41] ​ [42] | Preventing bites: See Insect Repellents Avoid walking through grassy areas, remain in the middle of pathways Clear away leaf debris Ensure pants and shirts are tight at the ankles and wrists or tucked into socks or gloves Wear light-coloured clothes to more easily see ticks Inspect clothing before returning indoors; once inside, remove clothing and check the whole body, especially tick-prone areas such as ankle, wrist and neck and then shower within 2 hours Inspect pets before returning indoors Preventing tick-borne diseases if bitten: Remove any attached ticks as soon as they are discovered: grasp the head with tweezers or a tick-removal tool as close to your skin as possible, slowly pull straight up (no twisting or angles) to ensure removal of the mouth parts that are embedded in the skin; dispose of tick safely Prompt removal will lessen the severity of any local reaction to a tick bite and reduce the chances of disease transmission See below for information on postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis of Lyme disease Criteria for Postexposure Antibiotic Prophylaxis of Lyme Disease Give prophylaxis within 72 h of tick bite if all 3 of the following criteria are met: Local rate of B. burgdorferi infection in ticks is >20% Tick is identified as Ixodes species (black-legged tick/deer tick or Western black-legged tick) Tick was attached for at least 24 h (an engorged tick has likely been attached for >24 h) Adult Single dose doxycycline 200 mg (may be given during pregnancy and breastfeeding​ [a] ) Child Single dose doxycycline 4.4 mg/kg (up to 200 mg) [a] The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada suggests that doxycycline may be considered for postexposure prophylaxis if the pregnant or breastfeeding individual meets the 3 criteria listed and after discussion of risks versus benefits with the individual. | Criteria for Postexposure Antibiotic Prophylaxis of Lyme Disease Give prophylaxis within 72 h of tick bite if all 3 of the following criteria are met: Local rate of B. burgdorferi infection in ticks is >20% Tick is identified as Ixodes species (black-legged tick/deer tick or Western black-legged tick) Tick was attached for at least 24 h (an engorged tick has likely been attached for >24 h) | Adult | Single dose doxycycline 200 mg (may be given during pregnancy and breastfeeding​ [a] ) | Child | Single dose doxycycline 4.4 mg/kg (up to 200 mg) |

### Insect Repellents

Insect repellents are chemicals used to discourage insects and/or arachnids from landing or climbing onto the surface on which the repellent has been applied. Insect repellents can be chemicals intended for application to the skin or clothing (DEET, icaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, oil of citronella, soybean oil) or insecticides intended for application only to clothing, hats, or other surfaces, not directly to the skin (metofluthrin, permethrin).

Insect repellents safe for use on the skin can deter biting insects or arachnids such as mosquitoes and ticks. Although some of these insect repellents may also repel spiders, bees and wasps, they are generally not recommended, as these arthropods do not bite or sting humans unless threatened and are not vectors for illness. While some insect repellents may also repel bed bugs, recommended protocols for prevention and eradication of bed bug infestations can be complicated and do not include the use of repellents​[[43]](#GovernmentOfCanada.BedbugsHowDoIGet-B8C3C266) as they may not be practical or effective in this context. Insect repellents should be applied directly to clothing and exposed skin, preferably outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. The repellent should not be applied directly to the face (apply to the hands and then use hands to apply to face) nor sprayed into or near the eyes or mouth (rinse immediately with water if this occurs). Avoid application to the hands of children who may then inadvertently transfer it to their eyes or mouth. Wash the application area with soap and water after returning indoors.​[[44]](#GovernmentOfCanada.PersonalInsectRe-AA4784BB)​[[45]](#TheMedicalLetter.InsectRepellents.i-AA47DD24) Repellent activity and duration of effect are highly variable, depending on the chemical and its concentration, the individual’s activity level, the environment, and the insect or arachnid.

Insecticides used as insect repellents provide an additional measure of protection against ticks and mosquitoes when used in combination with topical insect repellents. Those available in Canada for consumer use contain synthetic pyrethroids, which are toxic to all insects and arachnids on contact and therefore may also afford some protection against bees/wasps and spiders.

See [Table 4](#psc1172n00014) for more information on insect repellents.

Toxic to all insects and arachnids, but product marketed for mosquitoes only. | Concentration: 31.2% Estimated protection time: 12 h per disk | Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Avoid breathing the vapour. | No age restriction on use. Available as a clip-on device; children should not be allowed to handle the device. No information available on safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. |
| Permethrin | A synthetic pyrethroid-based insecticide that kills or incapacitates insects and arachnids on contact. Impregnated clothing protects the covered area by irritating/incapacitating/killing the insect when it lands on the treated fabric, causing it to leave the area or die without biting. Effective against mosquitoes, ticks, bees and wasps, bed bugs, spiders (and virtually all insects). | Commercially produced impregnated clothing is available Available as a 0.5% spray for consumers to treat their own clothing (not approved for sale in Canada) Recommended to be used in combination with topical insect repellent that can be applied to skin (e.g., DEET, icaridin) for more complete protection | Impregnated clothing: testing has not shown any evidence of immediate or long–term concerns. | Approved for those over 16 years of age only; however, adults wearing the clothing may touch or hug children. Considered safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Avoid infants coming into contact with treated clothing while nursing. Wash separately from other clothing. |

[a] Although ticks and spiders are technically arachnids and not insects, the term “insect repellents” is used here, as this is the description generally applied to the chemicals listed in this table.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

### General Measures

For all types of bites and stings, recommend washing the area with soap and water to reduce irritation and risk of infection at the bite site and the application of an ice pack to reduce local pain, itch and inflammation.​[[1]](#PowersJMcDowellRH.InsectBites.StatP-921D06A2)

### Specific Measures

In addition to the general measures above, the following can be implemented:

- Honeybees: remove the barbed stinger embedded in the skin by scraping with a clean, hard object (e.g., credit card, fingernail) as soon as possible to stop continued injection of venom into the wound (bumblebees and wasps do not leave stingers in the skin).​[[26]](#BoburkaSM.ReducingTheStingDiagnosis-995208F4)​[[27]](#LunHonKLeungAKC.BeeOrWaspSting.Woun-B93D089F)
- Ticks: remove ticks as soon as they are discovered by grasping them as close as possible to where the head contacts the skin with tweezers or a tick-removing tool and pulling upwards slowly. Avoid twisting or pulling out too quickly, as this could cause the head to break off and remain in the skin. Cleanse with soap and water after the tick has been completely removed. Anecdotal methods of tick removal including the application of petroleum jelly, nail polish or nail polish remover, or essential oils have no proven efficacy and may cause further irritation or possibly infection by causing the tick to release its stomach contents.​[[3]](#psc1172n1005)​[[6]](#HoBMDavisHEForresterJD.WildernessMe-98674313)​[[4]](#GovernmentOfCanada.LymeDiseaseForHe-97DCF278)
- Brown recluse spider: application of ice decreases the temperature-dependent activity of the enzymes in the venom, limiting tissue necrosis. Immobilize and elevate the area above the heart if the bite occurred on a limb.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Self-treatment of arachnid and insect bites and stings includes relief of pain, swelling and itching using the pharmacologic choices described below.

- Oral analgesics, acetaminophen or NSAIDs can be helpful for associated pain.​[[52]](#KrinskyDL.InPharmacyTodayInsectBite-AA5F9AFD)​[[53]](#PadoveseVDassoniFZouboulisCC.Insect-AA609C5A)
- Non-sedating oral antihistamines (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine) are effective for relieving mild to moderate itching. First-generation antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) are also effective but cause more sedation and have a shorter duration of action.​[[52]](#KrinskyDL.InPharmacyTodayInsectBite-AA5F9AFD)​[[53]](#PadoveseVDassoniFZouboulisCC.Insect-AA609C5A)​[[54]](#JaquaEEHannaMLeeH.HowToIdentifyAndT-AA60DAC4)​[[55]](#FostiniACGolpanianRSRosenJDEtAl.Bea-AA61556F)​[[56]](#KaneN.UnderstandingUrticariainterne-AA619FF7) See Allergic Rhinitis for more information on antihistamines.
- Topical diphenhydramine is not recommended, as it can cause allergic contact dermatitis and sensitization.​[[55]](#FostiniACGolpanianRSRosenJDEtAl.Bea-AA61556F)​[[56]](#KaneN.UnderstandingUrticariainterne-AA619FF7)
- Topical local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine, lidocaine, pramoxine), astringents (e.g., calamine, zinc oxide), counterirritants (e.g., camphor, menthol) or **ammonia/baking soda** combinations (e.g., Afterbite) may provide temporary relief, but evidence of effectiveness or comparative efficacy among these products is lacking.​[[52]](#KrinskyDL.InPharmacyTodayInsectBite-AA5F9AFD) Apply as recommended (see [Table 6](#d2e1537)) for no longer than 7 days or until the symptoms subside.​[[52]](#KrinskyDL.InPharmacyTodayInsectBite-AA5F9AFD)
- Topical corticosteroids

  can be used for 5–7 days to relieve itch, swelling and irritation in mild to moderate local reactions. See [Table 6](#d2e1537).
- Oral prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 60 mg) for 3 to 5 days may be required for large local reactions after assessment by an appropriate health-care provider.​[[56]](#KaneN.UnderstandingUrticariainterne-AA619FF7)​[[57]](#EvansTElstonDM.WhatsEatingYouVespid-AA6E2C8B)​[[58]](#PrzybiliaBRueffF.InsectStings.Dtsch-B1997559)
- Ensure tetanus immunizations are up to date. Arachnid and insect bites, particularly those where a significant lesion develops or necrotic tissue is present (e.g., brown recluse spider), are considered a risk factor for tetanus.​[[1]](#PowersJMcDowellRH.InsectBites.StatP-921D06A2)​[[59]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-B28F0EB3)

### Emergency Treatment

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: First Aid.

The risk of anaphylaxis from arthropod bites and stings (most commonly due to bees and wasps) is dependent on the amount of exposure (e.g., higher in beekeepers or those who spend a lot of time outdoors) and the length of time the weather is warm each year (which is increasing due to climate change).​[[60]](#GoldenDBK.UpdateOnInsectStingAnaphy-AA6C26E3) Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that occurs in those previously exposed to the allergen. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate emergency attention. Symptoms can occur within minutes or up to several hours after exposure. Reactions can include cutaneous reactions such as hives, severe itching or skin colour changes (redness in lightly pigmented skin or grey/violet/brown black in darkly pigmented skin) and flushing; gastrointestinal reactions such as difficult or painful swallowing, tingling of the mouth, nausea, vomiting or abdominal cramping; respiratory reactions such as swelling of the throat, hoarseness, throat or chest tightness, difficulty speaking, barking cough, wheezing or swelling of the tongue. Any symptom can lead to a potentially fatal reaction, even those that initially appear mild.​[[60]](#GoldenDBK.UpdateOnInsectStingAnaphy-AA6C26E3)​[[61]](#FrithKSmithJJoshiPEtAl.UpdatedAnaph-AA6EB2D0)​[[62]](#RosarioCSFilhoNR.ChildhoodAnaphylax-AA6F4CDE)

First-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine administered as soon as possible. Epinephrine alleviates symptoms by reducing airway edema, increasing bronchodilation and vasoconstriction, and increasing coronary blood flow. It is critical that the patient lie flat during treatment of an anaphylactic reaction in order to increase venous blood return to the heart. Death can occur within minutes if the patient stands, walks or sits up suddenly and blood pressure drops. Patients in respiratory distress may find breathing easier in a sitting position, but it should be on the floor with legs extended straight in front of them, not on a chair. The recovery position can be used for pregnant persons or those unconscious or vomiting.​[[61]](#FrithKSmithJJoshiPEtAl.UpdatedAnaph-AA6EB2D0) A second dose of epinephrine may be administered within 5 minutes if the patient has not responded adequately to the first dose. Up to 20% of insect bite anaphylactic reactions are biphasic; timing of the second phase of the reaction can vary from 30 minutes to 72 hours. Close clinical monitoring is recommended. There are no contraindications to the use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis.​[[61]](#FrithKSmithJJoshiPEtAl.UpdatedAnaph-AA6EB2D0) Epinephrine for self-injection is commercially available in various formats. Information and complete instructions for use are found in the specific product monographs.

**Oral antihistamines** are considered secondary medication to help with hives and itching only, as they do not treat or prevent anaphylaxis.​[[61]](#FrithKSmithJJoshiPEtAl.UpdatedAnaph-AA6EB2D0)

Refer all patients who have reactions to bee or wasp venom to an allergy specialist as soon as possible to confirm cause and discuss management.​[[61]](#FrithKSmithJJoshiPEtAl.UpdatedAnaph-AA6EB2D0)​[[62]](#RosarioCSFilhoNR.ChildhoodAnaphylax-AA6F4CDE) Venom immunotherapy **(VIT)** (desensitization with escalating doses of venom) is effective in reducing subsequent reactions. After a minimum of 3 years of treatment, some patients may be able to stop VIT and continue to have lasting protection, but others will need lifelong regular maintenance dosing to maintain immunity.​[[60]](#GoldenDBK.UpdateOnInsectStingAnaphy-AA6C26E3)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 5](#psc1172n00022) provides a monitoring framework for management of arachnid and insect stings and bites.

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pain/fever | Monitor for increased pain or fever daily for 7 days after bite or sting (monitor for signs of infection). After a tick bite: monitor for 30 days (from time of tick bite or removal) for pain or fever that may indicate a tick-borne disease. After a mosquito bite: monitor for 15 days for pain or fever that may indicate West Nile virus infection. Monitor the degree and duration of pain and fever relief for effectiveness with each analgesic dose. Pain should subside within 24 h . | Pain reduced to a tolerable level for the patient. No fever present. | Treatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs (according to recommended dosing). Patients with significant symptoms past 24–48 h (intolerable pain and high fever) or fever or pain that persists for >7 days require further treatment. |
| Itching | Monitor daily for degree and duration of relief with each application. Relief should occur within minutes of treatment with topical agents and within 1 h for oral agents. After a mosquito bite: monitor daily for 7 days itching relief. | Itching reduced to a tolerable level for the patient (does not affect daily activities or sleep patterns). | Treatment with topical corticosteroids (according to recommended dosing), topical anesthetics up to QID or oral antihistamines (according to recommended dosing). Patients with itching that persists for >7 days despite appropriate treatment require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Swelling, inflammation, skin rash | Monitor daily for signs of increased swelling or inflammation at site (signs of infection). Swelling and inflammation should subside within 24–48 h of bite or sting. Tick bites: monitor for 30 days for rash that may indicate Lyme disease (see Table 1 ). | Minimal swelling or redness at site. No development of rash. | Treatment with topical corticosteroids (according to recommended dosing) or oral antihistamines (according to recommended dosing). Patients with extensive swelling (e.g., if whole limb is involved) require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Local infection (unusual swelling, inflammation or tenderness at bite site, pus or fever) | Monitor daily for up to 7 days for signs of infection. | No signs or symptoms of infection. | Topical antibiotics can be used to treat minor infections caused by scratching the area. Patients with signs and symptoms of local infection that do not respond to topical antibiotics within 48 h require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Systemic symptoms (fever, chills, malaise, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, swollen lymph nodes) | Mosquito bites: monitor for 30 days , as systemic symptoms may indicate infection with West Nile virus. Tick bites: monitor for 30 days , as systemic symptoms may indicate a tick-borne disease. Monitor for 3 months or more for late stage tick-borne disease that was not diagnosed and treated at an earlier stage. | No unexplained systemic symptoms. | Patients presenting with any unexplained systemic symptoms within 30 days of a tick or mosquito bite require further assessment to rule out tick-borne disease or West Nile virus. Oral antibiotics are used to treat most tick-borne diseases. |
| Suspected anaphylaxis​ [a] | Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis; may occur within minutes or up to several hours after exposure. | Symptoms subside and do not recur or worsen during 72 h of observation. | Treat with epinephrine with patient lying flat on back if possible (alternatives include sitting on floor with legs extended straight; recovery position if pregnant, vomiting or unconscious). All cases of suspected anaphylaxis require emergency medical attention for assessment and to monitor for a biphasic reaction (see Emergency Treatment ). |

[a] Reactions can include cutaneous reactions such as hives, severe itching or skin colour changes (redness in lightly pigmented skin or grey/violet/brown black in darkly pigmented skin) and flushing; gastrointestinal reactions such as difficult or painful swallowing, tingling of the mouth, nausea, vomiting or abdominal cramping; respiratory reactions such as swelling of the throat, hoarseness, throat or chest tightness, difficulty speaking, barking cough, wheezing or swelling of the tongue. Any of these symptoms can lead to a potentially fatal reaction, even those that initially appear mild.
