### Introduction

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic viral infection that, left untreated, ultimately leads to death from opportunistic infections and/or specific cancers associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, since the advent and availability of highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the mid-1990s, the prognosis has shifted dramatically.​[[1]](#c0101n00228)​[[2]](#c0101n00421)​[[3]](#c0101n00422) The primary goal of therapy, to preserve the health of the individual living with HIV, can be considered a chronic manageable condition. The benefits of cART are maximized when it is given continuously, starting as early as possible in the course of HIV infection, to avert damage to the immune system and irreversible organ damage caused by chronic inflammation.​[[4]](#c0101n00316)​[[5]](#c0101n00315)​[[6]](#c0101n00332)​[[7]](#c0101n00260)

In addition, widespread use of cART has significant benefits at the population level by preventing new HIV infections.​[[8]](#c0101n00423)​[[9]](#c0101n00420)​[[10]](#MontanerJSLimaVDHarriganPREtAl.Expa-A70C6FF1) In conjunction with education and other prevention strategies, expanded use of cART in the “treatment as prevention” model has the potential to significantly impact the HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis is critical to achieving the proven benefits of early HIV treatment at both the individual and societal levels. This highlights the need to expand HIV testing and incorporate it as part of standard health care for all sexually active adults. This chapter discusses treatment of adult patients with chronic HIV infection as diagnosed by a positive HIV antibody/antigen test; for information related to screening patients who do not have an established diagnosis of HIV infection, see HIV Infection: Prevention.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prolong survival
- Slow disease progression
- Improve quality of life
- Decrease viral replication
- Prevent/reverse immunologic impairment
- Prevent opportunistic infections (for more information, see HIV Infection: Opportunistic Infections)
- Delay/prevent emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV
- Prevent transmission of HIV

### Investigations

- Clinical history:

  - at-risk behaviours (see HIV Infection: Prevention)
  - establish date of infection, if possible, based on a review of past sexual contacts, period of needle sharing, receipt of blood or blood products, availability of a previous negative test, or a history of possible seroconversion illness (e.g., mononucleosis-like or severe flulike illness) shortly after a high-risk exposure
  - general indicators: anorexia, weight loss, fatigue or malaise, lymphadenopathy
  - symptoms of opportunistic infections, e.g., fever, night sweats, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, headache, skin rashes
  - sexual history, HIV status of regular partner(s)
  - mental health
- Social history:

  - alcohol, tobacco and recreational drug use
  - physical activity
  - travel history
  - immigration/residency status
  - medical and drug coverage
  - housing status, e.g., stable/unstable, shared housing, household members who are not aware of HIV status
  - social support, e.g., family, friends, caregivers
  - need for counselling and/or support regarding disclosure
- Past medical history:

  - sexually transmitted infections including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum, herpes simplex, genital warts, pubic lice
  - opportunistic infections, AIDS-defining conditions
  - past history or exposure to tuberculosis (TB); hepatitis A, B or C; varicella (chicken pox or shingles)

    - previous chest x-ray, tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) results
  - conditions that may affect choice of antiretroviral therapy, e.g., kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, liver disease, pancreatitis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, mental health disorder, substance use
  - allergies
  - immunization history
  - prescription and nonprescription medications, including antiretroviral therapy, complementary and alternative therapies, supplements; adverse drug reactions and intolerances
  - menstrual history, gynecological conditions, previous pregnancies, contraception, pregnancy plans, menopause
  - abnormal cervical or anal cytology
- Family history:

  - kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, mental health disorder
- Physical examination:

  - focus on signs of immune dysfunction and indications of opportunistic disease
  - height, weight, BMI, BP, waist circumference
  - direct specific attention to examination of mental health (e.g., depression, mania, anxiety), cognitive status (e.g., attention, memory, speech problems), skin, visual fields, ocular fundi, oral cavity, lymph nodes, abdomen, rectal and genital areas (including cervical Pap smear)
- Laboratory investigations:

  - HIV infection status:
    - HIV antibody/antigen test, if documented evidence of previous positive test result is not available
  - HIV and ART related tests:
    - plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level (viral load), used in conjunction with the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (CD4 count), is the best prognostic marker for progression to AIDS and survival in untreated patients.​[[11]](#c0101n00018) Plasma viral load ranges vary according to the test employed. There is no “safe” level. The most commonly used plasma HIV-1 RNA assay has a quantitation limit of 40 copies/mL
    - CD4 count and percentage are useful in determining where a patient lies in the continuum of HIV disease and the need for specific intervention (see [Table 1](#c0101n00459)). Knowledge of the CD4 count can also help to narrow the differential diagnosis in a symptomatic patient living with HIV. In adults, a CD4 count of 430–1360 cells/mcL (0.43–1.36 gigalitre or G/L) is considered normal in most laboratories
    - HIV drug resistance should be assessed in all patients at baseline (as soon as possible after HIV is diagnosed) and in cases of confirmed viral load rebound to >200 copies/mL while on treatment
    - screen all patients for the presence of the HLA-B\*5701 allele before starting an abacavir-containing regimen; a positive test result should be recorded in the patient’s chart as hypersensitivity to abacavir and is a lifelong contraindication to the use of this agent​[[12]](#c0101n00308)​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)
    - perform a tropism assay to determine the chemokine receptor status (CCR5, CXCR4 or dual-mixed tropic) only if considering use of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc
  - General medical assessment:
    - CBC, differential and platelet count
    - liver (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, albumin, INR) and renal profiles (creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], serum phosphate, urinalysis, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [UPCR])
    - metabolic profile: fasting glucose and/or HbA1c; fasting lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) or apolipoprotein B if fasting triglycerides elevated
    - pregnancy test, if indicated
  - Co-infection assessment:
    - hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and Toxoplasma serologies

      - abdominal ultrasound if positive for hepatitis B or C
    - cultures, NAATs (nucleic acid amplification tests) and smears for sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea and chlamydia) as indicated; from sites based on exposure history
    - TST and/or IGRA, sputum cultures and smears for mycobacteria as indicated
    - chest x-ray
    - serum cryptococcal antigen if CD4 count <100 cells/mcL

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Management recommendations for patients with HIV infection are included in [Table 1](#c0101n00459).

**Table 1:** Management of Patients with HIV Infection

| CD4 count(cells/mcL) | Action |
| --- | --- |
| At all levels | General counselling (risk of onward transmission and practices to prevent transmission, legal implications of HIV nondisclosure with their sexual partner, proper nutrition, physical activity, need for follow-up, importance of adherence) History and physical examination at least annually As soon as patient is ready, start antiretroviral therapy; early initiation of antiretroviral therapy is associated with significantly improved survival​ [15] ​ [16] ​ [17] Plasma viral load every 3–4 months ; can be decreased to every 6 months if on stable antiretroviral therapy with viral load <40 copies/mL and good adherence for >1 y ; increase monitoring if symptomatic or diagnosed with AIDS-defining illness CD4 count every 3–4 months ; CD4 monitoring is optional if viral load <40 copies/mL and CD4 >250 cells/mcL for >1 y; increase monitoring if symptomatic or diagnosed with AIDS Pneumococcal vaccine (per local guidelines and availability); hepatitis A and B vaccines if appropriate based on serology; update diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (Td/TdaP) vaccines as needed; annual influenza vaccination; if required, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines if CD4 >200 cells/mcL and not pregnant; meningococcal vaccine every 5 y ; HPV, herpes zoster, and COVID-19 vaccines (per current local guidelines); Mpox vaccine (if available and appropriate). TST and/or IGRA; treatment of latent tuberculosis infection if indicated (see Tuberculosis ) |

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Antiretroviral Therapy

### General approach to antiretroviral therapy

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is recommended in all individuals living with HIV with detectable HIV viremia. Irrespective of CD4 count, HIV infection confers an increased risk for non-AIDS-associated cancers, coronary artery disease, hepatic and renal disease, and other conditions, possibly due to uncontrolled viral replication and chronic immune activation.​[[6]](#c0101n00332)​[[7]](#c0101n00260)

Durability of the treatment effect is related to the prevention of drug resistance and this is achieved only with consistent suppression of viral replication. Long-term nonprogression of the disease can be expected if the plasma viral load is maintained below the level of detection on a long-term basis; however, the clinical significance of a viral load result between 40 and 200 copies/mL is uncertain.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331) Therefore, the goal of plasma viral load suppression is HIV RNA <40 copies/mL (for polymerase chain reaction assays), whereas the inability to maintain levels <200 copies/mL is considered virologic failure.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)

Effective control of HIV infection with cART reduces the incidence of opportunistic infections and certain cancers and prolongs life.​[[1]](#c0101n00228)​[[2]](#c0101n00421)​[[3]](#c0101n00422) It also decreases infectivity and lowers the risk of HIV transmission from pregnant patients to their infants, between drug-using partners and among sexual contacts.​[[9]](#c0101n00420)​[[18]](#c0101n00028)​[[19]](#c0101n00424) A systematic review by the Public Health Agency of Canada demonstrated a negligible risk of sexual transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive partner who is adherent to antiretroviral therapy and who has a consistently suppressed viral load (<200 copies/mL).​[[20]](#LeMessurierJ-289B66EE)

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy is associated with significantly improved survival.​[[5]](#c0101n00315) Initiation of antiretroviral therapy should be considered more urgently in symptomatic patients; those with a history of an AIDS-defining illness; those with HIV-associated nephropathy, hepatitis B or C co-infection or newly diagnosed malignancy; those with HIV-uninfected sexual partners; and in pregnant patients.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)

Long-term treatment with certain cART may be associated with metabolic complications and reduced bone mineral density; however, these effects are offset by the demonstrated improvement in survival and significantly reduced rates of major cardiovascular, hepatic and renal events associated with continuous antiretroviral therapy.​[[7]](#c0101n00260)​[[21]](#c0101n00229)​[[22]](#c0101n00425)

### Recommended cART regimens

**Combination antiretroviral therapy** (cART) is the standard of care for initial therapy and is defined as a combination of at least 3 active antiretroviral drugs or, in specific cases, 2 antiretroviral drugs.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331) The cART regimens recommended for first-line therapy consist of 2 **nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors** (N[t]RTIs) plus either:

- An **integrase inhibitor**, or
- A **cobicistat**- or **ritonavir-boosted** **protease inhibitor** (PI), or
- A **non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor** (NNRTI).

In specific cases, a 2-drug combination containing the integrase inhibitor/NRTI combination of dolutegravir/​lamivudine is indicated (see [Table 2](#c0101n00038)). Other classes of drugs (**fusion inhibitors** and **entry inhibitors**) are reserved for use in treatment-experienced patients with limited options due to drug resistance, contraindications or intolerable adverse events. Other 2-drug regimens are also available in Canada but are not considered first-line therapy options; they include oral dolutegravir/​rilpivirine and a long-acting injectable antiretroviral combination product (cabotegravir + rilpivirine). See [Table 3](#c0101n00017) for a list of antiretroviral medications available in Canada.

### Considerations affecting choice of cART regimen

When selecting the antiretroviral regimen, consider individual patient characteristics (e.g., pretreatment HIV RNA level and CD4 count, HIV genotypic drug resistance test results, HLA-B\*5701 status), presence of comorbidities (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease), pregnancy or potential for pregnancy, and regimen-specific considerations (e.g., adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, drug coverage, pill burden and dosing frequency) (see [Table 3](#c0101n00017)). Nonadherence to therapy promotes the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains and is the most important remaining challenge in the management of HIV infection.​[[23]](#c0101n00021)​[[24]](#c0101n00426) Counselling and support are critical to ensure ongoing adherence.​[[24]](#c0101n00426)

Drug interactions are an important consideration whenever starting or stopping antiretrovirals or other drugs.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331) In addition to toxicity, reduced serum drug levels can be an important consequence. Suboptimal antiretroviral levels not only reduce efficacy but may also promote resistance. All PIs and NNRTIs are metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system and consequently are associated with many drug interactions. Unboosted integrase inhibitors have fewer clinically significant drug interactions; however, GI absorption can be impaired in the presence of polyvalent cations (e.g., aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium), potentially resulting in subtherapeutic plasma levels of the integrase inhibitor. N[t]RTIs are not metabolized by CYP450 but other interactions can occur.

If a patient experiences unmanageable drug toxicity, simultaneous cessation of *all* antiretroviral medications is recommended prior to starting a new cART regimen. Avoid decreasing the dosage or stopping only 1 or 2 medications, as this can promote the development of resistance.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)​[[25]](#c0101n00026)

In the past, planned treatment interruptions (“drug holidays”) were proposed as a strategy to reduce long-term toxicity and treatment cost for patients; however, the risk of opportunistic infections and death was higher in patients randomized to episodic treatment interruptions based on CD4 count as compared with continuous cART in the SMART study.​[[7]](#c0101n00260) For this reason, treatment interruptions are not recommended.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)

A confirmed rebound in plasma viral load implies treatment failure or nonadherence. If adherence is confirmed, drug resistance testing should be performed and the cART regimen should be selected based on the patient’s antiretroviral therapy history and previous drug resistance results.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)

### Pre- and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

For a discussion regarding pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, see HIV Infection: Prevention.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### HIV Infection and Pregnancy

Optimal management of HIV in pregnancy requires consultation with a physician with expertise in this area. Prepregnancy considerations are beyond the scope of this chapter; for more information, see the [Canadian HIV Pregnancy Planning Guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274714).

Considerations during pregnancy should include optimal therapy of the pregnant patient, results of resistance testing, risk of perinatal transmission of HIV, changes in pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals during pregnancy, and possible teratogenic and other effects of cART on the developing fetus.​[[26]](#c0101n00370) All pregnant patients should be offered cART with a discussion of its risks and benefits.​[[13]](#c0101n00258)​[[14]](#c0101n00331)

### Choices during Pregnancy

A cART regimen in pregnancy should be designed based on the results of drug resistance testing and should preferably include 2 **N[t]RTIs** and either a ritonavir**-boosted PI** or an unboosted **integrase inhibitor**.​[[26]](#c0101n00370) Two-drug regimens are not recommended during pregnancy.

Preferred N[t]RTIs include abacavir/​lamivudine (coformulated) (if the gestational parent’s HLA-B\*5701 test is negative), emtricitabine/​tenofovir DF (coformulated), lamivudine plus tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine/​tenofovir AF (coformulated). Tenofovir DF should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. Twice-daily coformulated lamivudine/​zidovudine is an alternative NRTI in pregnancy.

The preferred ritonavir-boosted PI in pregnancy is twice daily darunavir**/**ritonavir. Cobicistat results in insufficient PI drug levels during the second and third trimesters and thus should not be used as a pharmacokinetic booster during pregnancy.

The preferred integrase inhibitor in pregnancy is dolutegravir. Dolutegravir is dosed once daily, rapidly decreases viral load, is well tolerated and associated with fewer drug interactions than boosted PIs.​[[26]](#c0101n00370) Raltegravir is dosed twice daily in pregnancy and is an alternative integrase inhibitor. In a large study in Botswana, dolutegravir use around the time of conception was associated with a slightly higher risk of fetal neural tube defects (0.3% with dolutegravir vs. 0.1% with other antiretrovirals).​[[27]](#NTD-Botswana) However, updated data from the same study have shown rates of neural tube defects that are not significantly different from those with nondolutegravir regimens.​[[28]](#Zash) Dolutegravir can be considered before and during pregnancy after discussing potential risks and benefits with the patient and ensuring adequate folic acid supplementation.​[[26]](#c0101n00370)​[[29]](#WHO-DTG-NTD)​[[30]](#Zipursky)

Elvitegravir/cobicistat is not recommended for initial use in pregnancy due to low elvitegravir drug levels. Injectable cabotegravir is also not recommended due to its long half-life and lack of safety data in pregnancy. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of bictegravir in pregnancy.

Use of other antiretroviral agents should be considered on an individual basis, in consultation with an expert in the management of HIV during pregnancy.

### Choices during Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding by patients living with HIV is not recommended in Canada due to the risk of HIV transmission to the infant (risk <1% but not zero) and readily available infant formulas. Therefore, HIV treatment recommendations for patients who are breastfeeding are the same as for the general population of patients living with HIV.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Consider cART for all patients living with HIV irrespective of their CD4 count. Initiation of treatment should be considered as soon as possible for all and more urgently in pregnant patients, in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/mcL, and in the presence of certain concomitant medical conditions, e.g., hepatitis B or C co-infection, HIV-associated nephropathy.
- Poor adherence is the most critical determinant of therapeutic failure. Assess patient readiness before starting cART and address, where possible, potential barriers to adherence. Assess regimen tolerability and adherence on an ongoing basis and provide education and support as necessary.
- The target of therapy is to maintain a plasma viral load consistently below the detectable threshold (usually 40 copies/mL with current assays). However, nonquantifiable plasma viral levels do not imply cure or eradication.
- If the plasma viral load rebounds to >200 copies/mL despite ongoing cART, consider nonadherence and viral drug resistance as the most likely causes. Also consider drug interactions that may result in suboptimal therapeutic responses even in an adherent patient.
- Update medication history at each clinic visit. Consider potential drug-drug interactions between antiretrovirals and prescribed, nonprescribed, herbal and complementary/alternative medications, including temporary medications (e.g., for seasonal allergy) and medications not taken orally (e.g., inhalers).
- The variability of the plasma viral load assays is approximately 0.3–0.5 log10 copies/mL. Hence, in untreated patients, changes in plasma viral load of <0.3–0.5 log10 are usually not regarded as clinically significant.​[[31]](#c0101n00023)
- Concurrent illnesses or vaccinations can transiently but substantially increase plasma viral load in patients not receiving cART.​[[32]](#c0101n00024)
- CD4 counts show diurnal variation, from lowest in the morning to highest in the evening.​[[33]](#c0101n00025) Fluctuations of up to 30% may occur, which are not attributable to a change in disease status. Overall, it is important to monitor the trends in CD4 counts over time rather than making treatment decisions based on a single reading.
- As the immune system recovers with cART, patients may experience new or worsening symptoms of opportunistic infections. For more information, see Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) in HIV Infection: Opportunistic Infections.

### Drug Table

**Table 3:** Antiretroviral Medications Commonly Used in Canada for HIV Therapy

[c] Patients with the HLA-B\*5701 allele are predisposed to allergic reactions;​[[12]](#c0101n00308) a positive test result for the allele should be recorded as an allergy to abacavir in the patient’s chart.

[d] The prescribing information for nevirapine classifies patients as male or female. CPhA recognizes that these terms may not accurately reflect the identity of the patient and may not be inclusive of all individuals. Each patient's laboratory tests should be assessed on an individual basis.

[e] Patients with a particular polymorphism in the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) have higher plasma levels of atazanavir and higher bilirubin levels during atazanavir therapy than those without this polymorphism. The risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia during atazanavir therapy is further increased by the presence of distinct variants in the gene coding for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A).​[[48]](#c0101n00255)​[[49]](#c0101n00256)
