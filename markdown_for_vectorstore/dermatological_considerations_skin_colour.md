This chapter is dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of diversity in clinical education and literature concerning the diagnosis and treatment of dermatological conditions in individuals with skin of colour. CPhA has opted to use the term “skin of colour,” acknowledging that individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds may have their own preferred terminology. Recognizing the ever-evolving nature of language, we remain committed to regularly review the most appropriate terminology for describing patients.

### Introduction

The definition of skin of colour (SOC) is complex and evolving. In Canada, more than 30% of the population self-identified as belonging to an ethno-cultural ancestry other than “white” in the 2021 census. In addition to Indigenous peoples, this population consisted mainly of the following racialized groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese.​[[1]](#StatisticsCanada.October262022.TheC-25EA43DC) In dermatology, the term SOC is used to refer to those with deep or rich skin pigmentation, in recognition of the fact that this characteristic is an important consideration in the diagnosis and treatment of skin disorders.

Almost 50% of dermatologists in 1 study reported feeling their training was inadequate to diagnose dermatological disease in patients with skin of colour.​[[2]](#LesterJCTaylorSCChenM-M.Under-repre-5B086117) This puts patients with skin of colour at risk of misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.​[[3]](#ChatrathSBradleyLKentoshJ.Dermatolo-25EB53ED)

This chapter aims to address this knowledge gap by discussing the following topics: physiologic/functional differences between skin colours, health inequities in dermatology, common cultural practices affecting the skin and hair, consideration of skin colour when completing a physical assessment, dermatological conditions that occur predominantly in skin of colour, and information on how the presentation and/or management of common dermatological conditions may differ in darkly pigmented skin compared with lightly pigmented skin.

### Physiologic and Functional Differences between Skin Colours

It is crucial to appreciate that environmental and social determinants of health may play a more significant role than biologic or genetic factors in dermatologic health outcomes​[[4]](#Brown-KorsahJBMcKenzieSOmarDEtAl.Va-25FE3108) (see [Dermatologic Health Inequity](#DermatologicHealthDisparities-2880D3D5)).

Available evidence with respect to physiologic and functional differences between skin of different colours is limited, uses small sample sizes and may not be reflective of the heterogeneity within specific populations.​[[5]](#IwualaCTaylorSC.StructuralAndFuncti-25F9EA50) Further research to expand the knowledge base in this area would be of great benefit in understanding disease etiology and developing more effective therapeutic interventions.

- Melanin is the pigment that gives skin and hair its colour. Within melanocytes, melanin is produced and packaged in small organelles called melanosomes that are distributed to neighbouring keratinocytes via dendritic processes. Melanocytes make 2 chemically distinct types of melanin in the skin: eumelanin (brown-black pigment) and pheomelanin (yellow-red pigment). The density of melanocytes within the skin does not differ between skin colours: variation in pigmentation is attributed primarily to the proportion of eumelanin to pheomelanin; the total amount of melanin produced; and the number, size and distribution of melanosomes. Melanin absorbs UV light and blocks free radical generation, protecting those with darkly pigmented skin from sun damage and aging but increasing their risk of developing pigment-related skin conditions.​[[6]](#HollingerJCKindredCHalderRM.Pigment-5B8FE9B3)​[[7]](#DelBinoSDuvalCBernerdF.ClinicalAndB-5B90F39E)
- Skin barrier function may vary across racial and ethnic categories, though evidence is limited and inconsistent; definitive conclusions have not been made. Differences in fibroblasts, lipid content, and transepidermal water loss and pH, among others, have been reported. Examples of how these findings, if confirmed, may translate into clinical outcomes include theories such as larger fibroblasts in Black skin, contributing to increased prevalence of keloids compared with white skin; decreased ceramide/cholesterol ratios in Black skin compared to white skin, possibly leading to more xerosis and influencing the choice of moisturizer to recommend.​[[4]](#Brown-KorsahJBMcKenzieSOmarDEtAl.Va-25FE3108)​[[5]](#IwualaCTaylorSC.StructuralAndFuncti-25F9EA50)
- Limited studies on hair follicles have shown large variation in the curl pattern, cuticle layers, and growth rate of hair between and within different racial and ethnic groups. Tightly coiled hair has been shown to have less tensile strength and be more prone to breakage than other hair types, increasing the risk of traction alopecia.​[[4]](#Brown-KorsahJBMcKenzieSOmarDEtAl.Va-25FE3108)​[[9]](#LoussouarnGLozanoIPanhardSEtAl.Dive-25FF8138)

### Dermatologic Health Inequity

According to Health Canada, health inequity refers to differences in the health status of individuals or groups which are unfair or unjust and modifiable.​[[10]](#GovernmentOfCanada.SocialDeterminan-28886169) The following factors are felt to play a role in creating dermatology-related health inequity in racialized populations.

- Racial bias in medicine leading to:

  - lack of high-quality, evidence-based research on skin conditions affecting racialized groups​[[11]](#MarchettiMAAdamsonASHalpernAC.Melan-288EE202)​[[12]](#McKenzieSBrown-KorsahJBSyderNCEtAl.-2894BD13)
  - under-representation of racialized groups in clinical trials for dermatological conditions​[[13]](#ReddyVDMyersBAChanSYEtAl.AReviewOfC-2895B72E)
  - lack of health-care provider education on diagnosis and management of skin conditions in racialized groups​[[11]](#MarchettiMAAdamsonASHalpernAC.Melan-288EE202)​[[12]](#McKenzieSBrown-KorsahJBSyderNCEtAl.-2894BD13)
  - the development of dermatology scoring tools (e.g., SCORAD, EASI) used to assess severity of skin disease that often rely on erythema as an important indicator, which can be underestimated in darkly pigmented skin​[[12]](#McKenzieSBrown-KorsahJBSyderNCEtAl.-2894BD13)
- Inequity in the environmental and social determinants of health often experienced by racialized groups, for example:​[[10]](#GovernmentOfCanada.SocialDeterminan-28886169)​[[12]](#McKenzieSBrown-KorsahJBSyderNCEtAl.-2894BD13)​[[14]](#JeongDNguyenHNTTyndallMEtAl.Antibio-288F9E94)

  - lower levels of income, employment, education
  - food insecurity, water safety, congested or unstable housing
  - experiences of discrimination, racism and historical trauma
  - reluctance to seek help or mistrust of health-care providers in communities where inequity has had an impact​[[15]](#JaiswalJHalkitisPN.TowardsAMoreIncl-7196B426)
  - limited access to dermatological care
  - limited access to timely prescription refills or affordable basic skin-care products

Research assessing the clinical consequences of these inequalities is, unsurprisingly, also limited, but includes the following examples: despite lower prevalence, Black patients with skin cancer present with more advanced disease and have lower survival rates compared with white patients;​[[16]](#CulpMBLunsfordNB.MelanomaAmongNon-H-2898BC1E)​[[17]](#GuptaAKBharadwajMMehrotraR.SkinCanc-66D1C12B) Black patients are less likely to receive treatment for acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis compared with white patients;​[[18]](#BarbieriJSShinDBWangSEtAl.Associati-28994172)​[[19]](#BellMAWhangKAThomasJEtAl.RacialAndE-5C0BC7D0) Canadian First Nations communities experience disproportionately high rates of communicable diseases including community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*.​[[14]](#JeongDNguyenHNTTyndallMEtAl.Antibio-288F9E94)

Expanding dermatological medical education and clinician training, improving diversity in study participants, and enhancing research funding directly related to common conditions in skin of colour will help to reduce dermatologic health inequities; however, significant improvements in the environmental and social determinants of health in racialized groups on a societal level are also required.

### Cultural Considerations in Dermatology

Cultural dermatology is a concept used to describe the range of cutaneous manifestations arising from therapeutic or cosmetic practices that were once localized to specific regions of the world but whose prevalence and pattern have been impacted by globalization.​[[20]](#KannanRK.CulturalDermatosesAReivew.-298D89A4) Increasing population diversity has led to sharing of cultural practices and traditions, making it increasingly important for clinicians to recognize the physiologic and pathologic sequelae associated with them.​[[21]](#VashiNAPatzeltNWiryaSEtAl.Dermatose-298DC4F1)

It is important that clinicians use neutral and nonjudgmental language when discussing these practices with their patients. Being sensitive to cultural differences and willing to work alongside traditional, complementary and alternative treatments, if possible, is recommended.​[[22]](#WoundsInternationalInternationalCon-66489A11)

See [Table 1](#PresentationAndPossibleComplication-29956ED8).

### Patient Assessment

The following suggestions provide general guidance on providing inclusive care for all patients:​[[22]](#WoundsInternationalInternationalCon-66489A11)

- Recognize that appropriate inclusive language is constantly evolving, and that remaining attuned to those changes takes deliberate and thoughtful education and reflection.
- Keep language simple, respectful, neutral and professional. Avoid comparative terms (e.g., “darker”) that imply light is the norm or baseline skin colour.
- Do not equate race with skin colour (e.g., not all people who are Black have darkly pigmented skin).
- Ask for the patient’s perspective, including their thoughts and feelings about their skin condition.
- Do not make assumptions; ask for the patient’s input whenever possible.
- Respect the patient’s individual beliefs. Some individuals, communities or populations may mistrust established health-care systems, especially if they have had negative experiences in the past.​[[15]](#JaiswalJHalkitisPN.TowardsAMoreIncl-7196B426)

A full dermatological examination in patients of all skin colours includes inspection of the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. A thorough skin assessment, including consideration of the following points, will prevent over-reliance on visible changes alone and improve recognition of disease states in patients of all skin colours:​[[22]](#WoundsInternationalInternationalCon-66489A11)​[[24]](#BritishAssociationOfDermatologists.-6C7445F7)

- Establish a baseline skin colour to allow for accurate assessment of changes (use of an objective tool rather than a subjective description is recommended).​[[25]](#HoBKRobinsonJK.ColorBarToolForSkinT-66560557)
- Compare appearance of the area in question to the surrounding or healthy skin: colour, texture, shininess, tightness, swelling (subtle swelling may appear as more prominent or widely spaced pores).
- Note how the affected area feels to the touch compared to the surrounding or healthy skin: temperature (warm or cold to the touch), spongy or firm, texture.
- Ask how the affected area feels to the patient: pain, itch, change in sensation.
- Note overall condition/integrity of the skin.

Information on patient assessment for specific dermatological conditions can be found in the relevant chapters of *[CPS](https://cps.pharmacists.ca/)* (e.g., Acne, Atopic Dermatitis, Psoriasis). Additional information specific to the assessment of skin conditions in patients with skin of colour is provided in [Table 2](#AdditionalConsiderationsForPhysical-32D38432). Incorporating this information into the assessment of patients with skin of colour will enhance disease identification and patient outcomes.

| Body Area | Additional Considerations Pertaining to Skin of Colour | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skin |
| Erythema (changes in the appearance of the skin caused by increased blood flow, often associated with inflammation and infection) | Colour change associated with increased blood flow to the area can range from pink to red to purple on various underlying skin colours and can be missed in darkly pigmented skin. In darkly pigmented skin, there may be a purplish hue surrounding dermal lesions. Because erythema may be missed on darkly pigmented skin, thoroughly assess/inquire about other signs and symptoms that may be indicators of inflammation/infection: pain, burning, itching, increased warmth of the skin area, swelling (appearing as smooth, shiny or tight skin), scaling, crusting, erosions and general malaise. | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library . Photo credit: Richard Usatine MD. |
| Interdigital areas, sides of fingers and toes, dorsum of hands and feet, palms, and soles | Have patients remove shoes and socks; inspect these areas carefully, as some skin cancers can occur beyond sun-exposed areas in patients with darkly pigmented skin (e.g., melanoma often on palmar, plantar, subungual areas).​ [28] See Table 3 and Table 4 . | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library . Photo credit: Girand/BSIP. |
| Pigmentary changes (hypo- or hyperpigmented macules or patches) | Postinflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation occurs after inflammation due to a skin disease (e.g., dermatitis, acne, psoriasis), external injury (e.g., insect bites, surgery) or irritation due to topical agents. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation disproportionately affects patients with skin of colour and significantly affects their quality of life.​ [8] ​ [29] | Hyperpigmentation Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library . Photo credit: Dr. P. Marazzi. Hypopigmentation Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library . |
| Pallor (skin appears to be a lighter colour than usual due to reduced oxyhemoglobin levels) | May present as ashen, grey or yellowish in darkly pigmented skin but often not easily visible. Identify reduced darkness in the palmar creases. Comparing the patient’s palms with those of a family member may be helpful (keeping in mind limitations in sensitivity and specificity). | Reproduced with permission from The Lancet . Photo credit: Jane Crawley. |
| Cyanosis (discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to high levels of deoxygenated hemoglobin) | Look for cyanosis where the epidermis is thin, the vascular supply is abundant or there is the least amount of pigment: oral mucous membranes (buccal, sublingual), lips, palms, soles, nail beds. Patients with darkly pigmented skin: bluish tint to palms or conjunctiva; greyish-white colour around tongue or lips; maroon tinge to nail beds.​ [30] Patients with naturally yellow-toned skin: general greyish-green appearance to skin.​ [31] | Reproduced with permission from Skin Deep : A DFTB Project. |
| Hair/Scalp |
| Hair breakage, decreased hair density, hair that is not lengthening, and focal/localized hair loss | Knowledge of routine hair practices related to culture or hair type and the possible complications associated with them is important (see Table 1 ). Be aware of hair-related conditions that may be more common in tightly coiled hair types (e.g., central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, traction alopecia). See Table 3 . The presence of weaves, braids or wig caps may impede evaluation. Additionally, clinicians must be aware that it may not be feasible to conduct a physical assessment of the scalp or hair based on the patient’s personal, cultural or religious beliefs. A verbal history can still be obtained in these situations. | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024. |
| Nails |
| Discoloration of the nail plate | Longitudinal melanonychia (brown or black bands or streaks along the length of the nail plate) is a benign cause of nail discoloration in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Incidence reportedly varies from 1% in the white population to 10–20% in Japanese and Asian populations to 77–100% in the Black population. It is more common on fingernails than toenails and generally involves multiple digits.​ [32] Subungual melanoma affects the nail apparatus and can be missed due to a mistaken diagnosis of melanonychia. Subungual melanoma favours a single digit, most likely the thumb of an adult, whereas benign melanonychia generally involves multiple nails. Signs suggestive of the diagnosis include irregular pigmentation, broad pigment band (at least 3 mm ), a tapered band with a wider base at the origin of the nail plate, blurry and fuzzy borders, and variegated colour. Refer immediately for diagnosis.​ [33] See Table 3 . | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024. |

### Dermatological Conditions Affecting Skin of Colour More Frequently or More Severely

[Table 3](#DermatologicalConditionsThatOccurMo-32D2D01B) presents several skin conditions that affect people with darkly pigmented skin more frequently or more severely than people with lightly pigmented skin. These conditions can have significant impact on mental health and quality of life, yet they are often underdiagnosed or undertreated in patients with skin of colour.​[[34]](#FrazierWTProdduturSSwopeK.CommonDer-345D88A3)

| Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA)​ [47] (form of scarring alopecia resulting in permanent hair loss) | Appearance Permanent destruction of the hair follicle with irreversible hair loss Some types can cause inflammatory changes on scalp with erythema, dyspigmentation and scale Signs of hair breakage Possibly tenderness, burning, pruritus Distribution Hair loss typically begins at the vertex or mid-scalp and extends outward in a centrifugal manner Can affect other hair-bearing sites such as eyebrows Prevalence/Age at Onset Occurs almost exclusively in Black women, with up to 15% affected Onset: 30– 55 y of age Risk Factors Exact cause of CCCA is unknown and is likely multifactorial Proposed causative factors include fungal infections, bacterial infections, autoimmune disease, genetics | Rule out underlying causes or diseases. Eliminate traumatic hair practices or exogenous products that may exacerbate hair loss. Topical or intralesional steroids. Possibly oral steroids if rapid or progressive. Additional oral therapies used include antimalarials, oral retinoids, oral tetracyclines, cyclosporin. | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024. |

Mitigation strategies such as compression therapy (e.g., bandages, support garments). Intralesional therapy with triamcinolone with or without fluorouracil injected on a weekly or monthly basis. Other modalities such as laser therapy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy have been used. Surgical excision is reserved for refractory cases because of the high risk of keloid recurrence. | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024. |

### Special Considerations for Skin of Colour in the Management of Common Dermatological Conditions

In addition to having a working knowledge of conditions that are more frequent or more severe (see [Table 3](#DermatologicalConditionsThatOccurMo-32D2D01B)), health-care providers must also be aware of differences in presentation and treatment of common dermatological conditions in skin of colour. Timely recognition, diagnosis and treatment is vital to improve quality of life and prevent progression to more severe disease in many cases.​[[67]](#KunduRVPattersonS.DermatologicCondi-5D987761) See [Table 4](#SpecialConsiderationsForSkinOfColou-32D33DED).

**Table 4:** Special Considerations for Skin of Colour in the Management of Common Dermatological Conditions

| Condition | Differences in Presentation | Special Considerations for Management in SOC | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acne​ [27] ​ [68] ​ [69] | Erythema may not be readily visible or may appear as a grey or purplish hue. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a commonly associated feature or sequela of acne. In moderate to severe cases, acne can induce the development of keloids or hypertrophic scars. | Management of acne: Consider and address the role hair-care practices, such as the use of potentially comedogenic products for managing tightly coiled or chemically/thermally treated hair, play in the development of acne (e.g., pomade acne)​ [68] Consider and address the role topical corticosteroids used for skin lightening may play Strategies for improving outcomes in patients with skin of colour include early initiation of therapy and careful consideration of tolerability of active ingredients and vehicle formulations Topical retinoids are particularly beneficial for patients with skin of colour, as they treat the acne lesions and help ameliorate postinflammatory hyperpigmentation See also Acne Prevention and management of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, hypertrophic scarring and keloids: Advise the use of adjunctive skin care to minimize irritation and dryness Initiate treatment early in disease course to limit development of inflammation Carefully consider tolerability of active ingredients and vehicle formulations, then titrate application to avoid irritation Management of hyperpigmentation: hydroquinone alone in lower concentrations or, more commonly, in combination with a topical retinoid and topical corticosteroid, chemical peels, laser therapy Management of hypertrophic scarring, keloids: compression garments, intralesional corticosteroids with or without fluorouracil, surgical excision (see Keloids, Table 3 ) | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024. |
| Atopic dermatitis​ [12] ​ [27] | Erythema may be difficult to discern or may present as violaceous or hyper/hypopigmentation. May present with a more distinct papular morphology. Micropapular lichenoid or psoriasis-like coin-shaped lesions occur frequently in children of African descent. Japanese and Korean patients may have a more psoriasis-like appearance: clearly demarcated lesions with increased scaling.​ [70] Lichenification (skin thickening with exaggerated skin lines) is more common in SOC than in lightly pigmented skin. More extensor or truncal involvement. More likely to develop hypo- or hyperpigmentation after the inflammation has resolved. | Management: no differences based on skin colour (see Atopic Dermatitis ). Studies have demonstrated that Black patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis are less likely to receive indicated prescription medications, delaying treatment and increasing disease progression.​ [19] | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024.

| Psoriasis​ [12] ​ [19] ​ [71] ​ [72] | Tends to present with thicker plaques, more scaling and greater BSA involvement. Inflammation in SOC presents as violaceous or hyperpigmented and is less conspicuous than in lightly pigmented skin. No anatomical differences in the location of psoriasis, but potential increased BSA involved at presentation. | Management: no differences based on skin colour (see Psoriasis ). Less common in darkly pigmented skin; however, the disease burden, including severity and impact on quality of life, is greater. Underdiagnosed and undertreated in darkly pigmented skin. Black and brown skin is at highest risk of dyspigmentation. Consider risk of hyperpigmentation with phototherapy. Be aware of other conditions that may mimic psoriasis, e.g., lichen planus (especially hypertrophic type), cutaneous lupus. | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library .

| Skin cancer ​ [12] ​ [17] ​ [39] ​ [40] ​ [41] ​ [73] | Basal cell carcinoma: Lesions may appear as pearly, translucent, telangiectatic, ulcerated or crusting nodules. In darkly pigmented skin, the lesions are often pigmented and the pearly appearance or telangiectasia may be difficult to detect Squamous cell carcinoma: Usually occurs on non-sun-exposed sites in SOC Lesion may present as a solitary, erythematous nodule or plaque that will often scale, crust or bleed Melanoma (other than acral lentiginous): The most common type of melanoma in people with darkly pigmented skin is acral lentiginous melanoma; see Table 3 Non-acral lentiginous melanoma: flat brown or black spot (commonly in a mole or other dark spot) with irregular edges—may be difficult to see on darkly pigmented skin | Management: no difference based on skin colour. Skin cancer is much less common in SOC than in lightly pigmented skin, but associated morbidity and mortality are often greater due to delays in detection and diagnosis at a later stage of the disease. | Basal Cell Carcinoma Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org ; 2024.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Skin cancers pose a significant risk in skin of colour. Clinicians are advised to focus on preventive measures such as performing regular skin exams, educating patients on self-examination, and promoting public education and screening programs.​[[41]](#GlosterHMNealK.SkinCancerInSkinOfCo-30BF3839)
- Use of a broad-spectrum (ultraviolet A and B protection) sunscreen with an SPF ≥30 can reduce the incidence of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.​[[74]](#FatimaSBraunbergerTMohammadTFEtAl.T-30CCE404) There is some research showing that sunscreen products formulated with iron oxide (especially in addition to zinc oxide) provide improved protection from blue light (such as that from electronic devices like smartphones),​[[75]](#BernsteinEFSarkasHWBolandP.IronOxid-66D4DC46) which may be particularly beneficial to patients with skin of colour who are more likely to suffer with melasma or hyperpigmentation.
