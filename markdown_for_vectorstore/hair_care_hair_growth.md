### Pathophysiology

Humans are born with a fixed number of hair follicles. Approximately 100 000 hair follicles are on the scalp alone. Two types of hair are found on a human body: vellous and terminal. Vellous hair is fine, soft hair that is nonpigmented and covers the body. Terminal hair is generally long, coarse hair that is pigmented and covers the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes. Additionally, terminal hair grows on the face, chest, legs, arms, axillae and pubic area in response to androgens at puberty. Decreased estrogen levels can also allow androgens to stimulate terminal hair growth in menopausal women.​[[1]](#psc1162n1001)

Hair growth occurs in 3 stages on the scalp:​[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)​[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

1. The active growing phase or anagen stage lasts 2–6 years and determines hair length. Normally about 85–95% of follicles are in this stage at any one time on a human scalp.
2. The transitional phase or catagen stage can last 2–3 weeks after which the follicle degenerates and growth stops. On a normal scalp, approximately 1–3% of the follicles are in this stage.
3. The 3​rd stage is the resting phase or telogen stage, which lasts 3–4 months. Approximately 15% of follicles are in this stage on a normal scalp at any time. Shedding occurs during the telogen phase with approximately 75–100 scalp hairs shed each day (about 0.1% of scalp hair).

### Hair Loss (Alopecia)

Androgenetic alopecia (sometimes referred to as androgenic alopecia) is the most common type of hair loss in both men and women. It is commonly referred to as male-pattern hair loss/male-pattern baldness or female-pattern hair loss/female-pattern baldness.

The following information relates to androgenetic alopecia:​[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)​[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

- Androgenetic alopecia is a hereditary form of androgen-induced diffuse hair loss that presents as a reduction in hair thickness as well as hair loss.
- The exact influence of genetics on androgenetic alopecia is unknown. The androgen receptor gene is located on the x chromosome and passed from mother to son; however, family studies have also shown marked resemblance of hair loss between fathers and sons.​[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)
- The actual number of hair follicles remains the same in those with androgenetic alopecia, and the growth cycle is constant but the anagen or growth stage is somewhat shorter, producing a shorter, thinner hair shaft. This thinner hair shaft covers less scalp, the area becomes progressively larger, and balding appears, particularly in men.
- In men, hair thinning starts in the crown area, gradually progressing to the mid-scalp area.
- Female-pattern hair loss is also referred to as androgenetic alopecia but it appears that androgens play a smaller role than in male-pattern hair loss.
- In women, hair loss is milder than in men and presents as central thinning or “widening of the part line.”

Telogen effluvium is an abnormal number of hair follicles prematurely entering the telogen or resting phase. The following information relates to telogen effluvium:​[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)​[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

- With this condition, excessive hair shedding and thinning occurs in the scalp, possibly followed about 3–4 months later by hair loss in the pubic and underarm areas. More than 300 hairs are lost per day (normal is 75–100 per day).
- Causes can include hormonal changes during pregnancy; severe psychological stress; injury; or stress from infections, serious illness or major surgery; endocrine disorders; iron deficiency; vitamin D deficiency and weight loss.
- In about one-third of the cases, no cause can be definitely determined.
- Hair loss generally begins 1–3 months after the causative event.
- Hair loss can last up to 6 months after correcting the causative factor.

Anagen effluvium is the loss of hair over the entire scalp. The following information relates to anagen effluvium:​[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)​[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

- Hair loss is usually sudden and severe, affecting most of the anagen scalp hairs simultaneously.
- Anagen effluvium can be caused by chemotherapy, radiation to the head, certain medications (see [Table 1](#psc1162n00006)) and heavy metal toxicity. Hair loss due to chemotherapy generally begins 1–3 weeks after beginning treatment.
- Normal hair growth is generally rapidly restored (within 1–3 months) once the underlying cause is removed.

Alopecia areata is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the hair follicles and nail matrix. The following information relates to alopecia areata:​[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

- Alopecia areata usually appears as patchy hair loss on the scalp but may involve any area of the body.
- It can occur at any age but commonly affects children and younger adults.
- It can be associated with pre-existing autoimmune disorders such as thyroid conditions, systemic lupus erythematosus and vitiligo.
- There is also a family history connection with alopecia areata, as those with early onset often have a close family member with the condition.
- Physical stress, emotional stress and some types of infections can also cause this condition.
- Alopecia areata typically presents as smooth round or oval patches on the scalp but also can appear on any other hairy areas of the body.
- There is no clinical evidence of inflammation or scarring in the affected area.
- Nail pitting or ridging can also occur and may be a function of the disease itself.
- The condition is generally self-limiting and hair can spontaneously regrow. Chronic, extensive forms are often associated with a family history of hair loss that may not regrow. This chronic hair loss can occur in children with an onset prior to 5 years of age.

Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by excessive pulling of the hair, primarily from hairstyles such as tight buns, ponytails, braids and hair extensions. The use of chemical hair straighteners weakens the hair shaft and increases the risk of developing traction alopecia. Determining types of hairstyles commonly worn, combined with examination of the scalp, can aid in diagnosis. The frontotemporal margins of the scalp are often affected, as this is the area where maximum or long-term tension is most likely and will show hair loss and thinning along the margin or a strip of thin hair at the edge of a patch of alopecia (fringe sign). The frontotemporal margins may also show redness and/or pustules if traction folliculitis is present.​[[4]](#BilleroVMitevaM.TractionAlopeciaThe-C12F9199)​[[5]](#AkingbolaCOVyasJ.TractionAlopeciaAN-C1304C75)

Inflammatory scalp conditions caused by bacterial infections, parasitic infections and dermatitis can cause hair loss. Compulsive self-inflicted hair loss (trichotillomania) can also cause patchy hair loss. These conditions usually present with erythema, scale, itch or irritation.

**Table 1:** Drugs Associated with Hair Loss​​[[a]](#afn95581)[[1]](#psc1162n1001)[[2]](#PhillipsTGSlomianyWPAllisonR.HairLo-58A186F2)[[3]](#PatelMHarrisonSSinclairR.DrugsAndHa-58A1D4C9)

| ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) Androgens (testosterone, illicit use of anabolic steroids) Anticoagulants (dalteparin, enoxaparin, warfarin) Antidepressants (fluoxetine, possibly sertraline) Antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid; may be dose dependent) Antimanic agents (lithium) | Antineoplastics (alkalating agents, antimetabolites, vinca alkaloids) Antiparkinson agents (levodopa) Beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol) Heavy metals (arsenic, gold, lead, mercury) Oral contraceptives (with interruption of long-term therapy) Retinoids (may be dose dependent) |

[a] Specific drugs listed are given as examples only; other medications in the same class may have similar effects.

### Excessive Hair Growth

Hirsutism is the production of excessive terminal hair in a male-pattern distribution in women. It is usually a consequence of increased androgen activity in women caused by an underlying medical problem such as polycystic ovary syndrome, androgen-secreting tumours, Cushing syndrome, acromegaly or thyroid dysfunction. Androgenic medications (danazol, testosterone) may also be a cause of hirsutism and must be considered when diagnosing this condition.​[[6]](#psc1162n1003) Many peri- and postmenopausal women experience increased facial hair growth due to hormone fluctuations.​[[7]](#Blume-PeytaviUAtkinSGielerUEtAl.Ski-044DE531)

Hypertrichosis is excessive hair growth that is either hereditary or caused by medications such as glucocorticoids, phenytoin, minoxidil or cyclosporine. Hypertrichosis is not caused by increased androgen activity but can be aggravated by it.​[[6]](#psc1162n1003)

### Goals of Therapy

Goals of therapy for hair loss:

- Correct or treat underlying conditions that may be causing hair loss
- Maintain healthy-appearing hair by decreasing the rate of thinning and increasing coverage in areas of loss
- Consider changing medications if causative factor
- Manage psychological factors such as self-esteem and mood changes

Goals of therapy for excessive hair growth:

- Correct or treat underlying conditions that may be causing excessive hair growth
- Remove or control growth of excess body hair
- Consider changing medications if causative factor
- Manage psychological factors such as self-esteem and mood changes

### Patient Assessment

The assessment process is an opportunity to educate patients about the various factors that contribute to hair growth changes, and effective treatment methods to either reverse or cosmetically cover the condition. Patients require further investigation when they present with unusual changes in hair growth and/or significant concerns about their hair changes. An approach to the patient with hair-related concerns is presented in [Figure 1](#fig-11723-08D7E616) and [Figure 2](#AssessmentAndManagementOfExcessiveH-E756FC1C).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

### Hair Care

Hair colour, texture, body and curliness are genetically determined. Shiny hair that has a smooth texture and clean cut ends and has not been damaged by chemical treatments is considered “healthy hair.” When the cuticle is damaged, hair can appear dull, feel rough and brittle, and have split ends.​[[8]](#psc1162n1002)​[[9]](#psc1162n1005)

Repeated chemical treatments (bleaching, colouring, perming), poor grooming habits and exposure to the environment can cause hair texture to change and result in hair breakage. This progressive degeneration of the hair shaft is called “weathering” and contributes to structural weakening of the hair, making it tangle easier and appear rough.​[[8]](#psc1162n1002)

To maintain healthy hair and minimize damage:​[[9]](#psc1162n1005)​[[10]](#psc1162n1004)​[[11]](#GavazzoniDiasMF.HairCosmeticsAnOver-8EC50B0F)​[[12]](#DraelosZD.ShampoosConditionersAndCa-8EC550C3)

- Have hair cut by a professional to remove ends that are damaged.
- Use appropriate shampoos designed for the type of hair (dry, damaged or chemically treated hair), and condition hair regularly (according to the recommended frequency for the specific product).
- Minimize exposure to harsh chemical treatments such as perms, dyes, bleaches and straighteners.​[[9]](#psc1162n1005)
- Avoid excessive brushing. Use a brush with natural, round-ended bristles, and brush gently. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle or comb wet hair.
- Minimize use of blow-dryers, curling irons and straightening irons. Use a lower setting on a blow-dryer, and use a diffuser to blow-dry chemically treated hair.

The frequency of hair washing may be influenced by length of hair, culture, sex, social pressures, economics and individual preference; daily washing is not harmful. Various hair-care products can be used to cosmetically enhance the hair's appearance (see [Table 2](#n01111)).

**Table 2:** Hair-Care Products​[[8]](#psc1162n1002)[[9]](#psc1162n1005)[[10]](#psc1162n1004)[[11]](#GavazzoniDiasMF.HairCosmeticsAnOver-8EC50B0F)[[12]](#DraelosZD.ShampoosConditionersAndCa-8EC550C3)

| Product | Action | Uses | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shampoos | Detergent component helps remove oil, dirt, sweat, fungal elements and hair-care products (styling gel, hair spray). Primarily clean the scalp but also prevent hair shaft damage. Baby shampoo contains amphoteric detergents that are less irritating to eyes. | Routine use as part of a personal hygiene regimen to maintain healthy hair. | Shampoos are formulated for hair that is considered to be normal, greasy, dry or chemically treated. Mild shampoos for hair loss may contain sodium laureth sulfate (primary surfactant). Daily use is not harmful provided the product is well formulated. |
| Conditioners | Contain cationic polymers (balance the negativity of damaged hair), film formers (fill hair shaft defects) or proteins (thought to restore protein to damaged hair). Lubricate and moisturize hair leaving it soft, smooth and hydrated, which decreases static. Reduce static electricity and restore manageability by reducing friction on the hair shaft. | Restore appearance, softness and manageability of hair. Decrease friction, frizz and tangles. Recondition hair after chemical treatments and physical trauma such as blow-drying and brushing. | Instant conditioners are applied immediately after shampooing and left on for a short period of time. Conditioners that remain on the hair longer are more effective. Deep conditioners, used for very dry hair, are creams that are left on for 20–30 min and may or may not require heat to increase penetration. |
| Styling gels, sprays, mousses, sculpting gels and waxes | Contain large-molecular-weight polymers, proteins, and/or resins to hold hair in place or coat hair, adding thickness and texture. Silicone-containing products provide sheen, lubricate and increase resistance to humidity, making hair more manageable. | Create changes in hair volume or style. May be useful for those with thinning hair, low hair density or if increased volume is desired. | Can be used to improve appearance of hair loss (add volume, make hair look fuller, keep hair in place to cover thin areas). Mousses aid in styling, are soft to touch and can be easily removed. Styling lotions are applied to wet hair and hold style when blow-drying. |
| Hair colouring agents | Dyes that cause a gradual hair colouring use metallic dyes that cause a chemical reaction on the hair shaft. Temporary colours are water-soluble dyes consisting of large molecules that are deposited on the hair shaft. Semipermanent dyes are mainly synthetic. They consist mainly of low-molecular-weight coal tar dyes that penetrate the hair shaft easily. Permanent colour results from an oxidation process within the hair shaft and is irreversible. | Alter the colour of hair through various methods. Gradual dyes change grey hair incrementally over a few weeks to brown or black. Temporary dyes are used to cover small amounts of grey, brighten natural or coloured hair or remove yellow tones from grey hair. Semipermanent dyes are used to cover grey, produce highlights or to change hair tones. Permanent dyes are used to cover grey or change hair colour. | Gradual dyes must be used continuously for colour change to remain, and are inexpensive. Hair can become stiff, dull and brittle and colour quality is often poor. Temporary dyes are safe and gentle. They are available as rinses, gels, mousses or sprays that are easily washed out. Semipermanent dyes can cause contact dermatitis. These dyes last 4–6 wk depending on the condition of the hair. Natural vegetable dyes such as henna have largely been replaced by synthetic formulations for use as semipermanent dyes. Permanent dyes are re-applied every 4–6 wk depending on rate of hair growth. These dyes contain ammonia and/or peroxide and can damage hair. |
| Permanents, straighteners/relaxers | Changes the chemical structure of hair shaft by altering disulfide bonds. Chemical hair straightening also involves mechanically straightening the hair once it has been treated. | Used to either curl or add wave to hair or to straighten hair that is naturally curly. | Process must be repeated every 6–12 wk based on individual's hair. May damage hair if too strong, left on too long or used too frequently. Often irritate the scalp. |

### Hair Loss

Educate patients with traction alopecia that the hair loss can be reversed in the early stages by discontinuing the hairstyles that were causing the traction/tension on the hair and avoiding use of chemical perms/straighteners.​[[5]](#AkingbolaCOVyasJ.TractionAlopeciaAN-C1304C75)

Nonpharmacologic options for patients with hair loss include proper hair grooming, cosmetic hair products and camouflage techniques. Hair shafts are most susceptible to breaking when wet; therefore, patients with thinning hair should not brush the hair while wet but instead detangle with a wide-toothed comb once slightly dry. Hair styling products such as sprays, mousses, styling gels and sculpturing gels make the hair appear to have more volume and thickness. Hair extensions, wigs and hair pieces are also becoming more acceptable and improving in quality, providing a minimally invasive method to cover hair loss areas.​[[12]](#DraelosZD.ShampoosConditionersAndCa-8EC550C3)

Follicle transplants can be considered when there has been limited success with medical treatments. The procedure is done on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia. The transplanted hair will grow over a 3- to 6-month period postprocedure.

Low-level laser (red light) therapy shows some promise but the evidence is of poor quality.​[[13]](#VanZuurenEFedorowiczZSchoonesJ.Inte-5B3DF960)​[[14]](#GuptaAKFoleyKA.ACriticalAssessmentO-5B31E0AE) A number of devices for home use that administer low-level laser therapy (supposedly to stimulate metabolic processes needed for hair growth) are also being investigated and aggressively marketed. Industry-sponsored studies appear promising, but there is no independent evidence of effectiveness and anecdotal reports so far are disappointing.​[[15]](#DermNetNZ.LowDoseLaserTherapyForHai-8EBE9DFA)​[[16]](#HessionMTMarkovaAGraberEM.AReviewOf-8EC3AC1C)

Scalp microneedling may activate follicle stem cells, which may be beneficial in certain types of hair loss. More research is needed.

### Excessive Hair Growth

Weight loss may lead to decreased androgen levels and subsequent improvement in excessive hair growth in obese women, particularly in those women with polycystic ovary syndrome.​[[17]](#LiuKMotanTClamanP.No.350x2013Hiruti-C1333C0D)

Excess hair can be routinely controlled with physical removal by shaving, waxing, plucking, threading or application of depilatory creams. These forms of physical removal are all associated with the regrowth of the hair and possible skin irritation. They are often used in combination with more permanent hair removal methods. Hair does not grow back any faster, thicker or denser than normal.​[[18]](#SomaniNTurvyD.HirsutismAnEvidence-b-950EEDF4)​[[19]](#psc1162n1008)​[[20]](#psc1162n1006)

- Shaving removes hair at the skin level and is suitable for most areas, but the hair grows back quickly. This method does not affect the rate of hair growth and is a safe and inexpensive way to control regular hair growth.​[[20]](#psc1162n1006)
- Cold waxing involves application of wax-impregnated strips that are pressed on the skin then pulled off in the direction opposite to hair growth. Warm waxing involves wax that is heated to 37°C and then spread over the area in the direction of hair growth. The waxed area is covered with strips and allowed to cool. The strips are then pulled off against the direction of hair growth. Hot waxing consists of melted wax spread over the desired area against the direction of hair growth and allowed to cool. It is then quickly pulled off.​[[21]](#psc1162n1007) Waxing allows the area to be free of hair for several days but it can be painful and present the possibility of skin burns when performed by someone not trained in the field.
- Plucking can be effective for small areas (eyebrows, upper lip and chin), but is time consuming, painful and temporary.​[[21]](#psc1162n1007)​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)
- Threading is a process by which twisted cotton thread is used to pull the hair from the follicle. It is used to temporarily remove hair from small areas. Training and experience are necessary to obtain a good result.
- Depilatory cream acts by separating the hair from the follicles. Hair regrowth can begin within a few days of treatment. This method is best used for weekly hair removal or in combination with laser treatment. Contact dermatitis (allergic and irritant) can occur with the use of this product because of the alkaline nature as well as the added fragrances. Some find the product messy and the odour offensive, which limits its use.​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)

Laser systems and intense pulsed light sources (IPL) both work on the same principle, selectively targeting specific areas without affecting the surrounding tissue. Melanin pigment in the hair follicles absorbs the wavelength selected, effectively destroying the hair follicle via thermal damage and impairing future hair growth.​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)

- A Cochrane review that examined studies of laser and IPL procedures concluded that permanent hair removal is not a realistic expectation.​[[23]](#psc1162n1009) More realistically, long-term stable reduction in hair regrowth lasting 4–12 months can be accomplished with these procedures.​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)​[[23]](#psc1162n1009) Side effects can include mild to moderate pain, skin redness, pigment changes and burned hairs. These side effects are dependent on the type of laser used for treatment.​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)
- **Topical anesthetics** containing lidocaine and prilocaine are commonly used prior to laser treatment to decrease pain from the procedure. Consumers may apply these products in larger amounts and to a larger area than is recommended, increasing the risk of serious side effects,​[[24]](#psc1162n1011) such as CNS toxicity, methemoglobinemia and cardiovascular collapse. Systemic effects may manifest as headache, drowsiness, respiratory depression, confusion, convulsions, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias.​[[24]](#psc1162n1011)
- Laser and IPL treatments are expensive and must be administered by a trained professional. Initial treatment usually involves a number of sessions and occasional follow-up treatments may be needed to maintain hair removal. A number of hand-held, home-use laser and light devices can be purchased for personal use. Non-industry–sponsored evidence of safety and effectiveness is not available.​[[16]](#HessionMTMarkovaAGraberEM.AReviewOf-8EC3AC1C)

Electrolysis is an option for the removal of unwanted hair. A small needle or metal probe is inserted into the hair follicle and low-level electrical current is used to destroy the follicle. This is a time-consuming method that has some pain and risk of scarring associated with it. It is important that the procedure be performed by a trained and certified professional. The designations CPE (Certified Professional Electrologist) and CCE (Certified Canadian Electrologist) indicate the electrologist has satisfied a board of examiners and is a member in good standing.

Bleaching lightens hair so that it is not as noticeable. Several products are available; all contain hydrogen peroxide and many contain ammonia (accelerates the bleaching action). Bleaching is fast, generally painless and reserved for small areas. Results can last up to 4 weeks. Side effects include skin irritation and hair discoloration.​[[22]](#psc1162n1010)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

### Hair Loss

Information about medications used in the management of hair loss can also be found in [Table 4](#d2e1284).

#### Topical Therapy for Hair Loss

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Hair Growth.

Minoxidil has been shown to be effective for the treatment of male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss.​[[13]](#VanZuurenEFedorowiczZSchoonesJ.Inte-5B3DF960)​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4) The mechanism of action of minoxidil is unclear but it is thought to stimulate the conversion of small hair follicles to larger follicles. Minoxidil prolongs the duration of the anagen phase and increases hair count and weight.​[[27]](#psc1162n1012)​[[28]](#psc1162n01035) Minoxidil has also shown some benefits in the treatment of patients with traction alopecia who have not responded to nonpharmacological measures.​[[4]](#BilleroVMitevaM.TractionAlopeciaThe-C12F9199)​[[5]](#AkingbolaCOVyasJ.TractionAlopeciaAN-C1304C75)

Minoxidil 2% solution is approved for male-pattern hair loss only and minoxidil 5% foam is approved for both male- and female-pattern hair loss. Studies have not shown a difference in effectiveness between 2% and 5% products.​[[13]](#VanZuurenEFedorowiczZSchoonesJ.Inte-5B3DF960) Minoxidil is most effective when started early, prior to the area becoming completely bald. Hair growth is visible within 2 months or more, with a maximum effect within a year.​[[27]](#psc1162n1012)​[[29]](#psc1162n01036) Daily application is required indefinitely to maintain hair growth.​[[1]](#psc1162n1001) Transitory increased hair shedding may occur during the first 1–2 months of treatment due to telogen (resting phase) follicles being stimulated to re-enter anagen (growing phase). Patients should be advised that this may occur and that it will normalize within a few weeks to months.​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)

The most common side effect of minoxidil is contact dermatitis at the application site, which is possibly caused by propylene glycol. Compounding minoxidil using butylene glycol instead of propylene glycol may decrease this side effect.​[[30]](#FriedmanESFriedmanPMCohenDEEtAl.All-5B4698F0)​[[31]](#psc1162n1013) Minoxidil 5% foam formulation is propylene glycol–free, causes less scalp irritation and improves adherence.​[[32]](#psc1162n1014) This formulation is more cosmetically pleasing as it is less greasy, and it is easier to apply to the scalp only and avoid the hair. Systemic absorption of minoxidil is minimal but tachycardia and decreased blood pressure have been reported. Use caution when recommending this treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease or low blood pressure.​[[27]](#psc1162n1012) Although systemic absorption of topical minoxidil is minimal, safety in pregnancy has not been established and it is not recommended.​[[33]](#psc1162n01031) Transfer of topically applied minoxidil into breast milk is expected to be minimal and poses low risk to the nursing infant.​[[34]](#psc1162n01032)

#### Systemic Therapy for Hair Loss

Finasteride halts or reverses the progression of mild to moderate hair loss in men by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase–mediated conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4) It has been shown to reduce hair loss in 80–90% of those treated and improve hair growth in approximately 50%. Regular daily use for 3–6 months may be required to see reduced hair loss and up to 12 months to see noticeable regrowth. Hair loss resumes when therapy is stopped. The most common side effects experienced by men using finasteride are decreased libido, decreased semen volume and erectile dysfunction. These side effects may decrease with continued treatment and may or may not be reversible when treatment is discontinued. Finasteride may reduce prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by up to 50% depending on the dose and age of the patient. This should be considered when interpreting PSA levels in patients taking finasteride.​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)​[[35]](#FinasterideInDermNetNZ.AvailableAtH-91EF9A28)​[[36]](#RossiAAnzaloneAFortunaMCEtAl.Multi--5FE05DA8) Evidence for use of finasteride in females is limited and conflicting. Finasteride should never be used or handled by women who are pregnant or may become pregnant as it may cause developmental genital defects in the male fetus.​[[13]](#VanZuurenEFedorowiczZSchoonesJ.Inte-5B3DF960) Since finasteride concentration in semen is very low, there is no risk to a fetus via intercourse.​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)

Another 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, has also been shown to be effective in male androgenetic alopecia​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)​[[36]](#RossiAAnzaloneAFortunaMCEtAl.Multi--5FE05DA8)​[[37]](#TsunemiYIrisawaRYoshiieHEtAl.Long-t-5B415972) but is not officially indicated for this condition and requires further research. Side effects and precautions are similar to those for finasteride.

Hormone therapy with **combined oral contraceptives**, cyproterone, drospirenone, flutamide and spironolactone has been studied for female-pattern hair loss. Evidence is sparse and of limited quality and therefore no recommendations can be made.​[[13]](#VanZuurenEFedorowiczZSchoonesJ.Inte-5B3DF960)​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)

Combining therapies may help increase efficacy. Combinations that have been studied include finasteride plus minoxidil,​[[26]](#BlumeyerATostiAMessengerAEtAl.Evide-91786EA4)​[[38]](#JiuRXuFShengYEtAl.CombinedTreatment-92607878) finasteride plus ketoconazole shampoo (may help reduce androgenetic alopecia–associated follicular inflammation and is also an anti-androgen),​[[39]](#KhanpurSSumanMReddyBSEtAl.Comparati-9260EAA2) and topical or systemic therapy in combination with transplant procedures.

In the specific case of alopecia areata, many treatments have been tried with varying success. These include topical minoxidil; topical, oral and locally injected corticosteroids; anthralin; azelaic acid; methotrexate; and topical sensitizers such as dinitrochlorobenzene or diphenylcyclopropenone (to stimulate an immune response).​[[40]](#HordinskyMDonatiA.AlopeciaAreataAnd-04B719C5)​[[41]](#SpanoFDonovanJC.AlopeciaAreataPart2-04B75154)​[[42]](#PhanKRamachandranVSebaratnamDF.Meth-C133C6D5) For information on chemotherapy-induced hair loss, see Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy.

#### Emerging Systemic Therapies for Hair Loss

Research on emerging therapies is primarily focused on androgenetic alopecia as it is the most common type of hair loss. Systemic treatments under investigation include platelet-rich plasma injections and cytokine injections, which contain growth factors thought to stimulate the hair follicles. Nutraceuticals from food sources are also being studied as a means of targeting possible causes of hair loss (including stress and inflammation). Evidence is limited for all of these therapies.​[[43]](#SadickNS.New-generationTherapiesFor-5FE10E04) See also [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1162n00009).

### Excessive Hair Growth in Women

Information about medications used in the management of excessive hair growth can also be found in [Table 5](#d2e1182).

Hormonal treatments for hirsutism either suppress androgen levels or block the effects of androgens on hair follicles. First-line therapy for hirsutism unless contraindicated is combination oral contraceptives (COCs).​[[17]](#LiuKMotanTClamanP.No.350x2013Hiruti-C1333C0D) Those containing ethinyl estradiol and a minimally androgenic progestogen (e.g., desogestrel, norgestimate) can slow progression but not reverse excess hair growth and generally require 9–12 months for maximal effect. COCs containing the antiandrogens cyproterone **acetate** or drospirenone are also effective and may be preferred.​[[6]](#psc1162n1003)​[[18]](#SomaniNTurvyD.HirsutismAnEvidence-b-950EEDF4)​[[19]](#psc1162n1008)​[[45]](#VanZuurenEJFedorowiczZCarterBEtAl.I-9484B727) The antiandrogens spironolactone, flutamide and cyproterone  **acetate** are also effective. These agents have been used as monotherapy but are generally recommended in addition to COCs for moderate to severe hirsutism that has not responded to COCs alone.​[[17]](#LiuKMotanTClamanP.No.350x2013Hiruti-C1333C0D)​[[18]](#SomaniNTurvyD.HirsutismAnEvidence-b-950EEDF4)​[[45]](#VanZuurenEJFedorowiczZCarterBEtAl.I-9484B727) Finasteride has shown inconsistent results in studies​[[45]](#VanZuurenEJFedorowiczZCarterBEtAl.I-9484B727) but is considered a second-line antiandrogen by some experts.​[[18]](#SomaniNTurvyD.HirsutismAnEvidence-b-950EEDF4)​[[46]](#HohlARonsoniMFDeOliveiraM.Hirsutism-95F2FCE5) There is evidence that eflornithine cream reduces the rate of hair growth in women by suppressing the mitotic activity in the follicle.​[[45]](#VanZuurenEJFedorowiczZCarterBEtAl.I-9484B727)​[[47]](#JacksonJCaroJJCaroGEtAl.TheEffectOf-948CF6DA)​[[48]](#WolfJEShanderDHuberFEtAl.Randomized-948CE8C0) While it may be tried alone for mild cases,​[[18]](#SomaniNTurvyD.HirsutismAnEvidence-b-950EEDF4) it is generally recommended as adjunctive therapy with hair removal techniques such as laser therapy. Improvement is expected after 4–8 weeks of treatment but may take up to 24 weeks in some patients. Discontinuing use of the product results in hair regrowth within 8 weeks of stopping treatment.​[[19]](#psc1162n1008)

### Monitoring of Therapy

Monitoring plans for patients should be individualized; hair loss and its psychological effects are different for each person. The degree of hair loss (mild to moderate or severe) should also be considered when determining initial treatment and monitoring outcomes. [Table 3](#psc1162n00020) provides a monitoring plan framework for both hair loss and excessive growth.

**Table 3:** Monitoring of Therapy for Hair Conditions

| Symptom | Monitoring | Desired Outcome | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hair thinning | Monitor for improvement for a minimum of 6–12 months after treatment started. | Reduced thinning, slowed progression and improved scalp coverage. | Continue therapy indefinitely if patient satisfied with results. Patient must weigh benefits vs. cost of long-term treatment. |
| Excess hair shedding | Monitor for increased shedding for 2–8 wk after treatment started. Monitor for excess hair shedding (>300/day) for 1–3 months (possible diagnosis of telogen effluvium. See Pathophysiology ). | Normal rate of hair loss (75–100 hairs per day) within 4–6 months after treatment started. | If shedding does not resolve in 4–6 months after removal of trigger or beginning of therapy, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Excess hair growth | Monitor hair regrowth after removal. Shaving, waxing, plucking, bleaching, depilatories: monitor daily. Laser therapy and electrolysis procedures should be monitored for 4–12 months. | Cosmetically acceptable appearance. | Cosmetic management of excess hair is usually required. Topical anesthetics should be used with caution prior to laser treatment. Serious reactions should be assessed and/or treated appropriately. |
| Skin irritation from topical agents | Monitor daily for skin reactions to cosmetic treatment as well as topical treatment. | Minimal to no skin irritation. | Stop using product. Treat symptomatically with low-potency topical corticosteroids. |

**Drug Class: 5-Alpha-reductase Inhibitors**

| dutasteride Avodart , generics <$25 | 0.5 mg daily (some studies have used up to 2.5 mg daily) | Men: Decreased libido and semen volume, erectile dysfunction, headaches, dry skin. There is some concern that due to dutasteride's increased half-life compared with finasteride, side effects may potentially be more severe or long-lasting. | Combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir) may increase serum concentration of dutasteride. Monitor for increased adverse reactions, e.g., erectile dysfunction, decreased libido. | Not a Health Canada–approved use. No evidence for use in women (a few case reports only). |
| finasteride Propecia , generics $25–50 | 1 mg daily PO | Men: Decreased libido and semen volume, erectile dysfunction, headaches, dry skin, suicidal ideation (rare)​ [25] | No known clinically significant drug interactions. | Limited evidence for use in women. May cause developmental genital defects in the male fetus; contraindicated in pregnancy. Concentration in semen is very low: no risk to fetus via sexual contact of mother with a male taking finasteride. |
