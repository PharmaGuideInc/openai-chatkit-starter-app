### Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disturbance characterized by fasting and/or postprandial hyperglycemia. Rather than a single disease entity, diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous syndrome that is caused by an absolute or relative lack of insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both. Dysglycemia is a term that describes abnormal blood glucose levels without a definite threshold. The term reflects current evidence that minor degrees of blood glucose abnormalities, even those that do not meet the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus, are still associated with increased cardiovascular risk.​[[1]](#c0079n00045)

Long-term diabetes mellitus may lead to complications that involve the small blood vessels (microvascular) and large blood vessels (macrovascular) of multiple organs and systems. Because diabetes is associated with significant dysfunction of numerous metabolic pathways, clinicians must pay close attention to factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia in addition to blood glucose. Heart disease is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes.​[[2]](#c0079n00617)

### Classification

*Type 1* diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is due to autoimmune beta cell destruction resulting in an absolute deficiency of insulin. T1DM usually presents with acute metabolic symptoms of relatively short duration in a child, adolescent or young adult. If left untreated, ketoacidosis may occur. Although onset of T1DM is less common after 30 years of age, some older individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus may develop markers of autoimmunity and progress quickly to an insulin-dependent state. This late autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is considered a variation of T1DM, and variable titres of islet cell or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoantibodies are detectable. In North America, T1DM accounts for 5–10% of all patients with diabetes. Studies have revealed that both incidence and prevalence of T1DM are increasing worldwide.​[[3]](#MobasseriMShirmohammadiMAmiriTEtAl.-996400EA)​[[4]](#ThunanderMPeterssonCJonzonKEtAl.Inc-996433AD)

*Type 2* diabetes mellitus (T2DM) manifests primarily as insulin resistance along with some degree of insulin deficiency. Over time, insulin deficiency worsens, resulting in more prominent hyperglycemia. T2DM is commonly discovered incidentally or in adults presenting to their primary care provider who have nonspecific symptoms. T2DM makes up 90% of all cases of diabetes mellitus and the prevalence is rising rapidly, particularly in certain ethnic groups, both in Canada and worldwide. It is also being diagnosed more frequently and earlier in adolescents and in children living with obesity.

*Gestational* diabetes is defined as first onset or recognition of glucose intolerance during pregnancy.

Other specific causes of diabetes mellitus include the monogenetic syndromes such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or are a result of pancreatic diseases (type 3c), infectious agents, drugs, pancreatic surgery or other diseases leading to carbohydrate intolerance. Drugs that can perturb blood glucose levels and interfere with glycemic control in patients with diabetes are presented in [Table 1](#table-19351-E114AF63).

**Table 1:** Examples of Drugs That Can Cause Dysglycemia​[[a]](#Medication-inducedDysglycemiaShould-E1144DD5)

| 5-flurouracil Beta-blockers Checkpoint inhibitors, e.g., ipilimumab, pembrolizumab Corticosteroids Diazoxide HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) Immunosuppressive agents, e.g., everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, temsirolimus Interferon alfa Isoniazid Niacin Pasireotide Pentamidine Protease inhibitors Second-generation antipsychotic agents, e.g., olanzapine,quetiapine, risperidone Thiazide or loop diuretics |

[a] Medication-induced dysglycemia should not preclude the use of these medications if clinically indicated.

### Goals of Therapy

- Alleviate symptoms of hyperglycemia
- Establish and maintain glycemic control while avoiding hypoglycemia
- Prevent or minimize the risk of acute and chronic complications
- Achieve optimal control of associated risk factors such as hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia

### Investigations

- Diabetes mellitus may present in a variety of settings:

  - asymptomatic; incidental discovery through routine laboratory screening (see [Figure 1](#c0079n00005))
  - nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, lassitude, weight changes
  - presence of diabetic macrovascular or microvascular complications including neuropathy, kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, vision changes
  - acute metabolic symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss
  - diabetic ketoacidosis
- The diagnosis of diabetes in Canada is established by:​[[5]](#c0079n00288)

  - a random plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (random is defined as any time of day without regard to the interval since the last meal) *or*
  - a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥7 mmol/L (fasting is defined as no caloric intake for ≥8 h) *or*
  - a plasma glucose level ≥11.1 mmol/L 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose load (oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) *or*
  - an HbA1c ≥6.5% (in adults) using a standardized, validated assay, in the absence of conditions that affect the accuracy of the HbA1c, e.g., anemias, hemodialysis, pregnancy; ​[[6]](#c0079n00574) should not be the only test used for suspected T1DM

In the absence of clinical symptoms of hyperglycemia, confirm the diagnosis with a repeat test performed on another day;​[[5]](#c0079n00288) with the exception of a random plasma glucose, the same test should be used to confirm the initial result.

### Screening

Screening for T1DM is not recommended in individuals with normal glucose levels. While the autoantibodies thought to contribute to the destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells can be detected prior to disease, their presence does not guarantee that diabetes will occur. Although there are no long-term preventive therapies for T1DM, recent advancements have been made. For instance, teplizumab is a disease-modifying therapy that was recently approved to delay the onset of stage 3 T1DM from stage 2 T1DM in patients ≥8 years of age.

Diabetes Canada recommends screening for T2DM every 3 years in individuals over 40 years of age or those determined to be high risk using a validated tool such as [CANRISK](https://health.canada.ca/apps/canrisk-standalone/pdf/canrisk-en.pdf) by testing either FPG or HbA1c.​[[7]](#c0079n00456)​[[8]](#c0079n00575) Earlier and more frequent testing should be considered in individuals at a higher risk (see [Table 2](#c0079n00016)).​[[9]](#c0079n00044)

**Table 2:** Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus​[[7]](#c0079n00456)

| Age ≥40 y First-degree relative with T2DM Member of high-risk population, e.g., Indigenous, Hispanic, South Asian, Asian, African, low socioeconomic status​ [a] History of prediabetes, e.g., IFG, IGT, HbA 1c 6–6.4% History of gestational diabetes mellitus History of delivery of a macrosomic infant Presence of end-organ damage associated with diabetes, e.g., cardiovascular, microvascular Presence of vascular risk factors: abdominal obesity​ [b] HDL cholesterol <1 mmol/L in males or <1.3 mmol/L in females​ [b] ​ [c] hypertension​ [b] overweight​ [b] triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/L​ [b] smoking Presence of associated diseases: acanthosis nigricans​ [b] cystic fibrosis history of pancreatitis HIV infection hyperuricemia/gout metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis obstructive sleep apnea polycystic ovary syndrome​ [b] psychiatric disorders, e.g., bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia |

[a] This risk factor reflects the data on which the guideline was based. CPhA is aware that while there may be some biological bases for increased risk, it may also reflect social, economic or health inequities. Targeting treatment to at-risk groups appropriately, however, may improve patient outcomes.

### Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

### Therapeutic Choices

Depending on the presentation and clinical circumstances, diabetes mellitus may be initially treated with nonpharmacologic choices (such as diet and exercise) or pharmacologic choices. Whereas a presentation indicative of T1DM necessitates initiation of insulin, a presentation indicative of T2DM may require initiation of insulin, other antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy or lifestyle modifications alone.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

As a chronic condition, diabetes mellitus is largely self-managed. Pivotal to self-management is integrating nonpharmacologic interventions in the management of both T1DM and T2DM. The use of a flow chart may be helpful to ensure important interventions are not overlooked (see Appendix 3 at [https://guidelines.diabetes.ca](https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/appendices/appendix3) for an example).

- *Self-management education* is vital in making patients full participants in the diabetes health-care delivery team and ensuring that they can effectively and safely manage their disease. People living with diabetes should be educated on:

  - A basic understanding of diabetes
  - The role of diet, exercise and medications
  - How and when to self-monitor glucose and interpretation of the results
  - The management of sick days
  - Recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia
  - Care of the feet
  - Awareness of heart health and the importance of risk-factor control, including body weight and smoking cessation
  - Awareness of other organs (e.g., eyes, kidneys) that may be affected and the importance of appropriate follow-up
- *Nutritional management*. Dietary choices are a critical aspect of managing diabetes mellitus. Counselling should ideally be provided by a registered dietitian who can help personalize goals and provide a tailored dietary plan. If patients are overweight, total caloric reduction strategies may be incorporated into an overall strategy (if appropriate) to help improve metabolic control and reduce the risks associated with overweight and obesity. For patients on insulin, tailor the distribution of food intake into meals and snacks according to the individual’s preference in a manner that will be safe; carbohydrate intake and insulin dose must be linked. Options include advising patients to adjust carbohydrate consumption or count the amount of carbohydrate ingested and adjust the insulin dose accordingly (see also Special Diets).
- *Exercise*. Physical activity can improve cardiovascular function, enhance insulin sensitivity, and lower BP and lipid levels.​[[10]](#c0079n00459) Physical activity also helps improve glycemic control in people with T2DM.​[[10]](#c0079n00459) Some patients (e.g., history of angina) should be evaluated by a physician prior to engaging in vigorous exercise to ensure it is safe to do so. In those in whom exercise is safe, encourage aerobic exercise totalling ≥150 minutes per week along with resistance training at least twice a week.​[[10]](#c0079n00459) It is imperative to educate patients treated with insulin about the effect of exercise on glucose levels and how to adjust the insulin dosage accordingly. Predictable intensity and duration allow individuals to understand how glucose levels will change immediately following the exercise. Typically, glucose levels will decrease after moderate-intensity exercise but may increase after intense activity. Teach patients how to time their meals and/or regulate food consumption to ensure the safety of the prescribed exercise regimen.
- *Glucose monitoring*. Performing capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an essential component of the overall management of diabetes mellitus for the majority of patients. They are tools that allow appropriate recognition of low blood glucose levels and provide immediate feedback about the effects of therapy. CBG involves checking blood glucose levels via a finger prick, whereas CGM measures the glucose concentration in interstitial fluid via a sensor/device that is attached and replaced every 10 to 14 days.

  - CBG and CGM are particularly important in patients using insulin. In these patients, individualized self-monitoring strategies should be employed and will ideally consist of both pre- and postprandial measurements. A minimum of 3 blood sugar measurements per day should be performed for those on basal-bolus insulin regimens.​[[11]](#c0079n00291) CBG may be preferred for individuals without insurance coverage when cost is a concern or in those who are used to performing CBG and have adequate glucose control. On the other hand, CGM offers the benefit of providing continuous glucose data over 24 hours without an invasive finger prick and has been shown to be able to improve glycemic control.​[[11]](#c0079n00291)
  - For those who are not being managed on insulin (other antihyperglycemic medications or lifestyle alone), the benefits and optimal timing and frequency of CBG are much less clear. The frequency and duration of CBG monitoring in these patients must be individualized and should be based on factors such as type of antihyperglycemic agent, risk of hypoglycemia, presence of concurrent illness, and the need to evaluate the effectiveness of new medications or dosage changes. For some examples, see [Appendix 5](https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/appendices/appendix5) of the Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines.​[[12]](#DiabetesCanada2018ClinicalPracticeG-99675A09) CGM can also be used in people living with diabetes if they desire more information on their glucose control or by preference.
  - In addition to monitoring real-time glucose values via CBG or CGM, people living with diabetes should have HbA1c measurements performed every 3 months if target values are not achieved; testing every 6 months may be acceptable in stable patients who consistently meet glycemic targets.​[[11]](#c0079n00291)
- *Ongoing monitoring* of other organ systems, including directed histories and physical examinations, are intended to detect comorbidities and complications. These assessments should include:

  - BP measurements at all appropriate visits.​[[13]](#c0079n00514)
  - Foot examinations annually. The [Diabetes Canada](https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/appendices/appendix12) clinical practice guidelines provide a guidance document on monofilament testing.​[[14]](#DiabetesCanada2018ClinicalPracticeG-9967BEB1) Refer patients at high risk of foot ulceration or amputation and those with existing ulcers to a health-care provider trained in foot-care management.​[[15]](#c0079n00515)
  - Serum creatinine and random urine albumin-creatinine ratio once a year to screen for chronic kidney disease, and at regular intervals in those with established kidney disease.​[[16]](#c0079n00576)
  - Lipid profile (either fasting or non-fasting) at the time of diagnosis and then annually if results are normal initially.​[[17]](#c0079n00577) More frequent testing (every 3–6 months) should occur if treatment is initiated.​[[18]](#c0079n00578)
  - Referral to a specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist) for an eye examination using dilated fundoscopy or wide-angle stereoscopic retinal photography at the time of diagnosis in patients with T2DM and 5 years after diagnosis in patients with T1DM ≥15 years of age. Repeat annually in T1DM and every 1–2 years in T2DM if initially normal.​[[19]](#c0079n00579) If retinopathy is present, follow-up is required at regular intervals.
- *Immunize* patients with diabetes to reduce the risk of complications and hospitalization. In adults, annual influenza immunization is recommended.​[[20]](#c0079n00519) Diabetes Canada also recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all people living with T1DM or T2DM.​[[21]](#DiabetesCanada.AnOpenLetterToOurDia-9968A8EB) Consult [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-adults.html#a3) guidelines for other vaccine-preventable diseases that should also be considered.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Type 1 Diabetes

Insulin may be administered by syringe, pen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump). Although insulins from animal sources are still marketed in Canada, most patients use human insulin and insulin analogues since these agents cause less antibody generation and related adverse reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, insulin resistance). Human insulins are produced by recombinant DNA technology and have an amino acid sequence identical to endogenous human insulin. Insulin analogues are slightly modified human insulin molecules (see [Table 3](#table-12044234-85CD53DD) and [Table 8](#c0079n00023)).

The rapid-acting insulin analogues (RAIAs) insulin aspart, insulin glulisine and insulin lispro allow for more flexibility to control postprandial glucose because of their faster onset of action compared with short-acting insulins. There is a concentrated 200 units/mL version of insulin lispro available, which allows a reduced volume to be injected in those requiring large doses with each meal (>20 units). Additionally, a faster-acting insulin aspart is available, which appears in the bloodstream approximately twice as fast as the original insulin aspart formulation, has superior postprandial blood glucose control and is noninferior with respect to HbA1c.​[[22]](#HeiseTHxf6velmannUBrxf8ndstedLEtAl.-A4E603B2)

The long-acting insulin analogues (LAIAs) insulin degludec, insulin detemir and insulin glargine exhibit a flatter profile and more predictable effects than intermediate-acting human insulin (NPH) and are associated with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia.​[[23]](#c0079n00460) In a meta-analysis, patients with T1DM who used LAIAs for a year had significantly fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to using NPH (NNT = 20 to prevent 1 episode).​[[24]](#c0079n00292) Insulin glargine is available in different formulations, including a concentrated 300 units/mL product. This concentrated formulation appears to have a longer duration of action, has no peak effect and further reduces hypoglycemia compared to glargine 100 units/mL.​[[25]](#BeckerRHDahmenRBergmannKEtAl.NewIns-A4E68C98) Insulin degludec is available in 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL strengths and has a duration of action of approximately 42 hours.​[[26]](#c0079n00580) Compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL, it was shown to be as effective in controlling glucose, with a 26% relative risk reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia.​[[27]](#c0079n00581) A once-weekly long-acting insulin analogue is also available. Data from the ONWARDS trials show that treatment with once-weekly insulin icodec was at least noninferior for change in HbA1c from baseline when compared with daily insulin glargine or insulin degludec in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.​[[28]](#RosenstockJBajajHSJanezAEtAl.Once-W-99724294)​[[29]](#ClinicalTrials.gov.AResearchStudyTo-99742785)​[[30]](#LingvayIAsongMDesouzaCEtAl.Once-wee-497DCA30)​[[31]](#MathieuCAsbjornsdottirBBajajH-497DF8CF)​[[32]](#BajajHSAberleJDaviesMEtAl.Once-wWee-497E3DCC)​[[33]](#Russell-JonesDBabazonoTCailleteauRE-497E5B71)

| insulin icodec (Awiqli) | 15–18 h | Flat, no discernible peak | 7 days |

### Insulin Regimens

Although an in-depth discussion about the different types of insulin regimens is beyond the scope of this chapter, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that intensive treatment regimens control blood glucose more effectively than conventional regimens and reduce the risk of long-term diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy).​[[34]](#c0079n00047) Follow-up data from the trial demonstrate a long-term benefit of intensive therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.​[[35]](#c0079n00295) Newly diagnosed patients and those with poor glycemic control on conventional regimens should be offered the option of intensive diabetes management consisting of multiple-dose insulin (MDI) regimens (see [Table 4](#table-1184424341-E11ADE2C)). It is essential to assess each patient to determine whether an intensive regimen is a suitable option. Less intensive regimens may be a better choice in frail older patients, unmotivated patients or those who lack awareness of severe hypoglycemia. In clinical practice, a rapid-acting insulin analogue (RAIA) in combination with a long-acting insulin analogue (LAIA) is preferred over regular insulin in order to minimize risk of hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c and postprandial glucose levels.​[[36]](#c0079n00582)​[[37]](#c0079n00583)

Most lean patients with T1DM require approximately 0.5 units of insulin per kilogram of body mass. In the first few months following a T1DM diagnosis, patients may experience periods where the requirement for insulin is decreased or transiently eliminated. This phenomenon is known as the honeymoon phase. Insulin therapy should be initiated judiciously in order to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and adjusted every 2–3 days according to glucose results. Regular home monitoring allows patients to adjust the dose of insulin in response to abnormal blood glucose levels, effects of diet and exercise, and changing glucose patterns. Optimal glucose control is achieved by matching the timing of insulin injections with caloric intake: regular insulin is given approximately 30 minutes before meals and RAIAs should ideally be administered 0–15 minutes prior to starting a meal, although they can be administered up to 15 minutes (and 20 min for faster aspart) after the start of a meal.

The use of insulin pumps and regimens involving multiple doses of RAIA (vs. regular human insulin) improves the stability of postprandial glucose levels and may also diminish the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, especially early nocturnal hypoglycemia. In addition, insulin pumps can achieve a tighter and more reproducible degree of glycemic control, particularly in those with a high initial HbA1c. However, there is a significantly increased cost for the patient, so the decision to use a pump will depend on patient preference. For a more detailed description of the use of insulin pumps see Diabetes Care Devices.

### Adverse Effects of Insulin Therapy

- *Hypoglycemia* is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy and occurs more frequently in patients aiming for tight control of glucose levels.

  - Hypoglycemia is most commonly the result of either a missed meal or an unusual amount of exercise. Frequent hypoglycemic events may lead to reduced autonomic symptoms (*hypoglycemia unawareness*). Teach patients to account for diet and physical activity when planning insulin treatment regimens to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
  - Symptoms of hypoglycemia are generally characterized as either:

    - adrenergic—hunger, sweating, tremors, tachycardia, nausea and a general sensation of weakness *or*
    - neuroglycopenic—confusion, altered behaviour, difficulty speaking and concentrating, and drowsiness

    Typically, the adrenergic symptoms will present first.
  - The International Hypoglycemia Study Group divides hypoglycemia into 3 different levels according to the severity of symptoms and degree of risk. *Level 1* hypoglycemia is characterized by a blood glucose level between 3.0 and 3.9 mmol/L with accompanying adrenergic symptoms but without neuroglycopenic symptoms. *Level 2* often presents with glucose levels <3.0 mmol/L and neuroglycopenic symptoms (without significant cognitive impact). *Level 3* is characterized by any low glucose value with neuroglycopenic symptoms and impaired physical or cognitive status that requires assistance in treatment.​[[38]](#LegaICYaleJ-FSeniorPEtAl.Hypoglycem-49ECB53A)
  - *Level 1* and *2* hypoglycemia can be self-treated with an oral source of sugar. Fifteen grams of glucose (e.g., 3/4 cup of juice or regular soft drink, or 6 Life Savers) will usually raise the blood glucose approximately 2 mmol/L within 20 minutes. Glucose gel is not a preferred treatment option; it must be swallowed for significant effect, and the blood glucose response is very slow.​[[38]](#LegaICYaleJ-FSeniorPEtAl.Hypoglycem-49ECB53A)
  - *Level 3* hypoglycemia may be treated with 20 grams of oral glucose if the patient is conscious and able to swallow, preferably as glucose tablets or equivalent. If oral glucose is not an option because of choking risk, then glucagon should be administered, either as 1 mg IM or SC injection, or 3 mg nasal powder (for patients ≥4 y) and emergency services contacted immediately.​[[38]](#LegaICYaleJ-FSeniorPEtAl.Hypoglycem-49ECB53A) Once conscious, patients should consume a fast-acting sugar source followed by food as soon as possible. Each route of administration effectively raises blood glucose within 15–30 minutes; however, caregivers, acquaintances and patients tend to prefer the intranasal formulation due to its ease of use.​[[39]](#Singh-FrancoDMoreauCLevinADEtAl.Eff-997443F8)
  - Assess specifically for *hypoglycemia unawareness* and use strategies to recover awareness, such as relaxing glycemic targets for up to 3 months and increasing patient self-monitoring of glucose levels.​[[40]](#c0079n00584)​[[41]](#c0079n00585)
- *Localized fat hypertrophy* (lipohypertrophy) is most often the result of frequent use of the same injection site. This results in low or unpredictable absorption of insulin from that site and in some cases disfigurement. All patients should be educated about the need to rotate injection sites in a systematic fashion.
- *Allergic reactions*, such as urticaria, angioedema, rashes and local erythema, are rare with human insulin. If they do occur, switching to a different insulin manufacturer may help.
- Immune-mediated *insulin resistance* due to the production of anti-insulin antibodies is also rare with human insulin. Patients who have developed immune-mediated resistance to animal insulins should be switched to human insulin. Reduce the dose substantially at the initiation of the switch. Concentrated regular insulin, 500 units/mL, may be useful in the treatment of patients requiring very large doses of insulin.

### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Initial management of patients with T2DM generally depends on the HbA1c, clinical symptoms and concomitant disease states, as described below.​[[42]](#ShahBRBajajHSButaliaSEtAl.Pharmacol-95320303)

Upon diagnosis, the decision may be made through a shared decision-making process to attempt treatment with nonpharmacologic therapy alone (e.g., diet and exercise). However, if glycemic targets are not achieved within 3 months, then pharmacotherapy should be initiated. Once the decision to initiate medications is made, metformin is the drug of choice for initiation either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic medication if it is unreasonable to expect desired control with metformin monotherapy (HbA1c >1.5% above target). If individuals present at diagnosis with concomitant disease states such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), kidney disease or heart failure, additional pharmacotherapy options with proven cardiorenal protective effects should also be initiated (see [Figure 2](#c0079n00006)). In those patients who are exhibiting extremely high glucose levels at presentation, are very symptomatic or are exhibiting signs of metabolic decompensation, initiation with insulin with or without metformin should occur.

For those patients newly diagnosed with diabetes, the goal is to reach the desired HbA1c target within 3–6 months through dosage titration or the addition of other agents (see [Figure 2](#c0079n00006), [Table 9](#c0079n00043)). Typically, the higher the baseline HbA1c, the greater the reduction in HbA1c that can be achieved with treatment.​[[43]](#c0079n00354) After metformin, the drug chosen as the second-line agent should be individualized, taking into consideration presence of clinical cardiovascular disease, kidney function, heart failure, hypoglycemia, weight concerns, cost and insurance coverage, amongst others.

Vascular protection is a significant goal in the management of diabetes (see [Targets for Control](#c0079n00018)). This may also include benefit specific to the kidney, so it is sometimes referred to as cardiorenal protection. In 2008 the FDA began requiring cardiovascular safety trials as part of the approval process for new medications for T2DM. None of the cardiovascular outcome trials initiated since 2008 have demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular events, and some trials have found a reduction in CV events. Diabetes Canada, along with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends that the results of cardiovascular safety trials be considered when selecting medications for the treatment of T2DM.​[[42]](#ShahBRBajajHSButaliaSEtAl.Pharmacol-95320303)​[[44]](#AmericanDiabetesAssociation.Standar-9981D1DE)​[[45]](#BuseJ.B.WexlerD.J.TsapasA.EtAl.2019-9B822B33)

### Biguanides

Metformin is generally considered the first choice for individuals with T2DM and should be used unless unmanageable adverse effects occur or contraindications are present. It decreases hepatic glucose production and may lower glucose absorption and enhance insulin-mediated glucose uptake. It is not associated with weight gain, it lowers HbA1c by approximately 1–1.5%, and the risk of hypoglycemia is low when it is used as monotherapy. However, it can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of insulin and sulfonylureas. Although the use of metformin has traditionally been discouraged due to the perceived risk of lactic acidosis in patients with heart failure, renal or hepatic disease, or hypoxemic states, a Cochrane review of 347 studies comparing over 70 000 subjects found no increase in the rate of lactic acidosis among patients receiving metformin compared with controls receiving other antihyperglycemic agents.​[[46]](#c0079n00461) Metformin may reduce CV risk,​[[47]](#c0079n00290) is considered safe to use in stable heart failure and liver disease, and reduced doses can be used with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min. Metformin should be withheld if a person is acutely ill and is unable to maintain fluid intake, and is also held if eGFR <30 mL/min and imaging-contrast agents are being given due to the possibility of acute renal failure, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.​[[48]](#AmericanCollegeOfRadiology.ACRManua-89C411E1)

### Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors

Acarbose inhibits intestinal alpha-glucosidases, resulting in delayed digestion of starches and disaccharides and reduced postprandial glucose levels. It does not significantly inhibit intestinal lactase. Acarbose does not cause hypoglycemia but can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues and causes significant GI effects. In addition, it requires TID dosing and is effective only if taken with a meal; hence, it should be taken with the first bite of a meal. Its effects on HbA1c are relatively modest; it can be expected to lower HbA1c by ≤1%. Because the digestion of sucrose is impaired by acarbose, hypoglycemia in patients taking acarbose should be treated with glucose rather than sucrose. In the Acarbose Cardiovascular Evaluation (ACE) trial, acarbose did not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among Chinese patients with established heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance.​[[49]](#HolmanRRColemanRLChanJCNEtAl.Effect-9974C2DE)

### Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors

Endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) to an inactive state. DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin and sitagliptin) increase the availability of GLP-1 as well as other potentially active peptides involved in glucose homeostasis.​[[50]](#c0079n00389) Overall, they lower HbA1c by ≤1% and are well tolerated medications with low risk of hypoglycemia. Although the SAVOR-TIMI trial showed an increase in hospitalization for heart failure with saxagliptin,​[[51]](#SciricaBMBhattDLBraunwaldEEtAl.Saxa-DDFE03B2) this has not been noted with other medications in this class. The cardiovascular outcome trials that have been performed have shown that these drugs do not alter CV risk.​[[47]](#c0079n00290)

### Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists mimic the actions of GLP-1, an endogenous incretin hormone. GLP-1 is secreted in response to food ingestion by endocrine cells found in the GI tract.​[[52]](#c0079n00388) Once released into the circulation, GLP-1 increases insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion during the postprandial period, slows gastric emptying and increases satiety,​[[50]](#c0079n00389) resulting in better control of glucose levels as well as weight loss. Whereas DPP-4 inhibitors can provide a physiologic increase in GLP-1, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (or GLP1RAs) provide a pharmacologic increase, which results in improved HbA1c lowering along with GI side effects, in particular nausea upon initiation. GLP1RAs are available in subcutaneous (dulaglutide, liraglutide, semaglutide) and oral (**semaglutide**) formulations, and can decrease HbA1c by approximately 1–1.5%. The injectable GLP1RAs are either administered daily (liraglutide) or weekly (dulaglutide, semaglutide) without regard to meals. There is also a short-acting GLP1RA, lixisenatide, which is available only as an injection in combination with insulin glargine. Oral semaglutide is taken daily on an empty stomach upon waking, with only minimal water and no other food, drink or medications for at least 30 minutes. Semaglutide has been associated with an increased rate of diabetic retinopathy complications compared to placebo in the SUSTAIN-6 trial; however, this is thought to be observed in those with poor glycemic control who experienced rapid improvements in HbA1c, particularly in those with pre-existing retinopathy.​[[53]](#CPSOnline.OttawaONCanadianPharmacis-E743C814)

Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) with liraglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide all showed a reduction in MACE.​[[54]](#MarsoSPDanielsGHBrownx2011FrandsenK-51003CD1)​[[55]](#MarsoSPBainSCConsoliAEtAl.Semagluti-BA899FE6)​[[56]](#GersteinHCColhounHMDagenaisGREtAl.D-99760EE9)​[[57]](#McGuireDKBusuiRPDeanfieldJEtAl.Effe-89C55E9D) These trials differ in their design, as participants in the liraglutide and subcutaneous semaglutide trials primarily had established ASCVD, whereas the majority of participants in the dulaglutide trial did not have ASCVD, but rather multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Although there is some evidence to suggest benefit in those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the evidence from clinical trials is more robust that these 3 GLP1RAs reduce the risk of MACE in those with evidence of ASCVD.

People living with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may derive renal benefits from the use of subcutaneous semaglutide. In the FLOW trial, the risk of clinically important kidney outcomes and death from CV causes was 24% lower in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group. This is the first prospective study showing renal benefits with a GLP1RA, and so it is unknown to date if this is specific to subcutaneous semaglutide or a class effect.​[[58]](#PerkovicVTuttleKRRossingPEtAl.Effec-49F6BB40)

### Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide lowers glucose levels by enhancing insulin secretion and reducing glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. It is a subcutaneous injection administered once weekly. As with GLP1RAs, it is recommended to titrate the dose up slowly in order to minimize the nausea that may occur as an adverse effect. Results from the SURPASS trials showed improved HbA1c  lowering as well as increased weight loss versus placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec and insulin glargine.​[[59]](#FriasJPDaviesMJRosenstockJEtAl.Tirz-910E0019)​[[60]](#LudvikBGiorginoFJodarEEtAl.Once-w-910E051C)​[[61]](#DelPratoSKahnSEPavoIEtAl.Tirzepatid-910E13B6) SURPASS-CVOT is an ongoing trial designed to assess the effect of tirzepatide versus dulaglutide on MACE in patients with T2DM and increased CV risk.​[[62]](#ClinicalTrials.gov.AStudyOfTirzepat-910E177E)

### Insulin Secretagogues: Sulfonylureas

The sulfonylureas (SUs) available in Canada are gliclazide, glimepiride and glyburide. They stimulate both basal and meal-stimulated insulin release and can lower HbA1c by 1–1.5%. There are differences between agents in regard to their adverse effect profiles. Glyburide is a second-generation SU that is associated with a greater risk of hypoglycemia than gliclazide and glimepiride,​[[63]](#c0079n00060) especially in older patients or those with renal impairment. Glyburide is also associated with more weight gain, although it can occur with any of these agents to varying degrees. SUs are considered as add-on options to metformin, or less often as monotherapy when metformin is contraindicated. They are often considered an option if the cost of therapy is a significant consideration. The CV safety of SUs is uncertain due to a lack of trial data. The CAROLINA trial showed that glimepiride was noninferior to linagliptin for the prevention of MACE.​[[64]](#RosenstockJKahnSEJohansenOEEtAl.Eff-9976805E)

### Insulin Secretagogues: Meglitinides

Repaglinide stimulates insulin release like the SUs, but activity is much shorter. Meglitinides need to be taken just prior to meals to reduce postprandial glucose elevations and should be omitted if the meal is missed. Repaglinide is expected to lower HbA1c to a similar extent as SUs and it is also considered to confer a lower risk of hypoglycemia in the context of missed meals (patients who skip meals could omit the associated repaglinide dose). FPG usually drops after about 1 month of regular use.​[[65]](#c0079n00057) It has been theorized that the greater effect on postprandial glucose compared with SUs would translate into a more favourable effect on cardiovascular outcomes; however, this benefit has not been established.​[[63]](#c0079n00060)

### Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) prevent glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased excretion of urinary glucose and a lowering of blood glucose.​[[66]](#c0079n00590) They are associated with weight loss, and their glucose-lowering ability is similar to that of other antihyperglycemic agents.​[[67]](#c0079n00591)​[[68]](#c0079n00592) However, their antihyperglycemic ability is diminished with lower glomerular filtration rates. The SGLT2 inhibitors cause a small decrease in BP, and they are associated with only a low risk of hypoglycemia. Side effects of note with this class of medications include mycotic genital infections, volume depletion-related adverse effects and some reports of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of lower extremity amputations and risk of fracture in the CANVAS trial, but this was not observed in the CREDENCE or OBSERVE-4D trials.​[[69]](#RyanPBBuseJBSchuemieMJEtAl.Comparat-99772058)​[[70]](#PerkovicVJardineMJNealBEtAl.Canagli-9977571C)

In cardiovascular outcome trials, a reduction in MACE was observed with empagliflozin and canagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials.​[[71]](#ZinmanBWannerCLachinJMEtAl.Empaglif-51002E71)​[[72]](#NealBPerkovicVMahaffeyKWEtAl.Canagl-BA897C50) EMPA-REG OUTCOME enrolled patients with known CVD, whereas the CANVAS program enrolled patients with and without CVD. DECLARE-TIMI 58 tested the CV safety of dapagliflozin in a majority of patients without CVD, and it met the criteria for noninferiority for MACE, but not superiority.​[[73]](#WiviottSDRazIBonacaMPEtAl.Dapaglifl-041EEBE4) These trials trended toward beneficial effects with respect to their use in heart failure and effects on kidney function, which led to subsequent clinical trials evaluating their use in these populations.

DAPA-HF randomized heart failure patients with or without diabetes to dapagliflozin or placebo, and dapagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of worsening HF, CV death and all-cause mortality.​[[47]](#c0079n00290)​[[74]](#McMurrayJJVSolomonSDInzucchiSEEtAl.-9978F7E8) Additionally, the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials randomized heart failure patients with or without diabetes to either empagliflozin or placebo, and empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure in participants with both reduced and preserved ejection fraction.​[[75]](#PackerMAnkerSDButlerJEtAl.Cardiovas-9979681E)​[[76]](#AnkerSDButlerJFilippatosGEtAl.Empag-49FA1C2C) Hence, the use of these agents is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or CV death.​[[42]](#ShahBRBajajHSButaliaSEtAl.Pharmacol-95320303)

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on the kidneys, slowing the increase in serum creatinine, reduction in eGFR and development of end-stage renal disease. Benefit was shown with all 3 SGLT2 inhibitors in the DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE and EMPA-KIDNEY trials. Hence, although the glycemic benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors is attenuated with a reduced eGFR, their continued use is recommended for their renal benefits.​[[42]](#ShahBRBajajHSButaliaSEtAl.Pharmacol-95320303)

### Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)

Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) receptors located on the cell nucleus. These medications influence gene expression in the cell leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity and lower levels of blood glucose and circulating insulin. The precise mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear.​[[77]](#c0079n00308) The TZDs also exhibit increased peripheral glucose uptake, enhanced fat cell sensitivity to insulin and decreased hepatic glucose output. The risk of hypoglycemia with TZDs is low when taken as monotherapy; however, they may enhance the hypoglycemic effects of insulin and SUs. The mean decrease in HbA1c is 1–1.5%. Individual TZDs may differ in their effects on serum lipids.​[[78]](#c0079n00462) Both agents are associated with weight gain due to increased subcutaneous fat deposition, fluid retention and edema, which is likely the cause of the increased incidence of heart failure in patients receiving TZDs.​[[77]](#c0079n00308)​[[79]](#c0079n00309) Other reported adverse effects include worsening macular edema​[[80]](#c0079n00310) and an increased risk of fractures, particularly of the hip and wrist.​[[81]](#c0079n00390)​[[82]](#c0079n00358) Although any link has not fully elucidated, pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.​[[83]](#c0079n00593) With increased interest in the association between diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), pioglitazone has been recognized as a medication that in addition to lowering glucose levels can also have a hepatic benefit.​[[44]](#AmericanDiabetesAssociation.Standar-9981D1DE)

The cardiovascular safety of thiazolidinediones is in question. Some analyses have reported an increase in the risk of ischemic events such as MI in patients receiving rosiglitazone,​[[84]](#c0079n00391)​[[85]](#c0079n00392) while other research suggests that rosiglitazone confers a protective effect from ischemic events.​[[86]](#c0079n00357) Studies of pioglitazone have more consistently lacked any signal of increased risk of ischemic events.​[[86]](#c0079n00357) To ensure that the risks and benefits of this medication have been clearly communicated, Health Canada requires that physicians counsel patients and obtain their written consent for all new and renewed rosiglitazone prescriptions. The FDA has removed its prescribing restrictions for rosiglitazone-containing products after a re-evaluation of the RECORD trial did not show an increased risk of MI.​[[87]](#c0079n00619)

### Insulin Regimens for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Due to the progressive nature of T2DM, noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents may lose their effectiveness over time. Insulin remains an important option for patients because of its powerful effects on lowering HbA1c and lack of a dose ceiling. Insulin does not alter CV risk.​[[47]](#c0079n00290) Although it is appropriate to consider insulin initiation at any point in the management of T2DM, it is commonly reserved for the following situations:

- Maximum tolerated dose of noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, yet HbA1c still not at target.
- End-organ damage (e.g., kidney failure), making use of some antihyperglycemics inappropriate.
- At initial diagnosis when there is evidence of metabolic decompensation and/or severe hyperglycemia.
- In pregnancy and in patients planning to become pregnant.

The use of insulin is often delayed for multiple reasons, one of which is the perceived complexity of self-injections. Also, insulin is associated with weight gain and carries a higher risk of hypoglycemia than other agents used to treat T2DM. Self-monitoring of glucose levels is critical to its safe and effective use. Many patients with T2DM require high doses of insulin (≥1 unit/kg) to overcome their significant insulin resistance, which in turn increases the risk for adverse effects. There are several commonly used insulin regimens (see [Table 4](#table-1184424341-E11ADE2C)):

- Insulin is generally initiated with antihyperglycemic therapy as a basal insulin only. This basal insulin may be initiated at a dose of 0.1–0.2 units/kg of LAIA or NPH insulin​[[47]](#c0079n00290)​[[88]](#c0079n00464) or, alternatively, an empiric dose of 5–10 units may be chosen. Subsequently, the dose is adjusted to achieve a fasting glucose <7 mmol/L. Some clinicians will choose to adjust insulin by 2 units every 3 days, whereas others may choose to increase basal insulin by 1 unit every night until the fasting blood glucose (FBG) target is achieved. Other antihyperglycemic agents may need to be reduced or eliminated once glycemic control is achieved; metformin is often continued because it has been proven to lower insulin requirements, ameliorate weight gain and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.​[[89]](#c0079n00465)

  If glycemic targets are not being met with basal insulin in combination with a daytime antihyperglycemic regimen, an intensified regimen can be initiated. Because of the adverse effects of insulin and the advent of GLP1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, it is recommended to utilize these agents prior to moving to a basal-bolus regimen in T2DM patients.​[[42]](#ShahBRBajajHSButaliaSEtAl.Pharmacol-95320303) These agents typically cause weight loss with a low risk of hypoglycemia, which can offset the adverse effects of insulin. There are currently 2 insulin/GLP1RA combination products available: lixisenatide/insulin glargine and liraglutide/insulin degludec.
- If a basal-bolus insulin regimen is necessary, insulin secretagogues and thiazolidinediones should be discontinued. Bolus insulin should be initiated with 1 injection/meal at a time and gradually increased to all 3 meals of the day, if necessary.
- If glycemic values are extremely high upon initial presentation, then a basal-bolus insulin regimen may be started immediately. To initiate insulin, start with 40% of the total daily dose (0.5 units/kg total insulin units divided over the 24-h day) administered as a basal insulin (NPH or LAIA) and 20% of the daily dose administered before meals 3 times daily (regular or RAIA). The dose is then adjusted to achieve glycemic targets. It is possible that once glycemia is under control, patients can be transitioned to an antihyperglycemic regimen that does not include insulin.
- Some T2DM patients who require insulin may need a simplified regimen. Insulin may be administered in twice-daily injections of a premixed insulin with two-thirds of the daily dose (0.5 units/kg) administered in the morning before breakfast and the remaining one-third of the daily dose administered before the evening meal (usually 30/70 [30% regular, 70% basal mix] in the morning and evening). These regimens provide convenience at the expense of flexibility and the ability to correct for abnormal results. However, this approach is a reasonable alternative for patients with diabetes who have little variation in exercise or food intake from day to day, require assistance for insulin injections, or do not have the cognitive ability or visual acuity to adjust insulin doses. In order to achieve glycemic targets with this regimen, both the dose and type of mixture may need to be modified.

### Targets for Control

The 2018 Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines emphasize that glycemic targets should be individualized based on patient-specific factors (see [Table 5](#c0079n00019)). The target of HbA1c ≤7% for most patients with T1DM and T2DM is based on strong evidence supporting the relationship between tight glucose control and a reduction in microvascular and neuropathic complications.​[[90]](#c0079n00595) In contrast, it remains unclear if macrovascular (ischemic) events are influenced by tight glucose control.​[[92]](#c0079n00467)​[[93]](#c0079n00468)​[[94]](#c0079n00469) A more aggressive HbA1c of ≤6.5% may be targeted in patients with T2DM if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risk of hypoglycemia. Conversely, a higher HbA1c of up to 8.5% may be more appropriate if the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the benefits of tight control, e.g., in frail older patients, those with limited life expectancy or patients with a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia.​[[90]](#c0079n00595)

Time-in-range (TIR) is increasingly being used as a tool to help assess overall glycemia as more and more people use CGM. With 24-hour glucose measurements available, CGMs have the ability to determine the percentage of time that a person spends within their desired glucose range. For reference, a 70% TIR equates to about an HbA1c level of 7%, with each 10% TIR change equating to about a 0.5% change in HbA1c. Combined with an ambulatory glucose profile that is produced with CGM, people living with diabetes have more information at their disposal to try to determine when and why their glucose levels may not be at their desired targets.​[[11]](#c0079n00291)

**Table 5:** Recommended Targets for Blood Glucose Control​[[a]](#afn51021)​[[23]](#c0079n00460)[[90]](#c0079n00595)[[91]](#PanagiotopoulosCHadjiyannakisSHende-B9EF7C52)

| Diabetes Type | HbA1c(%) | FPG/Preprandial Glucose(mmol/L) | 2-hPPG(mmol/L) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T2 | ≤6.5​ [b] | 4–7 4–5.5 if goal HbA 1c not reached | 5–10 5–8 if goal HbA 1c not reached |
| T1, T2 | ≤7 |
| T1, T2 | 7.1–8.5​ [c] |

[a] Glycemic targets should be selected to balance risks and benefits for an individual patient.

[b] Consider HbA1c ≤6.5% in some T2DM patients to reduce risk of nephropathy and retinopathy.

[c] HbA1c 7.1–8% may be considered for functionally dependent patients. Consider HbA1c 7.1–8.5% where there is a history of recurrent, severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, or in frail older patients with or without dementia.

*Vascular protection* is a critical component of the management strategy for patients with diabetes. It is important to target all associated risk factors in addition to achieving glycemic control.​[[95]](#c0079n00315) It has been shown that a coordinated, multifactorial intervention involving behaviour modification and pharmacologic therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body weight, microalbuminuria and platelet activation can significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes.​[[96]](#c0079n00321) See Diabetes Mellitus - Chronic Complications for further discussion of managing CV risk.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Carbohydrate intolerance during pregnancy can occur in patients with diabetes prior to pregnancy and in those who develop diabetes during pregnancy.

### Diabetes and Pregnancy

Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus can occur in patients of childbearing age, while *gestational diabetes mellitus* (GDM) is a condition that develops during pregnancy, primarily due to insulin resistance that results from the high levels of gestational hormones.​[[97]](#c0079n00394) Regardless of the specific diagnosis type, diabetes in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of negative outcomes in both the pregnant patient and the fetus/infant.​[[98]](#c0079n00050) Pre-existing diabetes (type 1 or 2) increases the risk of miscarriage, perinatal mortality, fetal macrosomia and congenital malformations, the latter being due to hyperglycemia in the first weeks of gestation.​[[99]](#c0079n00049) Similarly, GDM increases the risk of fetal hyperinsulinemia, heavier birth weight, cesarean deliveries and neonatal hypoglycemia.​[[97]](#c0079n00394) Children born to patients with diabetes and those with a history of GDM also appear to have an increased risk of developing diabetes in the future.​[[100]](#c0079n00472)

When diabetes is pre-existing, prepregnancy counselling is essential, and good glucose control should be achieved even before conception (see [Prepregnancy Planning](#Pre-pregnancyPlanning)).​[[97]](#c0079n00394) Although the benefits of treating patients with pre-existing diabetes have been clearly demonstrated,​[[97]](#c0079n00394) the benefits of treating GDM are less clear.​[[101]](#c0079n00473)​[[102]](#c0079n00474) Diabetes treatments confer a risk of hypoglycemia and some may exhibit teratogenic effects; thus, careful monitoring and therapeutic selection is required. Fortunately, hypoglycemia may not pose substantial risks to the developing fetus,​[[99]](#c0079n00049) but instances of diabetic ketoacidosis are very dangerous and can occur in cases such as unrecognized failure of an insulin pump.

### Prepregnancy Planning

Counsel patients of childbearing age with type 1 and type 2 diabetes about the need to plan and prepare for any pregnancy in order to minimize the risks to the fetus and to themselves. In the months preceding conception, patients should undertake the following risk-reduction activities:​[[97]](#c0079n00394)

- Begin folic acid supplementation (1 mg daily) at least 3 months prior to conception and continue until at least 12 weeks’ gestation.
- Undergo an eye exam because pregnancy can accelerate retinopathy resulting from poor glycemic control. A baseline exam should occur prior to conception, during the first trimester of pregnancy and at 1 year postpartum.​[[103]](#ChewEYMillsJLMetzgerBEEtAl.Metaboli-9B85CD22)​[[104]](#RasmussenKLLaugesenCSRingholmLEtAl.-997A36C4)
- Aim to achieve an HbA1c level of ≤7% (≤6.5% if safely achievable).
- Consider switching to a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.​[[105]](#MurphyHRRaymanGLewisKEtAl.Effective-997AA215)​[[106]](#MurphyHRRaymanGDuffieldKEtAl.Change-997AE044)
- Continue insulin, metformin or glyburide if already taking; switch to an insulin regimen if taking other antihyperglycemic agents including SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP1RAs.
- Undergo screening for cardiovascular disease (or risk factors) and CKD. Clinicians should be especially vigilant about CKD and hypertension prior to and throughout pregnancy, given the risk of an additive effect with pregnancy.
- Discontinue any teratogenic medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or statins. The fast-acting insulin analogues lispro and aspart are safe in pregnancy and may provide a decreased risk of hypoglycemia compared with regular insulin.​[[107]](#c0079n00601)​[[108]](#c0079n00602)​[[109]](#c0079n00603) The long-acting insulins NPH insulin, insulin degludec 100 units/mL, insulin detemir and insulin glargine 100 units/mL are safe to use in pregnancy.​[[110]](#c0079n00604)​[[111]](#c0079n00605)​[[112]](#MathiesenERAlibegovicACCorcoyREtAl.-89C92CD2)

### Management during Pregnancy

All pregnant patients should be screened for GDM; see [Figure 3](#c0079n00007) for the approach preferred by Diabetes Canada. Referral to a specialized clinic for the management of diabetes in pregnancy, if available, is recommended. Initiate nonpharmacologic therapy (strict diet and exercise) in patients who are newly diagnosed with GDM.​[[97]](#c0079n00394) Continue nonpharmacologic therapy and start multiple daily injections of RAIA or regular insulin if fasting and postprandial targets have not been met within 2 weeks of adjusting these lifestyle measures.​[[113]](#c0079n00606)​[[114]](#c0079n00607) The LAIAs glargine (100 units/mL) and detemir have demonstrated safety with similar maternal and fetal outcomes compared to NPH insulin.​[[97]](#c0079n00394) In patients with GDM who cannot take insulin, it may be reasonable to consider glyburide or metformin, recognizing that use of either agent is off-label.​[[102]](#c0079n00474)​[[115]](#c0079n00475) In a study designed to look at the impact of metformin use in pregnant patients with pre-existing T2DM who already use insulin, patients had better glycemic control, less weight gain, fewer C-sections and smaller babies with metformin added.​[[116]](#FeigDSDonovanLEZinmanBEtAl.Metformi-9B869145) There were, however, more “small for gestational age” babies. Future follow-up of this cohort will be needed to determine the long-term outcomes.

In patients with diabetes who become pregnant, strict glycemic control is recommended, along with frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Both pre- and postprandial testing is suggested in order to facilitate the achievement of both targets outlined in [Table 6](#c0079n00481). Consider the use of an insulin pump or CGM to improve glycemic control in those with T1DM. Aim to achieve an HbA1c level during pregnancy of ≤6.5% (≤6.1% if safely achievable). In addition, ketone testing (urine or blood) may be considered to ensure that the diet is adequate to prevent starvation ketosis. To reduce the risk of preeclampsia, patients with pre-existing diabetes should start **ASA** 81 mg daily at 12–16 weeks’ gestation and continue to delivery.

### Diabetes and Breastfeeding

Patients with diabetes are encouraged to breastfeed to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.​[[97]](#c0079n00394) Although insulin is transferred into breast milk, it poses little risk to the infant because the hormone is degraded in the GI tract before reaching the systemic circulation.​[[115]](#c0079n00475) As a result, breastfeeding patients receiving insulin do not need to alter their regimen unless it is in response to their personal glycemic levels. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is extremely important after delivery because insulin requirements may change quickly and the increased caloric output during breastfeeding theoretically puts the patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### Management during Breastfeeding

After delivery, glycemic monitoring should be performed frequently for the first 24 hours to assess for changes in blood glucose levels. In many cases of GDM, hyperglycemia will resolve completely during this time and antihyperglycemic medications may be discontinued altogether. In addition, all postpartum patients with GDM should have their glycemic status assessed by their primary care provider sometime in the months following delivery. All patients diagnosed with GDM should have a 75 g OGTT between 6 weeks and 6 months following delivery to detect persistent hyperglycemia.

In patients who require ongoing antihyperglycemic medication, insulin remains the first choice for reasons previously noted. However, both glyburide and metformin have also been used in breastfeeding patients with T2DM. Limited data suggest glyburide does not pass into breast milk, and metformin appears to have little penetration.​[[115]](#c0079n00475) Although these agents can be considered for use in breastfeeding patients, long-term studies have not been done to rule out any unanticipated adverse effects.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Assess all patients every 3–6 months. Study their home monitoring records (if available) and note the occurrence, frequency and trends of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia should be addressed before hyperglycemia to ensure patient safety in the short term.
- Review home blood glucose records, looking for predictable glucose trends that can be improved upon. Whether glucose readings are printed out, tabulated in a logbook or in the glucometer memory, they must be brought to follow-up appointments, reviewed and discussed.
- Inadequate control of diabetes is frequently related to poor adherence to diet and/or medications. Chronic infections can also negatively impact glucose control.
- The use of snacks may be important in some patients who use insulin and experience glycemic variability between meals; this could consist of a small amount of carbohydrate and protein. Not everyone will require a snack between meals.
- Monitor blood sugar, BP, serum lipids and body weight, and for the presence of complications. Foot examination is an integral part of such monitoring (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0079n00021)).
- Encourage all patients at risk of hypoglycemia to wear a MedicAlert ID bracelet or the equivalent.

### The Prevention and Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

### Risk Factors and Strategies

The prevalence of T2DM has been rising for decades and in 2024 there were 3.8 million Canadians living with diabetes.​[[117]](#c0079n00476) As a result, many studies have focused on preventative strategies aimed at individuals who exhibit risk factors for the development of this disease. Although family history, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and poor diet are risk factors for T2DM, individuals with slightly elevated blood glucose levels are likely at the greatest short-term risk of reaching the diagnostic threshold. Individuals who exhibit elevated blood glucose concentrations (yet below the threshold for diabetes) are often labelled as *prediabetic* and can be described as having *impaired fasting glucose* (FPG 6.1–6.9 mmol/L), *impaired glucose tolerance* (plasma glucose of 7.8–11 mmol/L 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose load) or both. Generally, individuals exhibiting slight elevations in blood glucose concentrations have been insulin-resistant for years, but glucose levels were likely maintained by increased insulin secretion. Frequently, insulin resistance is accompanied by other metabolic disruptions that are probably linked by 1 or more common biologic pathways. Clustering of metabolic risk factors such as central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and glucose abnormalities is termed *metabolic syndrome*. It confers a significant short-term risk of overt diabetes and a long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.​[[118]](#c0079n00477)

Several large studies have examined nonpharmacologic (diet, exercise, weight loss) and pharmacologic strategies aimed at preventing the onset of T2DM in high-risk individuals, including those with prediabetes.

The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS)​[[119]](#c0079n00051) and the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)​[[120]](#c0079n00052) showed that *calorie restriction* along with a supervised *exercise program* of moderate intensity (about 150 min/wk) significantly reduced the relative risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 58% at 4 years. In the DPS, diabetes was diagnosed in 11% of those randomized to lifestyle intervention versus 23% in the control group. In the DPP study, diabetes developed in 4.8%, 7.8% and 11% of those randomized to lifestyle intervention, metformin and placebo respectively. The weight loss associated with lifestyle interventions was about 5–6% of initial body weight in these studies. The benefits of the lifestyle changes persisted long after these trials were completed.​[[121]](#c0079n00349)​[[122]](#c0079n00053) These findings prove the success of lifestyle interventions and the significance for all people at high-risk of developing diabetes.

Other studies have evaluated the impact of pharmacologic interventions on the incidence of T2DM. It has been shown that metformin,​[[120]](#c0079n00052)​[[122]](#c0079n00053) acarbose,​[[123]](#c0079n00350) **TZDs**,​[[124]](#c0079n00338)​[[125]](#c0079n00079)​[[126]](#c0079n00336)​[[127]](#c0079n00520) orlistat,​[[128]](#c0079n00478) liraglutide​[[129]](#Pi-SunyerXAstrupAFujiokaKEtAl.ARand-4A68B503) and tirzepatide​[[130]](#JastreboffAMLeRouxCWStefanskiAEtAl.-89D4D929) can also reduce the incidence of T2DM in at-risk patients.

Significant and maintained weight loss, whether through bariatric surgery or restrictive calorie diets, is able to improve blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. In some people, glucose levels return to normal (HbA1c<6.0% without any antihyperglycemic medications for at least 3 months) or to prediabetic levels (HbA1c 6.0–6.4% without therapy for 6 months). Diabetes Canada guidelines note that the ability to sustain a weight loss of >15 kg provides the greatest chance of maintaining normal glucose levels without medications.​[[131]](#LeanMELeslieWSBarnesACEtAl.PrimaryC-B7D52C93)

Multiple classes of medications used in diabetes management have proven health advantages beyond glucose control, and it may not be beneficial to discontinue those that prevent adverse outcomes due to underlying cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Each individual considering trying to achieve remission from diabetes should be carefully considered for appropriate medication adjustments with this in mind. The greatest benefit may be in removing the need for insulin/insulin-secretagogues as they promote weight gain while continuing those medications with proven reductions in MACE, HF or renal risks.

Information to date suggests that individuals with the highest chance for successful remission are those who do not require insulin, whose blood glucose levels are not that elevated, who are motivated to lose weight in the instance of obesity and who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for less than 6 years.​[[131]](#LeanMELeslieWSBarnesACEtAl.PrimaryC-B7D52C93) Although there is still much to be learned, it is clear that weight loss can reduce the burden of medical needs and costs in some individuals and lead to remission of diabetes in others.

There are currently no measures to prevent T1DM in clinical use in Canada, although research continues to occur in this area.​[[132]](#QuattrinTMastrandreaLDWalkerLSK.Typ-5A7775FC)

### Diabetic Ketoacidosis

### Assessment and Management

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially fatal complication of severe insulin deficiency seen in T1DM that presents as metabolic decompensation of varying severity. It is characterized by variable hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acidosis, depressed levels of consciousness, and detectable ketones in the urine or blood.​[[133]](#c0079n00480) Upon presentation, patients are depleted in sodium, potassium, chloride and water. Despite body-wide potassium depletion, serum potassium is frequently elevated at the time of presentation due to lack of insulin and an inability of potassium to efficiently enter cells. Prerenal failure, or anuria, may be present secondary to severe dehydration. Hyperglycemia, as well as high triglycerides and free fatty acids, may result in pseudohyponatremia, or falsely low sodium measurements.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is found most often in T1DM and may be seen at first presentation in newly diagnosed patients or when patients are nonadherent to insulin therapy. It is also often associated with the onset of a severe or stressful illness (e.g., severe infection), surgery, trauma, MI or the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM who were previously stable. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis are generally hospitalized. A detailed treatment algorithm is published in the 2018 Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines and is available online​[[133]](#c0079n00480) [(https://guidelines.diabetes.ca)](http://guidelines.diabetes.ca/cpg/chapter15) and outlined in [Table 7](#table-1202331-E11BE382).

**Table 7:** Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis​[[133]](#c0079n00480)

| Fluids: Patients are always significantly volume depleted. Give IV NS 500 mL for 4 h, then 250 mL for 4 h (faster if in shock), then individualize. Good urinary output is reassuring that volume is being replaced. |
| Potassium: Potassium chloride is the preparation of choice. Do not give unless urine is being produced; may need to wait for IV fluids to improve volume status. If serum K​ + is <3.3 mmol/L, add K​ + 40 mmol/L of fluid; if 3.3–5.5 mmol/L, add K​ + 20 mmol/L; if >5.5 mmol/L, do not add K​ + , but monitor hourly. Rehydration and insulin will drive K​ + levels down. |
| Insulin: Do not give insulin if K​ + is <3.3 mmol/L, as insulin will drive K​ + into cells and drop levels further. Once K​ + >3.3 mmol/L, insulin can be infused at 0.1 units/kg/h using a second IV line. One protocol is as follows: mix 25 units R insulin in 250 mL NS and adjust rate to drop glucose to <14 mmol/L. Continue IV insulin until the anion gap resolves and patient is eating without nausea. Never stop or hold insulin in DKA. Rather, if the glucose drops below 14 mmol/L, continue the insulin infusion but also switch the saline IV to D5½NS and adjust the IV rate to maintain glucose between 12 and 14 mmol/L. When anion gap closed and patient is eating, overlap IV insulin with SC insulin by 2 h before stopping IV. DKA can rapidly reoccur if waiting for SC insulin to peak. |
| Bicarbonate: Not first-line therapy; infrequently used. Consider giving 1 ampoule (50 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate in 200 mL D5W over 1 h if acidosis is severe and ICU is being considered (e.g., pH <7, lowered LOC). |
| Laboratory tests: Latest recommendations include bedside testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone that is not detected with standard ketone testing.​ [134] ​ [135] Initial CBC, glucose, electrolytes, urea, creatinine and ABG. Request blood or urine cultures to look for infection as indicated. Radiology looking for infection/trigger as indicated. Repeat electrolyte and glucose hourly; ABG only if severe acidosis persists. Capillary glucose (with bedside glucometer) hourly for trends, but requires repeated blood draws for confirmation. |
| Supportive care: Keep the patient warm and rested. Insert an NG tube if vomiting and a urinary catheter if anuric (urinary retention may be significant). |
| Pitfalls: • Children with DKA are at higher risk of cerebral edema due to treatment of DKA with associated sodium, pH and glucose shifts. It is essential that a specialized team and monitored setting be used in pediatric cases. A diagnosis of DKA does not initially require detection of ketones. Routine detection of ketones may require both urine and blood testing over time. • For urinary ketones, Ketostix strips detect acetoacetate but not hydroxybutyrate; beware of false negatives. Acetone smell may be absent, undetected or unrecognized by some. Where available, use rapid serum beta-hydroxybutyrate testing. • Temperature may be low initially—absence of fever does not rule out infection. • Leukocytosis is usually present and does not necessarily mean infection. • Low serum sodium may be due to pseudohyponatremia from high glucose or TG. • High serum potassium is caused by acidosis and may be seen in spite of severe total body potassium depletion. • Dehydration may mask a respiratory infection; reassess after rehydration and stabilization. • Severe abdominal pain or signs of an acute abdomen need to be reassessed after stabilization—they often disappear. • A premature switch to SC insulin and/or discharge results in high recurrence and readmission rates. |

### Algorithms

![](images/diabetesmellitus_scrdiadiamel.gif)

[a] If both FPG and HbA1c are available but discordant, use the test that appears farthest to the right side of the algorithm.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd450568e3180) Consider 75 g OGTT if ≥1 risk factors.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd450568e3183) Consider 75 g OGTT.

[[d]](#fnsrc_figfndd450568e3186) Prediabetes = IFG or HbA1c 6–6.4%.

[[e]](#fnsrc_figfned450568e3192) In the presence of symptoms of hyperglycemia, a single test result in the diabetes range is sufficient to make the diagnosis of diabetes. In the absence of symptoms of hyperglycemia, if a single laboratory test result is in the diabetes range, a repeat confirmatory laboratory test (FPG, HbA1c, 2hPG in a 75 g OGTT) must be done on another day. It is preferable that the same test be repeated (in a timely fashion) for confirmation, but a random PG in the diabetes range in an asymptomatic individual should be confirmed with an alternative test. If results of 2 different tests are available and both are above the diagnostic cut points, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.
