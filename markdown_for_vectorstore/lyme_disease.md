### Introduction

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in North America and Europe; it is endemic in many areas of Canada​[[1]](#lymeCanada) and the United States​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C) and is reported in Europe and Asia.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C) In North America, cases are transmitted by the *Ixodes scapularis* or *Ixodes pacificus*, whereas in Europe, the responsible tick is *Ixodes ricinus*. The bacteria that causes the infection is Borrelia, a gram-negative microaerophilic mobile spirochete. Infections in North America are caused by B. burgdorferi whereas those in Europe are most often caused by B. afzelii and B. garinii.​[[3]](#OgdenNHKoffiJKPelcatYEtAl.Environme-6B20BCE1)​[[4]](#ParolaPRaoultD.TicksAndTickborneBac-6B20B91A)​[[5]](#euroTICKS) In 2009, this zoonosis became a notifiable disease in Canada; the number of reported cases increased substantially. From 2009 through 2021, the total reported Lyme disease cases increased from 144 to 3147.​[[1]](#lymeCanada) This likely is an underestimation of cases, given that many cases are not reported. Surveillance data from the Public Health Agency of Canada have confirmed the spreading of blacklegged ticks in Canada (see [Figure 1](#PHACLymeRates)).​[[3]](#OgdenNHKoffiJKPelcatYEtAl.Environme-6B20BCE1)​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC)

Wooded areas, those with tall brush or grass, or spots under leaves are the natural environments where most ticks are found because these are areas with the highest density of animals such as birds and small mammals, e.g., mice, chipmunks. A detailed review of pertinent ecology and life cycle has been published.​[[7]](#tickEcol) As these animal pass by, the immature and larval ticks attach to and subsequently feed on them. Adult ticks feed on white-tailed deer, which are also in rural or suburban areas.​[[4]](#ParolaPRaoultD.TicksAndTickborneBac-6B20B91A)​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355) Ticks will feed only once during each of their 3 life cycles (larva, nymph and adult) and can acquire B. burgdorferi by feeding on infected animals.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355) Ticks can be on vegetation and attach to a new host to feed. Once on the host (e.g., mouse, deer, human), they move until they encounter some resistance; in humans, if they are on skin, they may move until they encounter an elastic, a skin fold or even a hairline. At that point, they will stop and feed, injecting blood that is infected with the spirochete. Human transmission is more likely during the nymphal stage, as nymphs are abundant and extremely small (0.15 cm, or pinhead size) and therefore less likely to be detected.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)

The spirochete resides in the midgut of the tick where it undergoes replication; as the tick becomes engorged during a feeding, the spirochete will migrate into the tick’s salivary glands.​[[7]](#tickEcol)​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020) Upon the start of feeding, this process takes between 36 and 72 hours, which explains why the risk of human transmission parallels the duration of tick attachment. Compared to shorter periods of attachment, there is a 20-fold increase in transmissibility when the attachment period reaches 72 hours.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) At the site of entry into the skin, the B. burgdorferi pathogen replicates, causing the initial immune host response and resulting in a local skin manifestation. Over the subsequent days to months, hematogenous spread to various target organs may happen in the absence of treatment at the earlier stage.

The incidence of Lyme disease is highest among children 5–14 years of age with a second peak in adults 55–79 years of age;​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[11]](#OnyettH.LymeDiseaseInCanadaFocusOnC-6B20B668)​[[12]](#MurisonK-F0488332) theorized to be due to increased outdoor exposure for play and recreational pursuits. Transmission peaks during the spring and summer months when outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, hunting or working in wooded areas are more common. Since infected ticks may also be in gardens or near residential areas, absence of a specific exposure to a wooded area does not rule out potential exposure.​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC)​[[13]](#BrattonRLWhitesideJWHovanMJEtAl.Dia-6B20ABD6)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevention of tick exposure
- Postexposure prophylaxis in selected cases
- Appropriate recognition and treatment of early localized and disseminated stages in order to prevent the occurrence of late manifestations (e.g., Lyme arthritis and late neuroborreliosis)

### Investigations

### Clinical Presentation

The diagnosis of Lyme disease rests on the clinical evaluation.​[[14]](#SanchezJL-845D63CE) An awareness of the epidemiology of Lyme disease in geographic areas is also critical when evaluating potential cases.

The diagnostic criteria does not include a witnessed tick bite, given that 30–50% of patients are unaware of having been bitten.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355)​[[13]](#BrattonRLWhitesideJWHovanMJEtAl.Dia-6B20ABD6) There are 3 recognized stages of illness, defined by their specific manifestations and their onset in regards to the initial infection; however, there may be waxing and waning of symptoms within each stage and overlap between stages. The major manifestations are local skin lesions (erythema migrans) at the site of a tick bite as well as disseminated disease presenting with multiple skin lesions, neurological symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormalities and arthritis:

1. **Erythema migrans:** The most common manifestation is the localized erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion (seen in up to 80% of cases) that manifests on average 7–10 days following the tick bite, although 3–32 days has been reported.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC) It typically begins as a macule or papule at the site of the tick bite then subsequently enlarges to reach a threshold diameter of at least 5 cm. It can occur anywhere on the body, but typical sites include the groin, axilla, waist, back, legs and the head/neck area in children.​[[13]](#BrattonRLWhitesideJWHovanMJEtAl.Dia-6B20ABD6)​[[14]](#SanchezJL-845D63CE) In children, half of tick bites are sustained on the head or neck, which explains why they may go unnoticed.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) At least two-thirds of solitary EM lesions are initially erythematous plaques, with or without an enhanced central erythema, but many possible variations have been described including a “bull’s eye” appearance, blistering or necrotic areas, and blue or purple hues. Lesions may also be asymmetrical with 1 part more prominent than the other(s).​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC)​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) Photographs of EM can be found in [Table 1](#EMImages) and on the [Public Health Agency of Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/health-professionals-lyme-disease.html#a2.en.html). A review article by [Hofmann et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28943834/) provides more information regarding cutaneous manifestations.​[[15]](#Hofmann2017)

   Differential diagnoses of EM include other common skin conditions but can be differentiated from EM with the following characteristics:

   - Cellulitis: lesions are tender to the touch, poorly delineated, warm and exhibit localized swelling (edema). In EM, lesions are non-tender to the touch, have well-defined margins and may be pruritic or have a stinging sensation
   - Nummular eczema: skin thickened, lesions smaller and less erythematous than EM
   - Tinea corporis: raised margins and scale on the edges
   - Insect bite: raised papule with or without a central punctum and smaller than EM; these are often pruritic in the early stages
   - Hypersensitivity to tick bite: does not expand as EM does, and presents at the time of a tick bite (or very soon after); often pruritic​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)

   Without treatment, the EM lesion may last 3–4 weeks. Early localized disease can by accompanied by flulike symptoms in 57% of cases.​[[16]](#Johnson-F04BF8D1)

2. **Early disseminated Lyme disease:** In cases of untreated localized Lyme disease, hematogenous dissemination of the spirochete can occur weeks to months following initial infection and result in end-organ involvement. The most common manifestations involve the dermatologic, cardiac, nervous and ophthalmologic systems. Most cases of early disseminated Lyme disease are associated with nonspecific manifestations such as fatigue, general weakness, arthralgias and/or myalgias. Fever is much more common in the disseminated stage than in the localized stage. Common manifestations of the disseminated phase include:

   - Skin:

     - Multiple EM lesions (in 20% of cases) that are typically smaller than localized EM; these may fade and reappear at different sites
     - Other dermatological manifestations, such as lymphocytomas (more common in children) or vaginal ulcers, may also be present
   - Neurological (acute neuroborreliosis in 12.5% of patients):​[[17]](#Halperin2018)​[[18]](#lymeChildren)

     - Aseptic meningitis:

       - Symptoms typically last for >7 days before the patient presents to medical attention. Papilledema is rare in adults, but well described in children. The course of Lyme meningitis is typically more indolent than in viral meningitis; the predominant features include history of headache lasting several days, and neck pain or listlessness without frank meningismus. Cranial neuropathy and EM are often present on evaluation and are more common in children compared to adults. Of note, young children may present with nonspecific symptoms, such as anorexia, mood changes and fatigue​[[19]](#BruinsmaRA-B8C57AE4)
       - Clinicians should be aware of the risk of increased intracranial pressure and papilledema associated with Lyme meningitis in children; the pathogenesis is poorly understood but might involve the deposition of immune complexes in the arachnoid villi.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) Symptoms may include headaches that are more severe in the morning, after prolonged horizontal positioning, or exacerbated by coughing, Valsalva or bending over. Pulsatile tinnitus also suggests intracranial hypertension
       - Examination of the optic discs and monitoring of visual acuity is essential in any child presenting with early disseminated Lyme disease
     - Cranial neuropathy: facial nerve palsy is the most common neurological manifestation of Lyme disease and occurs in 80% of the cases of cranial nerve involvement.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355) Bilateral involvement may be seen in up to 22% of cases.​[[20]](#Crissinger) Although less common, any of the other cranial nerves can be involved (e.g., nerves to the extraocular muscles, the trigeminal and occasionally the acusticovestibular nerves)
     - Mononeuritis multiplex and meningoradiculitis (Bannwarth syndrome) are more common in adults compared to children
     - Myelitis
   - Cardiac (in 1–4% of patients), much rarer in children, usually within weeks to a few months after onset of infection:​[[21]](#ShenRV-B8C997F9)

     - Atrioventricular (AV) block:

       - Due to host inflammatory response directed at the spirochetes invading cardiac tissue​[[22]](#ForresterJDMeadP.Third-degreeHeartB-71659F75)
       - Can be asymptomatic or present as dizziness, syncope, dyspnea, conduction abnormalities or heart failure
       - Usually above the bundle of His, often involving AV node (first- to third-degree heart block); however, may occur at multiple levels.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020) Complete heart block is rare (<1%) and more commonly reported in young male patients.​[[22]](#ForresterJDMeadP.Third-degreeHeartB-71659F75) (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients*.)
     - Other EKG changes, e.g., T wave abnormalities, ST-segment changes, prolonged QTC interval
     - Myopericarditis
     - Cardiomyopathy (rare)
     - Patients presenting with carditis may also have concomitant EM, arthritis or meningoencephalitis
   - Ocular:

     - Conjunctivitis
     - Uveitis or panophthalmitis
     - Orbital myositis (rare)​[[23]](#lymeOrbitalMyositis)
3. **Late Lyme disease:** In the absence of appropriate therapy at earlier stages, late disease manifestations can occur, typically >3 months after the initial infection. The musculoskeletal or nervous system are more commonly involved. Since these are late manifestations, a high index of suspicion is required as well as a thorough clinical assessment to distinguish its presentation from other chronic inflammatory disorders of the musculoskeletal or nervous system; specific skin lesions are rarely seen. Manifestations of late Lyme disease include:

   - Musculoskeletal: asymmetric monoarthritis or, less commonly, oligoarthritis (seen in less than 10% of patients):​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[24]](#Arvikar-845DB156)

     - Pathophysiology and clinical course consistent with a reactive arthritis; typically affecting the knees (90% of cases) and/or other large joints as well as the temporomandibular joint​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)
     - Presentation is generally subacute (i.e., days); if presentation is acute, septic arthritis due to bacterial pathogens should be considered
     - Effusion often disproportionately predominates compared to pain; inflammation may persist for several weeks. Fever can be present but is usually low grade
     - Joint fluid may be positive for B. burgdorferi DNA prior to antibiotic therapy; however, the effusion can persist even after spirochete elimination. Synovial fluid microscopy shows a polymorphonuclear predominance. Synovial fluid WBC can exceed 50 000 cells/mm​2, especially in children
     - If untreated, may present with intermittent and relapsing episodes of joint inflammation and can involve other joints​[[18]](#lymeChildren)​[[24]](#Arvikar-845DB156)
   - Neurologic (in 3% of patients​[[17]](#Halperin2018)):

     - Encephalopathy: impairment of memory and concentration; CSF analysis often normal​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)
     - Chronic axonal polyneuropathy: distal paresthesias (stocking glove process), reduced vibratory sensation of distal lower extremities, radicular pain or ataxic gait​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)
   - Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (1% of patients, mostly older adults):​[[15]](#Hofmann2017)

     - Can present months to years after the initial infection and can be accompanied by peripheral neuropathy in 50% of patients
     - Focal areas of skin becomes edematous and erythematous, then violaceous and atrophic

### Prognosis of Treated Lyme Disease and Persistent Symptoms Post-Treatment

The majority of the manifestations of Lyme disease resolve over time with treatment.​[[25]](#FederHMJohnsonBConnellS2007) Recovery is typically complete, with the exceptions of nerve palsies and radiculopathy for which sequelae are possible. Lyme arthritis may take several months to resolve after effective therapy, with some cases requiring consultation with a rheumatologist. Atrioventricular block from Lyme carditis also resolves, with third-degree block resolving within 1 week of treatment initiation and lesser disturbances taking up to 6 weeks.​[[22]](#ForresterJDMeadP.Third-degreeHeartB-71659F75)

Despite effective therapy, some patients experience residual symptoms, such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, or difficulties with concentration and short-term memory.​[[25]](#FederHMJohnsonBConnellS2007) In 1 study, this occurred in 10.9% of adult patients.​[[26]](#Weitzner2015) These patients are classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms since these symptoms persisted for longer than 6 months. There is no definitive evidence that these nonspecific symptoms represent ongoing infection, and prospective trials have found the frequency of symptoms is similar to that of healthy adults.​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC) Additionally, prolonged antibiotic courses did not improve such symptoms.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[27]](#Berende-75686936) Currently, there is no rationale to support the decision of prolonging antimicrobial course in patients experiencing persistent nonspecific symptoms after the completion of appropriate therapy.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) Serious adverse effects resulting in harm were seen in trials with prolonged courses of antibiotics and may preclude diagnosis of other conditions. The Canadian Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (AMMI Canada) has produced a position statement on persistent symptoms post Lyme disease.​[[28]](#AMMIPositionStatement2019)

Patients should be aware that antibodies against B. burgdorferi expressed early are not protective, and reinfection has been documented.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355)​[[29]](#Nadelman-F05864BF)​[[30]](#Nadelman-F058858F)

### Laboratory Testing

For typical lesions, a clinical diagnosis is sufficient in the proper clinical context. If patients have atypical lesions, acute and convalescent testing can be performed before treatment with antibiotics. Given that false positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and even IgM immunoblot are well described in the presence of cross-reacting antibodies to other spirochetal diseases (e.g., syphilis, leptospirosis) and in viral infections (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19),​[[31]](#lymeDiag) clinical correlation should be used to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease.

The reliability of testing at some laboratories has not been validated and therefore testing should always be done at approved laboratories in Canada. Two-tiered serological testing in Canada (see [Figure 2](#SerologicalTestingAlgorithm-6B3E4FFB)) consists of:

1. A screening EIA
2. A confirmatory immunoblot (IB) if the EIA is equivocal or positive

Clinicians should specify the presumed exposure area on the test requisition as European Lyme disease, which is caused by a different Borrelia species (B. afzelii and B. garinii) and requires alternative serologic testing in order to be detected.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[32]](#Waddell2016)

A typical EM lesion in the appropriate epidemiologic context should always be considered a clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease regardless of serology because serological testing at this early stage has poor sensitivity (25–40%).​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[33]](#LohrBFingerleVNorrisDEEtAl.Laborato-8997B755)​[[34]](#senSerology) The sensitivity of the 2-tiered assay (see below) reaches 80–100% in patients with early disseminated, neurological or cardiac Lyme disease, and nearly 100% in late stages.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[32]](#Waddell2016) In cases of negative testing but a high degree of suspicion for early disseminated, neurological or cardiac disease, serology can be repeated in 2–4 weeks.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[33]](#LohrBFingerleVNorrisDEEtAl.Laborato-8997B755)​[[35]](#SanchezEVannierEWormserGPEtAl.Diagn-6B209D8F)

Treatment of typical Lyme disease affecting the cardiac or nervous system should precede obtaining results of serological testing results if clinically indicated. Antibodies may also persist for years, so a positive serological result cannot distinguish between active or past infection and therefore should not be used as a “test of cure” nor to monitor treatment response.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56)​[[33]](#LohrBFingerleVNorrisDEEtAl.Laborato-8997B755)

**Abbreviations**

IB
:   immunoblot

IgG
:   immunoglobulin G

IgM
:   immunoglobulin M

Other laboratory tests that may be considered:

- Lumbar puncture (LP): analysis of the CSF should be considered for patients with suspected meningitis or patients with unilateral facial nerve palsy with symptoms such as delirium, fever, or severe or prolonged headache.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)

  - Opening pressure measurement should be performed during lumbar puncture.​[[36]](#RogersJD-B8C8F205)
  - CSF cell count will typically show around 100 total nucleated cells with lymphocyte predominance (typically relative polymorphonuclear cell count is <10%). Protein and glucose concentrations are typically normal.​[[13]](#BrattonRLWhitesideJWHovanMJEtAl.Dia-6B20ABD6)​[[17]](#Halperin2018)
  - The sensitivity of the PCR on the CSF is very low and should not be ordered routinely.
- Synovial fluid analysis:

  - Usually done to rule out other causes of arthritides. However, in the proper setting with typical findings and positive serology, synovial fluid analysis may not be required to initiate therapy.
  - Cell counts (usually in the inflammatory range: ≥10 000 to 25 000 cells/mm​3) are not useful to discriminate Lyme arthritis from septic arthritis.
  - PCR detection of B. burgdorferi DNA can be performed (sensitivity of 75%) but should not be used as a stand-alone test. Additionally, PCR may remain positive after therapy and does not necessarily reflect active infection.​[[35]](#SanchezEVannierEWormserGPEtAl.Diagn-6B209D8F)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG); unless patients have symptoms of carditis (e.g., dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, chest pain), ECG should not be done routinely.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)
- Other routine laboratory tests are nonspecific; CBC is unlikely to be helpful and is typically normal.

### Co-infection

In cases of refractory Lyme disease within the proper epidemiologic context, co-infection with other *Ixodes scapularis*–borne pathogens should be suspected in patients who may have acquired the disease outside of Canada. These pathogens may include Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi, a novel *Ehrlichia muris*-like bacterium and Powassan virus.​[[3]](#OgdenNHKoffiJKPelcatYEtAl.Environme-6B20BCE1)

### Prevention

In the absence of licensed human vaccine, protection against tick bites is the mainstay of prevention of Lyme disease. The Public Health Agency of Canada proposes the following strategies to minimize tick exposure:​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC)

- Wear light coloured, long-sleeved shirts and pants to spot ticks more easily.
- Shower or bathe within 2 hours of being outdoors, with special attention to armpit, groin, back and scalp areas; this is likely to be effective in dislodging unattached ticks.
- Conduct a daily full-body check for ticks on yourself and on children, especially in the hairline, underarms, belly button and groin. If a tick is found, remove it as promptly as possible (see [Tick Removal](#TickRemovalLyme)).
- Use tick repellent

  - Diethyltoluamide (DEET)​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56)

    - Health Canada recommends:​[[37]](#HC_InsectRepellents)

      - children <6 months: DEET not recommended
      - children 6 months to 2 years of age: DEET 10% applied once a day (for less than 1 month)
      - children 2–12 years of age: DEET 10% applied up to 3 times per day (for less than 1 month)
      - children >12 years and adults: DEET 30% (maximum: 33%)
    - Only very small amounts are absorbed in the skin after topical application and the compound is rapidly eliminated
    - Average duration of protection is 5 hours
    - Side effects are rare but include headaches and ataxia
  - Icaridin (picaridin)

    - Health Canada recommends icaridin as the preferred insect repellent for children 6 months to 12 years of age. It should not be used in children <6 months of age​[[37]](#HC_InsectRepellents)
    - Average duration of protection is 8-10 hours with concentrations of 20%

  For more details on repellents, see Insect Bites and Stings in the *Compendium of Therapeutics for Minor Ailments*.

### Tick Removal

In case of tick attachment, the following steps are recommended during removal (see [Figure 3](#TickRemovalImage)):​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC)

- Use clean tweezers to grasp the head of the tick as close as possible to the skin.
- Pull perpendicularly to the skin surface in a consistent motion; avoid twisting or jerking, as this may cause the tick’s mouthparts to separate from its body and remain in the skin.
- Wash the bite area with soap and water or alcohol-based disinfectant.
- In cases where the mouthparts of the tick cannot be removed, they are usually eliminated uneventfully by the body.
- Try to save the tick in a sealed container and record the date.
- In order to support the surveillance of Lyme disease, the tick can be sent to a Public Health authority for identification and testing. This will not be used for diagnostic purposes, as diagnosis relies on clinical criteria; however, it will assist in passive surveillance efforts. For more information on how to submit ticks to individual provincial authorities for testing, visit [Health Canada’s website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/removing-submitting-ticks-testing.html#a4).

See [Infographic](#InfographicTickRemoval) for a patient handout on tick prevention and removal.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

Refer to [Table 3](#dt-lyme) for dosing recommendations in the treatment of Lyme disease.

In addition to the PHAC website,​[[6]](#GovernmentOfCanada.ForHealthProfess-6B20B4DC) provincial, territorial or regional public health websites may have Lyme disease information specific to their respective region.​[[38]](#ProvincialTerritorialResources)

### Postexposure Prophylaxis

In the event of a documented high-risk tick bite (see criteria below), follow the algorithm listed in [Figure 4](#PostExposureProphylaxisAlgorithm).

Current guidelines recommend postexposure prophylaxis only in patients meeting *all* of the following 3 criteria:​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)

1. The local rate of B. burgdorferi infection in ticks is more than 20%. An interactive risk map for Canada is available from the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/surveillance-lyme-disease.html); clinicians can also consult local public health for information on infected tick burden and Lyme disease incidence.
2. The tick is identified as a blacklegged tick (*Ixodes* species). Examples of sites to help identify ticks include [eTick](https://www.etick.ca) and the [Government of Quebec](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/en/detailed-description-ixodes-scapularis-or-black-legged-tick-or-deer-tick).
3. The time of attachment was at least 36 hours.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[39]](#mgmtPedLyme) Since timing is sometimes difficult to determine,  assessment of the degree of tick engorgement may be helpful. This is an important predictor of subsequent disease. Unfed nymph and adult female ticks are the size of a poppy seed and a sesame seed, respectively.​[[40]](#TopTenTickHidingSpots)

If the above 3 criteria are met and there are no contraindications to doxycycline, a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg (or 4 mg/kg for those weighing <45 kg) can be offered if therapy is started within 72 hours of tick removal. Placebo-controlled studies have confirmed that a single dose of doxycline is effective at preventing Lyme disease.​[[41]](#NaderlmanRBLugerSWGomezGEtAl.Prophy-6B209C15)

The risk of transmission from a recognized bite is only 2.5–4.6%, even in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020) The NNT to prevent 1 case of Lyme disease is 50, but would be reduced to 11 if chemoprophylaxis was restricted to individuals whose tick was visibly engorged.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[42]](#WarshafskySLeeDHFrancoisLKEtAl.Effi-6B209A39)

In children <8 years of age who are in a known endemic area and have had a high risk exposure (e.g., all 3 of the above postexposure prophylaxis criteria are met), the benefit of a single dose of doxycycline may outweigh the risk of potential side effects. Prophylactic amoxicillin for Lyme in this age group has not been studied and, due to its short half-life, is unlikely to be effective as a single dose; thus, it should not be used for this indication.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355)​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[11]](#OnyettH.LymeDiseaseInCanadaFocusOnC-6B20B668)​[[39]](#mgmtPedLyme)

In pregnant or breastfeeding patients, prophylaxis should be based on the risk of infection versus the risk of antibiotic treatment. This will require an informed discussion with individual patients.​[[43]](#SOGC2020) For more information, see [Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding](#PregnancyBFLyme).

Patient who receive postexposure prophylaxis should be counselled that prophylaxis may not prevent disease (especially if a longer time has passed since tick removal). These patients, and those who *do not* receive prophylaxis (children and adults), should monitor for signs and symptoms of Lyme disease for up to 1 month.

### Treatment of Lyme Disease

The choice of antibiotic agent, route of administration (i.e., IV/PO) and treatment duration for Lyme disease varies according to the clinical syndrome at presentation. Updated recommendations are available from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020) Of note, doxycycline is acceptable in children <8 years of age if duration is ≤ 21 days.​[[44]](#RedBookLymeDisease-8E3AD8DC)​[[45]](#Cross2016)

See [Table 2](#LymeTable) for a list of first- and second-line agents. Refer to [Table 3](#dt-lyme) for dosing recommendations.

If patients have meningitis or other cranial nerve involvement, empiric ceftriaxone is usually started upon admission to hospital. Once the diagnosis of Lyme disease is reasonably certain (typically lymphocytic pleocytosis) and other pathogens are ruled out, oral therapy with doxycycline can be given to complete a 14–day course. Alternatively, IV penicillin G can be used for a total of 14 days.

Patients with myocarditis, significant PR prolongation (PR >300 milliseconds), arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities should be admitted to hospital for monitoring and receive ceftriaxone initially, with transition to oral doxycycline once clinical improvement is documented. The total duration of therapy should be 14–21 days.

Patients with Lyme arthritis should initially receive a 28-day course of oral doxycycline. If Lyme arthritis fails to completely resolve or a relapse occurs, treatment with a 14- to 28–day course of IV ceftriaxone is recommended. Alternatively, if mild joint swelling is present, a second 28–day course of doxycycline is recommended.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[39]](#mgmtPedLyme)

Special notes:

- First-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin) are not effective for treatment of Lyme disease.
- About 15% of patients experience a reaction similar to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (fever, chills, rigors, sweating, myalgia, arthralgia) within 24 hours after treatment has begun; this occurs as a result of an increase in circulating toxins associated with lysis of spirochetes. The reaction is benign, lasts <48 hours and can be alleviated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)
- Synovitis persisting ≥2 months after a course of IV ceftriaxone (or after completion of 2 courses of oral antibiotics) is defined as “antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis.” Affected patients should be referred to a rheumatologist.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020) Excessive inflammation due to different strains of B. burgdorferi, immune dysregulation and infection-induced autoimmunity despite sterilization of synovial fluid are hypothesized to play a role in this condition.​[[46]](#SteereACArvikarSL.WhatConstitutesAp-6B209091)
- In randomized placebo-controlled trials, no evidence has supported the prolonged use of antimicrobial agents; the risks of prolonged treatment far outweigh the benefits.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)​[[17]](#Halperin2018)​[[47]](#HalperinJJShapiroEDLogigianEEtAl.Pr-6B2094F6) A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 280 patients failed to demonstrate any difference on the health-related quality of life among patients who received a 12-week course of doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following a standard treatment course for Lyme disease;​[[27]](#Berende-75686936) thus, only supportive care is recommended.​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355)

| Indication | First Line | Duration | Second Line | Duration | Clinical Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Erythema migrans (EM) |
| Single or multiple EM (without neurologic, cardiac or musculoskeletal manifestations) | Doxycycline PO | 10 days | Azithromycin PO​ [a] | 7 days (range: 5–10 days ) | Cure rate >90% for doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. However, azithromycin has lower efficacy (80%).​ [a] |
| Amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO (comparable efficacy)​ [48] | 14 days |  |  |
| Lyme neuroborreliosis (neurologic manifestations) |
| Facial nerve palsy | Doxycycline PO | 14–21 days ​ [44] | Amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 14– 21 days | Other than doxycycline, data to support the efficacy of oral agents is scarce. Antibiotic treatment does not affect the course of the facial palsy, but prevents late disease.​ [18] No benefit of adjunctive therapy with steroids has been reported.​ [49] If initial diagnosis is uncertain, steroids can be used along with an antibiotic until diagnosis of Lyme is confirmed, at which time discontinuation of steroids should be considered. |
| Meningitis, radiculoneuropathy or cranial neuropathy (including cranial nerve involvement other than 7​ th ) | Ceftriaxone IV or doxycycline PO​ [39] | 14 days (range: 10–21 days ) | Cefotaxime IV or penicillin G IV​ [b] | 14– 21 days | All of the listed antibiotics appear effective. The use of oral doxycycline for ≤21 days in children <8 y has been shown to be safe.​ [50] Intracranial hypertension may need to be managed with medications such as acetazolamide.​ [51] The use of peripherally inserted catheters for prolonged durations may increase the risk of adverse events. |
| Once other causes of meningitis have been excluded and if mildly ill or to complete initial IV therapy: doxycycline PO (200 mg once daily) | 14– 21 days |
| Lyme carditis |
| Carditis | Outpatients (mildly ill): doxycycline PO, amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 14– 21 days |  |  | Patients should be admitted to hospital if clinical symptoms of cardiac involvement or if PR interval is ≥300 milliseconds, as this is a risk factor for sudden death and may be an indication for a temporary pacemaker. |
| Hospitalized: ceftriaxone IV or cefotaxime IV, with step-down to doxycycline PO​ [b] | 14–21 days |
| Lyme arthritis |
| Arthritis | Amoxicillin PO, doxycycline PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 28 days | Penicillin G IV | 14– 28 days | There may be mild residual joint swelling after 1 course of antimicrobials, with complete resolution taking longer. Concomitant use of NSAID s may hasten recovery.​ [18] However, if there is minimal improvement with the 28-day course of oral doxycycline, a course of ceftriaxone for 14– 28 days can be considered, after discussing risk of potential side effects with the patient or caregiver. |
| Recurrent or refractory arthritis | Doxycycline | 28 days |  |  |
| Ceftriaxone IV or cefotaxime IV | 14 days (see Clinical Comments) |

[a] Macrolides should be used only if doxycycline is contraindicated and the patient has had a prior, documented serious reaction to amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil or doxycycline. If a macrolide is used, ensure adequate follow-up due to reduced efficacy.

[b] Once patients are clinically stable and are well enough to be treated as outpatients, step-down to PO therapy if clinically improving.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Lyme Disease during Pregnancy or Breastfeeding

To date, there is no documented case of maternal-to-fetal transmission of B. burgdorferi.​[[2]](#ShapiroED.LymeDisease.NEnglJMed2014-6B20B04C)​[[11]](#OnyettH.LymeDiseaseInCanadaFocusOnC-6B20B668) Detailed epidemiological investigations have failed to demonstrate an association between maternal infection during pregnancy and any adverse fetal outcomes (including prematurity or congenital malformation), whether maternal exposure occurs before conception or during pregnancy itself.​[[43]](#SOGC2020) There is also no evidence of transmission via breastfeeding.​[[10]](#SoodSK.LymeDiseaseInChildren.Infect-6B20AA56) Outcomes are as favourable for pregnant patients as for other patient populations.​[[9]](#IDSA_AAN_ACR_2020)

### Pharmacologic Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The treatment practices for Lyme disease in pregnant or breastfeeding patients follow the treatment recommendations for Lyme disease in adults in terms of duration and antimicrobial choice. The [Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32414479/) (SOGC) has published committee opinion on the management of tick bites and Lyme disease in pregnancy.​[[43]](#SOGC2020)

Doxycycline was previously contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding patients due to the theoretical risk of permanent tooth discoloration and possible effect on bone formation in the fetus;​[[8]](#HuLT.LymeDisease.AnnInternMed201616-6B20B355)​[[43]](#SOGC2020) however, to date, no such risk has been identified in pregnant​[[43]](#SOGC2020) or breastfeeding individuals.​[[52]](#Lactmed) The SOGC suggests that doxycycline may be considered for *postexposure prophylaxis* if the pregnant or breastfeeding individual meets the 3 criteria listed in [Postexposure Prophylaxis](#PostexposureProphylaxisLyme), after discussion of risks versus benefits with the individual.​[[43]](#SOGC2020) Conversely, the *treatment* of Lyme disease with doxycycline is not recommended in pregnant individuals due to the availability of other agents (e.g., amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil).​[[43]](#SOGC2020)

Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for severe disease (e.g., neurological involvement, advanced heart block) in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, while mild/localized disease should be treated with amoxicillin or cefuroxime **axetil**.

There is no evidence that the use of DEET or icaridin (picaridin) by pregnant or breastfeeding patients poses a health hazard to unborn babies or breastfed infants/children.​[[43]](#SOGC2020)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Prevention of tick bites is important (see [Infographic](#InfographicTickRemoval)).
- Treatment of Lyme disease is effective at all stages of the infection; therapeutic failures are very uncommon.
- Doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are equivalent choices for the treatment of early Lyme disease as well as carditis and arthritis due to Lyme disease. See [Table 2](#LymeTable).
- There is increasing evidence that oral doxycycline is effective for acute neuroborreliosis if the patient is stable.
