### Introduction

Intestinal gas represents a normal and common biological process in healthy adults. Excess gas in the digestive tract can be found in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. These gases are removed via flatulence or eructation (belching).​[[1]](#psc1034n1001)​[[2]](#psc1034n1002) Common symptoms reported in relation to gastrointestinal (GI) gas include abdominal discomfort, distention or pain, as well as bloating, burping and flatulence. GI gas may also be associated with functional and non-functional GI disorders; for additional information see Constipation, Diarrhea, and Dyspepsia and GERD. Also, in the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*, see Constipation in Adults, Diarrhea, Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

### Pathophysiology

The passage of gas is a normal daily process.​[[1]](#psc1034n1001) The gut typically contains about 200 mL of gas, while daily gas expulsion averages 500–700 mL.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[3]](#psc1034n1003) The main sources of GI gas include air swallowing, intraluminal bowel production of gases, and the movement or diffusion of gases from intestinal lumen and blood.​[[4]](#Koide2000) The main complaints about intestinal gas include excessive belching, abdominal distention (bloating) and flatus (see [Table 1](#psc1034n00003)).​[[1]](#psc1034n1001)​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[5]](#psc1034n1004) There is poor correlation between the volume of gas in the digestive tract and actual symptoms.​[[6]](#psc1034n01050)

Eructation: Eructation (belching) results from swallowing excessive air into the GI tract (aerophagia) or the ingestion of carbonated beverages. Aerophagia is a normal process occurring while people eat and drink. However, many individuals will swallow air unconsciously while smoking, when anxious or when trying to induce belching. Other causes of aerophagia include excessive salivation, respiratory disorders, not chewing food thoroughly, GI disorders (dyspepsia, acid reflux), some medications, gum chewing, ill-fitted dental apparatus and sensations of nausea. Eructation may also be a sign of more serious underlying GI disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroparesis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).​[[7]](#psc1034n1005)​[[8]](#psc1034n1006)​[[9]](#Kessing2014) Normally, most of the air swallowed is eructated to prevent excess accumulation of gas in the GI tract.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[7]](#psc1034n1005)​[[9]](#Kessing2014)​[[10]](#Disney2014)​[[11]](#Chitkara2005)

Abdominal Discomfort: The causes of abdominal discomfort (bloating, cramping or pain) vary and should be assessed thoroughly. Abdominal discomfort is often attributed to excess intestinal gas, although evidence does not always link it to these complaints. Abdominal discomfort may present in isolation or may occur as a result of underlying GI disorders: functional GI disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia), inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis), GERD, altered GI motility or colon cancer. Other conditions such as eating disorders (e.g., bulimia, anorexia) may also be associated with symptoms of abdominal discomfort. Some individuals have hypersensitive intestinal tracts, where minor changes in gas volume may result in abdominal discomfort.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)

Abdominal pain deserves a careful note because the region of pain may be confused in many cases with other medical conditions. Right-sided colonic pain may resemble gallstones or appendicitis, and left-sided colonic pain may be misdiagnosed in heart disease. Severe abdominal pain should be investigated promptly; other alarm symptoms are listed in [Table 2](#table-11335-4DC24DE7)).​[[7]](#psc1034n1005)

Flatulence: Gas is always present in the GI tract. The average person passes gas 10–25 times daily. The elderly may pass gas more frequently, but this is not well defined. Although there is considerable variability in the frequency and quantity of flatulence, passing gas more than 25 times a day may be considered excessive. Flatus results from the normal metabolic by-products of nonabsorbable foods digested and fermented by intestinal bacteria. Very little is due to aerophagia. The small intestine is unable to digest and absorb certain carbohydrates found in foods (e.g., fibre and nonabsorbable carbohydrates such as raffinose, stachyose and verbascose). As a result, the undigested food passes to the large intestine, where normal bacterial flora break down the food. The primary components of flatus are 5 gases: nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and oxygen. The odour of flatus stems from trace gases: skatoles, indoles and sulfur compounds. The frequency and quantity of flatus are related to an individual's diet and intestinal flora.​[[1]](#psc1034n1001)​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[5]](#psc1034n1004)

Common dietary sources of intestinal gas include lactose, fibre and other nonabsorbable carbohydrates. A deficiency of lactase in the GI tract permits lactose to reach the colon where it is metabolized into fatty acids and 2 gases: hydrogen and carbon dioxide.​[[1]](#psc1034n1001)​[[2]](#psc1034n1002) Lactase deficiency can be congenital or secondarily acquired.​[[12]](#DiCostanzo2018)

**Table 1:** Symptoms and Causes of Gastrointestinal Gas

| Symptoms | Causes |
| --- | --- |
| Eructation (belching) | Aerophagia (air swallowing): eating quickly, excessive salivation, gum chewing, mal-fitted dental apparatus, nausea, respiratory disorders, smoking Consumption of carbonated beverages |
| Abdominal discomfort (bloating, cramping, pain) | Aerophagia Cancer Diverticular disease Eating disorders (anorexia, binge eating, bulimia, compulsive eating) GI disorders: functional GI disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis), GI motility disorders, constipation |
| Flatus | Celiac disease/tropical sprue Dietary consumption: beans, complex carbohydrates, dairy, vegetables Disaccharidase deficiency (e.g., lactase, sucrase-isomaltase) Pancreatic insufficiency |

### Goals of Therapy

- Educate patients about the normal aspects of GI gas
- Relieve symptoms (belching, pain, bloating, flatulence)
- Educate patients regarding preventive measures

### Patient Assessment

The symptoms of gas are variable and subjective.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[3]](#psc1034n1003)​[[5]](#psc1034n1004)​[[7]](#psc1034n1005) An important first step is to review the patient history. Patients with eructation have signs of aerophagia, whereas flatus or abdominal discomfort may be associated with timing, quantity and type of foods consumed, bowel habits, or other underlying medical conditions. The history should also elicit any relevant medical conditions (respiratory disorders, recent gastroenteritis or GI disorders such as celiac disease, lactose intolerance or gastroparesis).

Patients with recurrent symptoms of abdominal fullness, distention or bloating relieved by defecation may have features of underlying irritable bowel syndrome. Weight loss associated with GI gas may suggest a malabsorption syndrome.

Be vigilant for red flags in the patient history. Patients must be investigated promptly if they present with alarm symptoms (see [Table 2](#table-11335-4DC24DE7)).​[[13]](#Stanghellini2016)

In general, testing for GI gas is not required. However, in some severe cases, testing for carbohydrate intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, bacterial cultures or endoscopic examinations may be warranted. [Figure 1](#psc1034n00008) outlines a general approach to assessing patients with GI gas.

**Table 2:** Alarm Symptoms Requiring Medical Investigation

| Abdominal pain (moderate to severe) or distention |
| Sudden unexplained changes in bowel movements |
| Blood in stool or vomit |
| Dysphagia |
| Dyspepsia |
| Fever or chills |
| Nausea or vomiting |
| Unintentional weight loss |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

The majority of patients have symptoms that do not require any treatment, but many may seek advice in selecting treatments for more excessive or intolerable symptoms. Typically, changes in diet and lifestyle allow for quick corrections in the symptoms of gas.

Eructation: Recognize the history and activities of aerophagia. Some patients gulp air with each belch. This is often associated with multiple small belches over seconds. Educating the patient to stop gulping air with each belch or instructing a forced cessation of belching should relieve this.​[[3]](#psc1034n1003) Adjusting poorly fitting dental apparatus or decreasing excess salivation by reducing gum chewing, cigar chomping or cigarette smoking can help improve eructation. Also, reducing ingestion of gas-producing or gas-releasing substances (e.g., carbonated beverages, sodium bicarbonate) may be helpful. Encourage patients to eat meals slowly to decrease the likelihood of gulping air when swallowing.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)​[[7]](#psc1034n1005)​[[8]](#psc1034n1006) Abdominal breathing exercises may also be considered.​[[9]](#Kessing2014)

GI discomfort: The feeling of bloating with the desire to belch can simply be due to overeating. Very large meals ingested in the late evening may induce symptoms; eating less and earlier in the day may reduce them. Physical activity may also help reduce abdominal bloating.​[[14]](#Villoria2006) Abdominal cramping may arise from a number of dietary and pharmaceutical sources, such as osmotic laxatives.​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)

Flatulence: Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day may help decrease symptoms. A proper exercise program may also help improve and maintain the function of the GI system and reduce gas production.​[[1]](#psc1034n1001)​[[2]](#psc1034n1002)

Following a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) is a reasonable option in the management of patients with functional gut symptoms;​[[15]](#Marsh2016) however, the available data is primarily in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and there is great variability in study parameters, which impacts the strength of recommendations. FODMAPs include fructans and galactans (oligosaccharides), lactose (disaccharides), fructose (monosaccharides), and mannitol and sorbitol (polyols or sugar alcohols). Foods rich in FODMAPs include apples, artichokes, cauliflower, garlic, honey, legumes, mangoes, milk, mushrooms, onions, pears, rye, stone fruits, sugar-free mints/gums, watermelons and wheat.​[[16]](#psc1034n01049)​[[17]](#Azpiroz2014) A registered dietitian can educate patients on a low FODMAP diet and ensure all nutritional needs are being met.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antacid, Antiflatulent and Antireflux; Nutrition Products: Lactose Digestants.

Evidence-based pharmacotherapy for GI gas is limited and no consensus guidelines for the management of this condition exist. Currently there is no evidence-based therapy for aerophagia; the proper approach and treatment for eructation is unclear. It is important to identify the underlying causes of eructation and correct them whenever possible. Otherwise, further medical evaluation for GI disorders such as GERD should be considered.

Information on selected therapies for GI gas can be found in [Table 3](#d46e337).

Activated charcoal tablets have not demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms of intestinal gas and should not be recommended.​[[5]](#psc1034n1004)​[[18]](#psc1034n1007) External charcoal devices for reducing odour can be effective in binding sulfur gases.​[[19]](#psc1034n1008) These devices exist as pads, cushions or briefs and may be useful depending on patient preference.

Alpha-d-galactosidase may be effective in reducing symptoms of flatus and abdominal discomfort associated with the consumption of nonabsorbable carbohydrates when not associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).​[[20]](#psc1034n1009)​[[21]](#Hillila2016) Enzyme products should not be put on hot foods (too hot to eat or during cooking), as heat renders the enzyme inactive. Instruct patients to place the liquid enzyme on the first spoonful of food.

The use of antibiotics in the general treatment of gas is not required. However, if bacterial overgrowth is suspected, antibiotics may be required.​[[22]](#psc1034n1010)

Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that has been studied in the reduction of eructation. It may reduce reflux, air swallowing and belching.​[[23]](#Blondeau2012) More research is needed to confirm these findings. Baclofen has CNS side effects that may limit longer-term use in eructation.

Bismuth subsalicylate is capable of binding a considerable amount of sulfide gas and reduces the odour associated with hydrogen sulfide. It may be very effective to provide short-term relief from the malodour of flatulence; however, long-term use is associated with salicylate toxicity. Do not recommend bismuth for >3–4 weeks of use or at doses >150 mg/kg.​[[24]](#psc1034n1011)​[[25]](#psc1034n1012)

Lactase supplementation taken with or prior to ingestion of lactose products can prevent flatulence in patients with lactase deficiency. The amount of supplementation required is dependent on the amount of lactose ingested. Dairy products with lactose should still be consumed in moderation, as large doses of lactose will not be completely broken down by the lactase supplement. Patients with suspected lactose malabsorption require further investigation for proper diagnosis.

Laxatives may have an important role in reducing symptoms of intestinal gas, notably those associated with constipation (see Constipation).

Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit. Although not all commonly used probiotics have been adequately studied in randomized controlled trials, some data have demonstrated a reduction in both short- and long-term symptoms of abdominal distention, bloating and gas. Commercially available products are not always consistent in the quantity and type of bacterial species combined.​[[26]](#psc1034n1013)​[[27]](#psc1034n1014)​[[28]](#psc1034n1015)​[[29]](#psc1034n1016)​[[30]](#Lacy2011)

Simethicone acts by preventing bubbling of liquids in the stomach and does not appear to be absorbed from the GI tract. However, data do not show a clear benefit in the reduction of symptoms from intestinal gas. Despite this fact, it is generally used for treatment of flatulence and abdominal bloating. Simethicone in combination with loperamide may be effective in reducing abdominal bloating and flatus associated with acute diarrhea.​[[31]](#psc1034n1017)

Information on selected therapies for GI gas can be found in [Table 3](#d46e337). Other specific pharmacotherapy options might be indicated if there is underlying pathology affecting GI motility, functional GI disorders (irritable bowel disease, inflammatory bowel disease) or infection.

### Natural Health Products

**Peppermint** probably acts by reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure, theoretically making it easier to pass gas from the stomach into the esophagus.​[[32]](#psc1034n1018) This pressure reduction potentially increases the likelihood of GERD.

**Garlic** and **ginger** are other alternative products promoted for treatment of intestinal gas. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Ensure patients are investigated further if alarm symptoms are present (see [Table 2](#table-11335-4DC24DE7)) or if their symptoms persist for more than 1–2 weeks despite pharmacotherapy.

Exclusion diets (e.g., diets free of lactose or nonabsorbable carbohydrates) should be monitored for effective resolution of symptoms. If symptoms persist, both diet and other sources of the triggers (e.g., lactose in medications and herbals) should be more rigorously evaluated.

Functional GI conditions presenting with symptoms of abdominal distention (bloating), pain and flatus may be chronic or intermittent and may be managed only partially with pharmacotherapy. It is important to be positive and reassure patients with functional GI disorders that these symptoms are not detrimental to their health and that they are experienced by everyone as part of a healthy digestive process. It is also important to appreciate that patients’ perceptions of symptoms of GI gas are individual and the impact on quality of life may be significant, e.g., isolation as a result of avoiding social interactions.
