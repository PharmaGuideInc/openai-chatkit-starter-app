### Introduction

Pharyngitis is defined as the inflammation of the pharynx, tonsils or nasopharynx; it can have infectious and noninfectious causes. Acute pharyngitis is defined as the presence of pharyngitis symptoms for a duration of less than 2 weeks.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)

The infectious etiology of acute pharyngitis can be diverse. In all age groups, pharyngitis is commonly due to a viral etiology, regardless of group A streptococcus (GAS) colonization. For a list of possible infectious causes of pharyngitis, see the [Infectious Diseases Society of America group A streptococcal pharyngitis guidelines](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/55/10/e86/321183).​[[2]](#c0089n00152)

GAS is estimated to cause 5–15% of acute pharyngitis cases in adults and 20–30% in children (especially in the 5–15 year age group); it is most prevalent in winter through spring (November–May) and is the most common and important cause of *bacterial* pharyngitis.​[[2]](#c0089n00152) Asymptomatic GAS carriage also varies with season and age; in the winter and spring months, over 20% of school-aged children may be colonized at peak times.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs) Rates of oropharyngeal carriage by age are as follows:​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)

- ≤14 years of age: 10.9%
- 15–44 years of age: 2.3%
- ≥45 years of age: 0.6%

Although generally now recognized as a self-limited infection, its medical importance (historically) is noted by acute rheumatic fever (ARF), its most significant postinfectious nonsuppurative complication. In Canada, contemporary rates of ARF have fallen significantly and are estimated at approximately 3 cases per million per year for ages 0–19.​[[3]](#CPSPHAC2007) However, according to one report, rates may be up to 70 times higher in the Indigenous population, postulated to be due to systemic health inequities, such as inadequate access to health care, overcrowded housing.​​[[4]](#Gordon_CFP)

Patients at low risk of developing ARF after GAS pharyngitis include those who have:​[[5]](#GewitzMHBaltimoreRSTaniLYEtAl.Revis-913A7689)

- No prior ARF diagnosis
- An ancestry other than indigenous (see above)
- Resided long term in a developed country
- Resided in an area where local ARF incidence is <2 cases per 100 000 school-aged children (5–14 years of age) per year (where epidemiological data are available and reliable)

### Goals of Therapy

- Provide symptomatic relief
- Shorten duration of symptoms
- Prevent nonsuppurative complications, e.g., ARF
- Prevent suppurative complications, e.g., peritonsillar abscess (quinsy); acute otitis media; acute sinusitis; cervical lymphadenitis; very rare: bacteremia, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis
- Limit spread of GAS to close contacts

### Investigations

Assessment with clinical and (where applicable) laboratory testing helps to improve diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic prescribing quality (see [Figure 1](#c0089n00004)).​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)​[[2]](#c0089n00152) Generally, a clinical diagnosis alone should *not* be the trigger for antibiotic prescribing.

### Clinical Features

- There are no specific features that differentiate GAS pharyngitis from other causes of sore throat (e.g., respiratory viruses),​[[2]](#c0089n00152)​[[6]](#EbellMHSmithMABarryHCEtAl.JAMA) especially in children and during respiratory viral season. Common signs and symptoms that suggest the diagnosis include:

  - Acute sore/painful throat
  - Fever
  - Tender cervical adenopathy
  - Erythematous pharynx and tonsils +/- pharyngeal exudate
  - Scarlatiniform rash
  - Absence of features consistent with viral upper respiratory tract infection, e.g., cough, rhinorrhea, hoarseness, conjunctivitis, stomatits/oral ulcers, exanthema, diarrhea, anosmia (loss of sense of smell), ageusia (loss of sense of taste)
- Determining the pretest probability of GAS pharyngitis is necessary when interpreting clinical features in order to identify which children and adults will benefit from laboratory testing. A modified Centor scoring system​[[7]](#ModifiedCentor) (or similar validated clinical tool) can be a helpful guide in assessing pretest probability for GAS pharyngitis, as determined using the criteria listed in [Table 1](#c0089n10009).

  - In adults, it is useful if the cumulative score is 3 or 4, as this increases the likelihood that the patient has GAS pharyngitis (28–35% and 51–53%, respectively).​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)
  - In children ≥3 years of age, although there are some concerns pertaining to the accuracy of the diagnosis given higher rates of GAS colonization and a more nonspecific clinical presentation, e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis for any pharyngitis. Assessing for the absence of a viral syndrome is of critical importance.

### Laboratory Testing

Given the rates of oropharyngeal carriage, positive results from any testing modality are indicative only of GAS colonization and therefore must be correlated with the clinical assessment (i.e., modified Centor score), the individual’s risk for ARF and the results of respiratory viral studies (if available).

- The sensitivity of both the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and throat culture is influenced by quality of the collection technique; performance of RADT can vary based on the manufacturer.​[[2]](#c0089n00152)
- Laboratory testing is recommended for all suspect cases in order to improve diagnostic specificity by ascertaining the presence or absence of GAS in the oropharynx; see [Table 2](#c0089n10008) for a description of each test.

  - Adults:

    - A positive RADT or culture supports the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis with an appropriate clinical picture
    - A negative RADT (or initial culture) does not require further routine testing; however, if the patient is at high risk of ARF, follow-up (or repeat) culture is recommended
  - Children/Adolescents:

    - A positive RADT or culture supports the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis with an appropriate clinical picture
    - When a RADT is negative, a throat culture should be performed to confirm, especially if risk of ARF is a concern, e.g., 5–15 years of age, past history of ARF, Indigenous populations or those from developing countries
    - Testing in atypical presentations for GAS or in acute pharyngitis in patients under 3 years of age should be on a case-by-case basis, e.g., if there is concern for ARF​[[2]](#c0089n00152)
    - Given higher rates of GAS carriage, avoid testing patients who have signs/symptoms of a viral infection (see [Clinical Features](#ClinicalDiagnosis)), especially if the risk of ARF is low
  - In all patients with a low risk of ARF and lacking suppurative complications, the value of laboratory testing is to confirm the presence of GAS so that the potential value of antibiotics in those with severe symptoms (i.e., modified Centor score 3–4) can be established; see [Pharmacologic Choices](#c0089n00010) for more information.
  - Historically, it has been difficult to access and receive outpatient respiratory viral testing in a timely manner, which could impact diagnostic and/or therapeutic decisions. Newer point of care and molecular technologies could allow for more sensitive and rapid results but are not yet widely in clinical use. One exception is the broad community use of rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2, which may assist in diagnosing a viral etiology of pharyngitis.

### Prevention

- Hand hygiene and respiratory/cough etiquette may minimize transmission to household or close contacts.
- GAS carriers have a low risk of both postinfectious complications and person-to-person transmission and should not be routinely treated.​[[11]](#TanzRRShulmanST.ChronicPharyngealCa-6AB33BB8)
- Treatment of asymptomatic GAS contacts is not routinely recommended.​[[2]](#c0089n00152)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Supportive care includes fluid intake, rest and soft diet
- Symptomatic relief from hot items (e.g., tea), cold items (e.g., ice, popsicles) or candies as needed

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Analgesics

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be given for fever and throat pain in adults and children with generally equivalent results.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs) Medicated lozenges, sprays and gargles may provide modest aid in the symptomatic treatment of sore throat but are not superior to other symptomatic relief remedies for the cost.​[[12]](#NICEGuideline-74658384)​[[13]](#scottish)

### Corticosteroids

When used with over-the-counter analgesics (with or without antibiotics), adjunctive therapy with a single dose of dexamethasone appears to provide additional symptomatic relief in non-hospitalized adults and children.​[[14]](#c0089n00153)​[[15]](#SadeghiradBSiemieniukRACBrignardell-6E37F755) Compared with placebo, at 24 hours post-steroid administration, an additional 12% of patients experienced complete resolution of pain, with an average of 11 hours to effect.​[[15]](#SadeghiradBSiemieniukRACBrignardell-6E37F755) However, guidelines do not routinely recommend steroid use given the small magnitude of the benefit (an average drop of 1.3 points on a 10-point visual pain scale at 24 hours), the confounding effects of antibiotics on pain relief and the concerns over causing relapse. In patients with severe pain, case-by-case consideration of corticosteroids is reasonable after a patient-centred discussion around the merits of this intervention.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)​[[12]](#NICEGuideline-74658384)

### Antibiotics

[Table 3](#c0089n00012) presents information regarding dosing and duration of antibacterials in the treatment of GAS pharyngitis.

Benefits of antibiotics are generally seen only for pharyngitis caused by GAS. Antibiotics are not generally recommended for other causes of pharyngitis; however, some unusual bacterial causes (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae) do require therapy.​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)

With the proper clinical presentation, a positive RADT and/or throat culture is an indication to consider treatment with antibiotics. Conversely, a negative throat culture routinely allows the withholding of antibiotics in the vast majority of patients (see [Figure 1](#c0089n00004)).

- For adults, a negative RADT (or throat culture) is sufficient to routinely withhold antibiotics, especially given a low incidence of new ARF in this age group.
- For children and adolescents (or those with a high pretest probability for GAS pharyngitis, see [Table 1](#c0089n10009)), antibiotics can be withheld for 24–48 hours while awaiting the results of a throat culture (if RADT negative or not available). This approach does not increase the risk of ARF​[[10]](#c0089n00143) and avoids the unnecessary use of antibiotics.
- Antibiotics given within 9 days of symptom onset will prevent ARF in children.​[[18]](#WannamakerLWRammelkampCHJrDennyFWEt-6AB2EE1C)

### Should Antibiotics Be Used to Achieve the Goals of Therapy?

In cases that meet both clinical and laboratory criteria, determining the risk for ARF is the critical first step when deciding whether antibiotics should be prescribed.

- When ARF risk is not low:
  - The evidence supports the routine use of antibiotics to prevent ARF. Although this data relies on studies from the 1950s, when rates of ARF were much higher than present day (1.7% in placebo groups), antibiotics reduced ARF by at least 66% versus the placebo group.​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)
  - In 5 trials performed after 1990, no cases of ARF were noted in either group.​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)
  - It is unclear if post-GAS glomerulonephritis is prevented with therapy based on the same older studies.​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)
- When ARF risk is low:

  - Modern studies on the benefits of antibiotics in GAS pharyngitis have focused on symptomatic improvement, but these have generally occurred in populations and countries at low risk for ARF.​[[19]](#AltamimiSKhalilAKhalaiwiEtAl.Short--6AB62883)​[[20]](#VanDrielMLDeSutterAIHabrakenHEtAl.D-6AB67582) Outcomes focusing on the harms of antibiotic therapy are not well studied.
  - In a Cochrane review, compared with placebo, patients with laboratory-confirmed GAS pharyngitis treated with antibiotics were half as likely to have pain or headache at day 3. There was no significant reduction of fever by day 3 (85% fever-free in control group). Given the high spontaneous recovery seen in the placebo groups by day 7 (40% and 82% pain-free by day 3 and 7, respectively), the benefit is modest at best when given early.​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)
  - Use of antibiotics for the routine prevention of suppurative complications is not recommended with modern-day health care. The risk of common complications (e.g., acute otitis media, peritonsillar abscess) was reduced with antibiotics but not for acute sinusitis.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348) These benefits appear more pronounced in older studies (NNT for acute otitis media was 50 before 1975 and 200 after 1975).​[[17]](#SpinksGlasziouDelMar-74674348)
- Given the small benefit of therapy, antibiotics are not recommended to reduce severity for mild symptoms but could be considered in those with severe symptoms. A balanced discussion on antibiotic harms and benefits is advised, especially given the difference in outcomes in older versus newer studies.
- Worsening symptoms, failure to improve and the development of suppurative complications would be reasonable indications to reassess the need for therapy.
- Treatment of asymptomatic patient with chronic carriage is not recommended.

### Choice of Antibiotic

- Penicillin V (or amoxicillin) is the drug of choice for streptococcal sore throat.​[[21]](#c0089n00142) Amoxicillin is often used in children requiring a liquid formulation in Canada.​[[21]](#c0089n00142)
- There are treatment options for penicillin-allergic patients; however, they are not as well studied.

  - For patients who do not have an immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillin, narrow spectrum cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin) can be used.​[[21]](#c0089n00142)
  - For patients with an IgE-mediated anaphylactic hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin or macrolides (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) are recommended.
- There is no clear benefit of one antibiotic class over another with respect to faster symptomatic improvement or relapses; however, given the narrow spectrum, cost and safety profile of penicillins, the routine use of non-penicillin antibiotics is not recommended.​[[20]](#VanDrielMLDeSutterAIHabrakenHEtAl.D-6AB67582)
- Penicillin resistance in GAS has never been documented and is not a reason to routinely change antibiotic classes upon suspected clinical relapse. In penicillin-allergic patients, if clindamycin or macrolide therapy was used, consult local susceptibility rates (if available; given the rising resistance rates) before re-prescribing.

### Duration of Antibiotic

- Ten days of penicillins (i.e., penicillin V or amoxicillin) remains the gold standard for therapeutic duration, especially in patients at increased risk of ARF, as it increases the likelihood of oropharyngeal clearance.​[[1]](#EuropeanGLs)
- Shorter courses (i.e., ≤7 days) of penicillins can be utilized when attempting to reduce symptom severity only. Shorter durations have been associated with slightly worse clinical outcomes in the older literature, but this should be weighed in view of possible antibiotic harms.
- Shorter courses of non-penicillin antibiotics appear equivalent to 10 days of penicillins in children at low risk for ARF. This may allow for symptomatic improvement; however, this approach is not routinely recommended​[[19]](#AltamimiSKhalilAKhalaiwiEtAl.Short--6AB62883) with the exception of azithromycin, which is typically given for 5 days (see [Table 3](#c0089n00012)).

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Management during Pregnancy

The diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis are generally not altered in the pregnancy setting. Penicillin V, amoxicillin and cephalosporins are considered safe in pregnancy.​[[22]](#Briggs-6E3AD6E7) For penicillin-allergic patients, azithromycin and clindamycin can be used.​[[22]](#Briggs-6E3AD6E7)

### Management during Breastfeeding

Penicillin V, amoxicillin, cephalosporins and macrolides are considered safe for use in breastfeeding patients.​[[23]](#c0089n00155) Clindamycin is also a viable option; however, monitor the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, e.g., diarrhea, candidiasis, etc.​[[23]](#c0089n00155)​[[24]](#FerreiraGrossesse-6E3C9AB2)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- There remain differences in various guidelines around the diagnosis and treatment strategies for GAS pharyngitis, especially as it relates to antibiotic use to manage symptoms given the evidence of its otherwise self-limited nature and low baseline risk of complications.
- The major benefit in treating GAS pharyngitis is to reduce the risk of developing ARF, as seen in older, lower-quality studies. Given lower contemporary rates of ARF in North America, the role of routine antibiotics in GAS pharyngitis is uncertain.
- It is recommended for all cases with ARF risk factors to be treated with approved antibiotics within 9 days of onset.
- Empiric therapy in patients not at risk for ARF is not routinely recommended, especially given the risk for antibiotic harm and the need to improve antimicrobial stewardship.
- There are limited studies that examine the causes of pharyngitis from a broad pathogen perspective, especially in the era of molecular virological detection. This increases the probability of overtreating patients who have demonstrated GAS colonization.
