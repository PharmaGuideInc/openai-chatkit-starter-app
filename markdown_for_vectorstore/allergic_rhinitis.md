### Introduction

Allergic rhinitis is a common problem in Canada. It can be classified as seasonal or perennial or, using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification, intermittent or persistent. Poor symptom control results in increased economic burden, absenteeism and reduced productivity (at work or school), secondary infections, and inappropriate use of antibiotics.​[[1]](#c0036n00347)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent allergic symptoms from occurring by avoiding exposure to allergens
- Suppress and control symptoms produced by the allergic response
- Avoid/minimize medication side effects, including negative impact on activities of daily living
- Minimize interference with school or work performance/attendance, leisure activities, sleep

### Investigations

- Clinical history (see [Table 1](#c0036n00035)) with particular attention to:

  - symptoms (congestion, nasal itch, rhinorrhea, sneezing, postnasal drip, ocular), frequency and severity
  - duration and pattern of symptoms (intermittent, persistent)
  - precipitating factors, e.g., environmental allergens such as animal dander and pollen
  - personal or family history of allergy and/or atopy
  - comorbid medical conditions (apnea/snoring, asthma, conjunctivitis)
  - medication history: intermittent use of ASA or NSAIDs may precipitate nasal symptoms in ASA-intolerant individuals; some drugs (e.g., ACE inhibitors, sildenafil, etc.) may cause nasal congestion
  - patient history of self-treatment (e.g., over-the-counter medications) and its efficacy in controlling symptoms
- Physical examination (see [Table 1](#c0036n00035)):

  - nasal mucosa (e.g., colour, anatomy), using ordinary otoscope
  - infraorbital edema (allergic shiners)
  - ocular redness or swelling
  - transverse nasal crease
  - cobblestone posterior oropharynx
  - postnasal drip evident on exam
- Objective measurements:

  - skin testing:

    - confirms allergic sensitivity, if present; identifying the causative allergens can aid in appropriate avoidance measures and confirm the diagnosis
    - generally preferred over serum IgE testing, unless conditions exist that make it unsatisfactory, e.g., widespread skin disease or inability to stop antihistamine therapy.
    - antihistamines should be discontinued temporarily (for at least 3 days prior to skin testing); tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines as well as other drugs with antihistaminic effect (e.g., dimenhydrinate) may also interfere with skin testing, but should be discontinued only after discussion with the patient
  - in vitro measurements of allergen-specific IgE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, previously performed by RAST, or radioallergosorbent testing) are acceptable, but more expensive and less sensitive than skin testing
  - there is little benefit in measuring total serum IgE, which does not correlate well with presence of allergic disease

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Rhinitis

| Condition | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis | Nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea are common. Often conjunctival symptoms, paroxysmal sneezing, itching of the nasal mucosa and oropharynx. Seasonal patterns may be recognized, or perennial symptoms may flare up after exposure to allergens like dust mites or animal danders. Nasal mucosa is swollen, often pale or bluish, and moist. Other symptoms: transverse nasal crease, infraorbital edema (allergic shiners), red/swollen eyes, cobblestoning of the posterior pharynx, evidence of postnasal drip. |
| Upper respiratory infection | More episodic (duration of a cold is about 7–10 days ); often associated with sore throat or fever and not associated with itch. Nasal mucosa is often red. |
| Vasomotor rhinitis | Profuse, watery rhinorrhea is prominent with or without congestion or sneezing. May be triggered by irritant exposures such as smoke, temperature changes, strong odours, cold air, and other factors such as exercising or eating hot or spicy foods. |
| Nasal polyp | Nasal obstruction is main complaint. Anosmia and reduced taste perception are almost always present. Nasal exam will usually detect a polyp. |

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0036n00007) provides an algorithm for the management of allergic rhinitis.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Patients should avoid exposure to allergens to which they are sensitized, as this will reduce medication use:​[[1]](#c0036n00347)​[[2]](#c0036n00048)

- Pollen: using air conditioning (to allow for closing windows) will reduce exposure. Nasal filters (e.g., Rhinix filters) reduce exposure of the nasal cavity to pollen and other allergens. They have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials by reducing nasal and ophthalmic symptoms.​[[3]](#OMearaTJ-1720E375)
- Animal dander: removing pets from the home will reduce perennial symptoms caused by exposure.
- Dust mites: avoidance measures such as impermeable covers for the mattress and pillows may reduce exposure. Previous studies have been small and of poor quality;​[[4]](#ARIA2010)​[[5]](#c0036n00425)​[[6]](#SheikhAHurwitzBNurmatovUEtAl.HouseD-8F437AC2) however, a recent study in dust mite-allergic asthmatics showed a reduction in asthma-related emergency department visits over the following 12-month period.​[[7]](#Murray-17211E8F) Use of acaricides (products used to kill mites) have been recommended, but evidence has shown minimal benefit in reducing symptoms,​[[4]](#ARIA2010)​[[6]](#SheikhAHurwitzBNurmatovUEtAl.HouseD-8F437AC2) and the long-term safety of the regular use of acaricides on bedding is unknown.

### Pharmacologic Choices

**Intranasal saline sprays** or irrigation systems can help relieve symptoms by washing out mucus and the inhaled allergen;​[[8]](#HeadK-1ABE8415) however, only distilled water or boiled/cooled water should be used to make the solution, and the irrigation system should be routinely cleaned. **Lubricant eye drops** or cold or warm compresses can reduce conjunctival symptoms.

Information on oral drugs used in the management of allergic rhinitis can be found in [Table 2](#c0036n00213).

### Antihistamines

Antihistamines help relieve most symptoms of acute allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itch and conjunctivitis and, to a lesser degree, reduce subjective nasal congestion. Bilastine,​[[9]](#Kuna-63DDCD06) cetirizine,​[[9]](#Kuna-63DDCD06) desloratadine,​[[10]](#c0036n00361)​[[11]](#BachertC.AReviewOfTheEfficacyOfDesl-8F4B6C1A)​[[12]](#c0036n00385) fexofenadine​[[11]](#BachertC.AReviewOfTheEfficacyOfDesl-8F4B6C1A)​[[12]](#c0036n00385) and rupatadine​[[13]](#Compalati-63DE7074) have evidence to support their effects on nasal congestion; however, only desloratadine is officially indicated specifically for congestion. Compared with oral antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids are more effective for congestion and consistently make an objective difference (see [Intranasal Therapy](#c0036n00123)).​[[14]](#Bhatia-20EEB759)

Antihistamines are most effective if used prophylactically; however, onset of action is fast enough that they are also effective when used on an as-needed basis. Once-daily dosing of the newer antihistamines is usually sufficient. In one study, rupatadine showed a 15‑minute onset of effect when used prophylactically for 8 days in an allergen-controlled chamber experiment.​[[15]](#Stuebner-63DEF29C) Bilastine has also been compared prophylactically to cetirizine and fexofenadine (in a similar chamber experiment); all had a similar onset of effect, but fexofenadine’s duration of effect was reduced compared to the other agents.​[[16]](#Horak-63DF7B99)

Although sedation and anticholinergic side effects are common with the older antihistamines (also known as first-generation or sedating antihistamines), these side effects are usually not seen with newer agents (second-generation or less-sedating antihistamines). Patients who are unaware of sedation may be impaired with respect to attention, memory, vigilance and speed. These effects persist into the next day. Caution is advised in the elderly, as they may be more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of the sedating antihistamines. Patients whose occupations require vigilance or concentration should receive only less-sedating antihistamines, as they do not affect performance and have no anticholinergic effects.​[[1]](#c0036n00347)​[[17]](#c0036n00049)​[[18]](#c0036n00054)​[[19]](#c0036n00336)​[[20]](#c0036n00348) Bilastine and rupatadine were shown to have no effect on driving performance.​[[21]](#Conen-63F59F46)​[[22]](#Vuurman-63F5EAD4) Of the less-sedating antihistamines, cetirizine is more likely to cause some sedation, especially at higher doses. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of adverse effects, and dosage modification may be required (see [Table 2](#c0036n00213)). The currently available, less-sedating antihistamines (including bilastine) have not been shown to cause QTc interval prolongation.​[[23]](#Gonzalez-63F65C0B)​[[24]](#Graff-63F5EE28)

Although older studies of long-term dosing with sedating antihistamines have demonstrated loss of effectiveness, they are flawed by lack of evidence of adherence to therapy.

For information related to other antihistamine preparations, see [Intranasal Antihistamine-Corticosteroid Combinations](#ComboTx) and [Ophthalmic Therapy](#c0036n00125).

### Decongestants (Alpha-Adrenergic Agonists)

Oral decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) relieve nasal obstruction; however, the effectiveness of phenylephrine in improving nasal congestion has not been well established, and unlike pseudoephedrine, it is not available as a single-entity product or in combination with a less-sedating antihistamine.​[[25]](#c0036n00386) Some individuals are intolerant of the stimulant side effects of decongestants. Avoid oral decongestants in those receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Use decongestants with caution in patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism or ischemic heart disease, though evidence of an associated risk is weak when they are used at recommended doses.​[[26]](#c0036n00051)

For information related to intranasal therapy, see [Intranasal Decongestants](#INDecong).

### Antihistamine-Decongestant Combinations

Antihistamines and decongestants have complementary effects, and patients taking both drugs may find combination products convenient. Combinations that include the less-sedating second-generation antihistamines are preferred. Avoid antihistamine-decongestant combinations with additional ingredients such as analgesics and expectorants (e.g., cold preparations), which have not been found to be helpful in allergic rhinitis.​[[27]](#StormsWFarrarJR.GaifenesinInRhiniti-D6D08324)

### Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists

Montelukast has a modest effect on allergic rhinitis, showing similar benefit to oral antihistamines but less than INCS in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with seasonal symptoms.​[[28]](#c0036n00340)​[[29]](#c0036n00362)​[[30]](#c0036n00363)​[[31]](#SeidmanMDGurgelRKLinSYEtAl.Clinical-1F102837)​[[32]](#GraingerJDrake-LeeA.MontelukastInAl-1F106F48) Consider montelukast as monotherapy or add-on therapy with INCS or oral antihistamines in patients with concomitant asthma or nasal polyps, or in patients who have failed to respond to adequate trials of first-line therapies (INCS or oral or intranasal antihistamines).​[[28]](#c0036n00340)​[[29]](#c0036n00362)​[[30]](#c0036n00363)​[[31]](#SeidmanMDGurgelRKLinSYEtAl.Clinical-1F102837)​[[32]](#GraingerJDrake-LeeA.MontelukastInAl-1F106F48)

In a seasonal allergic rhinitis trial, montelukast monotherapy was shown to reduce blood eosinophils, which was not observed in the oral antihistamine group;​[[33]](#PhilipG-1729334C) however, INCS are more effective at reducing nasal eosinophils when compared with montelukast or antihistamines.​[[34]](#PulleritsT-172963CC) Reducing eosinophils may indicate a reduction in the late allergic response; this may prevent persistent symptoms.

### Intranasal Therapy

Intranasal medications for the treatment of allergic rhinitis are described in [Table 3](#c0036n00265).

### Intranasal Corticosteroids

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS, e.g., beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone **furoate**, **fluticasone propionate**, mometasone and triamcinolone) are the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe rhinitis symptoms. When compared with an oral antihistamine and leukotriene antagonist, INCS monotherapy has been shown to be more effective, especially at relieving congestion.​[[25]](#c0036n00386) Although some patients may experience adequate symptom relief with use of INCS on an as-needed basis during allergy season, continuous use more effectively provides symptom relief. In addition, INCS are effective in managing ocular symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.​[[37]](#BieloryLChunYBieloryBPEtAl.ImpactOf-D6D1E546)​[[38]](#ScaddingGKKeithPK.FluticasoneFuroat-D6D232EC) Some preparations (e.g., fluticasone furoate) have a lower spray volume, which may be preferred by some. A 2- to 4-week trial may be needed to see maximal effect, although benefit was seen on the first day of therapy compared to placebo in controlled trials. Budesonide is available as a dry powder nasal inhaler and offers an alternative for those who dislike aqueous sprays.

Intranasal corticosteroids act locally and are quickly metabolized once absorbed. Adrenal suppression has not been seen at therapeutic dosages.​[[20]](#c0036n00348)​[[39]](#c0036n00052)​[[40]](#c0036n00053)​[[41]](#FanYMaLPippinsJEtAl.ImpactOfStudyDe-8F4BDBD5) Systemic effects appear to be related to dose and oral bioavailability. Generally, the recommended doses of INCS for allergic rhinitis in adults would not have a systemic effect. There have been case reports of nasal septal perforation in patients using INCS; however, this potential adverse effect has not been confirmed in controlled studies.​[[42]](#c0036n00055) Nevertheless, instruct patients to aim the spray at the turbinates, i.e., inside the nose, pointing upwards and angled laterally toward the tip of the ear, not medially at the septum.

Evidence is insufficient to support a significant difference in quality of life measures or symptom scores between intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy and intranasal corticosteroid/oral antihistamine combination therapy.​[[43]](#c0036n00349)​[[44]](#c0036n00417)​[[45]](#c0036n00418) Results are mixed; some studies found superiority for the combination in some patient-rated nasal symptoms but not quality of life scores.​[[43]](#c0036n00349)​[[44]](#c0036n00417) A subsequent study found that adding an antihistamine over the first 2 weeks of therapy did not result in a difference that was clinically meaningful in any measure.​[[45]](#c0036n00418) If allergic rhinitis is not adequately controlled with intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy, the addition of an antihistamine may be considered but should be discontinued if no benefit is observed within 2–4 weeks.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)

### Intranasal Antihistamine-Corticosteroid Combinations

Azelastine/​fluticasone combination intranasal spray is available for treatment of allergic rhinitis and ocular symptoms in patients over 12 years of age. Studies found that the combination is superior to fluticasone propionate or azelastine alone for nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal itch and eye symptoms. Consider using the combination product for patients who continue to have symptoms despite an adequate trial of INCS​[[46]](#CarrWBernsteinJLiebermanPEtAl.ANove-6E6CFE7E)​[[47]](#MeltzerERatnerPBachertCEtAl.Clinica-6E6D2ED1) or when it is important to have a more rapid onset of action (i.e., within the first 2 wk of therapy). Initial trials comparing the combination with corticosteroid alone were of 14 days’ duration, which is insufficient for assessment of maximal effect of the corticosteroid.​[[46]](#CarrWBernsteinJLiebermanPEtAl.ANove-6E6CFE7E)​[[47]](#MeltzerERatnerPBachertCEtAl.Clinica-6E6D2ED1)​[[48]](#GlacyJPutnamKGodfreySEtAl.Treatment-6E6DB318)

### Intranasal Decongestants

For patients experiencing significant congestion despite regular use of INCS, consider as-needed or ongoing use of intranasal decongestants in combination with an intranasal corticosteroid. Topical nasal decongestants available in Canada include oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.

The use of intranasal decongestants for more than 3–7 days may result in rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion). Concomitant use of an intranasal corticosteroid is important, as it may mitigate the rebound congestion that occurs with intranasal decongestant monotherapy.​[[49]](#ThongngarmTAssanasenPPradubpongsaPE-9803EBD7)​[[50]](#BaroodyFMBrownDGavanescuLEtAl.Oxyme-98042045)​[[51]](#MeltzerEOBernsteinDIPrennerBMEtAl.M-98046059) In a small study of short duration, fluticasone **propionate** intranasal spray was shown to begin reversing the rebound congestion when used for 3 days or longer in patients who had developed rhinitis medicamentosa.​[[52]](#VaidyanathanSWilliamsonPClearieKEtA-9804A0CE) Larger studies are required to better define the time to effect and ideal duration of therapy and possible adverse effects.

### Other Intranasal Therapies

Intranasal ipratropium reduces the volume of watery nasal discharge.​[[53]](#c0036n00339) It may be used when rhinorrhea is the only symptom or when rhinorrhea is refractory to topical INCS and/or antihistamines. This may be especially helpful in some types of vasomotor rhinitis, e.g., “skier’s nose.”

Sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) nasal sprays have an excellent safety profile but are less effective than corticosteroids and usually need QID dosing.​[[54]](#c0036n00424) Onset of action is 4–7 days but full benefit may not be evident for weeks.​[[25]](#c0036n00386) Currently, sodium cromoglycate is not available in Canada.

### Ophthalmic Therapy

Ophthalmic preparations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis are described in [Table 4](#c0036n00266).

When oral antihistamines, INCS or leukotriene receptor antagonists provide insufficient relief, topical ophthalmic antihistamines (ketotifen, olopatadine) provide ocular symptom relief in minutes with a duration of effect of about 12 hours.​[[55]](#OlopatadineForTheTreatmentOfAllergi-8F5A392A)​[[56]](#CastilloMScottNWMustafaMZEtAl.Topic-91462B2D) Olopatadine is available in a once-daily formulation.

Ophthalmic mast cell stabilizers (sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide) require several days for onset of effect; they are administered QID for optimal benefit.

Regular use of topical vasoconstrictors, such as naphazoline, oxymetazoline or phenylephrine, is discouraged because of development of rebound vasodilation.

### Immunotherapy

Desensitization (immunotherapy; “allergy shots”) is useful, especially for symptoms caused by pollen or dust mites.​[[57]](#c0036n00341)​[[58]](#c0036n00338) Immunotherapy is indicated only when there is evidence of IgE-dependent sensitivity to a specific antigen the patient cannot effectively avoid and when frequency and severity of symptoms are difficult to control with conventional drug therapy.​[[58]](#c0036n00338)​[[59]](#c0036n00047) A long-term follow-up of children who received immunotherapy for 3 years showed clinical benefits and reduced risk of asthma development up to 7 years after cessation of immunotherapy.​[[60]](#c0036n00391) Sublingual immunotherapy is now available in Canada for grass and ragweed pollen as well as house dust mites and will soon be available for birch tree pollen. This therapy may be administered at home after an initial dose is received under medical supervision. As with subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy has a persistent benefit after being administered for 3 years.​[[61]](#c0036n00421) When comparing subcutaneous and sublingual grass pollen immunotherapy over 2 years, both were superior to placebo and had similar benefit; however, the benefits of both interventions were lost if therapy was stopped after 2 years.​[[62]](#Scadding1739F534)

### Allergic Rhinitis in Children

Poorly controlled rhinitis impacts childrens’ quality of life significantly; it can lead to reduced learning performance, anxiety and social difficulties with friends and family.​[[63]](#c0036n00346)

Treatment of rhinitis symptoms in children is hampered by the difficulty of administering nasal sprays to children as most do not like the idea of spraying something into their nose. Lower volume nasal sprays (e.g., fluticasone furoate) tend to be better tolerated​[[64]](#Yanez-20EFDB4A) and are more effective than oral antihistamines in children.​[[65]](#Jordana-20F04C4E)​[[66]](#Bender-20F206BA) If antihistamines are used, **less-sedating** antihistamines are preferred, as sedating antihistamines are associated with drowsiness and learning impairment.​[[67]](#Church-63F71ABC)

Among the nasal preparations, cromoglycate is safe; however, it is not currently available in Canada. Intranasal corticosteroids are also effective.​[[1]](#c0036n00347)

Oral cough and cold preparations containing decongestants with or without sedating antihistamines are not to be used in children younger than 6 years of age for the treatment of viral or allergic rhinitis;​[[68]](#c0036n00392) Health Canada came to this decision based on limited evidence of efficacy in viral rhinitis and reported adverse effects.

### Intranasal Corticosteroid Impact on Growth in Children

Many parents are concerned over the effect of INCS on growth. Mometasone and fluticasone **propionate** have usually been recommended because of low oral bioavailability and absence of growth suppression with long-term use.​[[69]](#c0036n00419)​[[70]](#c0036n00420) However, fluticasone propionate is scented and many children prefer unscented preparations. Mometasone and fluticasone furoate are available unscented; fluticasone furoate has the lowest volume of the intranasal corticosteroid sprays. If liquid sprays are not tolerated, the dry powder formulation of budesonide may be tried (Turbuhaler). Budesonide 64 mcg once daily had no effect on growth.​[[71]](#MurphyKUryniakTSimpsonBEtAl.GrowthV-8F505AAB)

Intranasal corticosteroids that have been found to affect growth in children include high-dose beclomethasone (168 mcg BID),​[[72]](#c0036n00400) the smallest (and recommended) dose of over-the-counter triamcinolone (110 mcg/day)​[[73]](#SkonerDPBergerWEGawchikSMEtAl.Intra-8F5023E2) and twice the usual (but Health Canada–approved) dose in children of fluticasone **furoate** (110 mcg/day);​[[74]](#LeeLASterlinRMxe1speroJEtAl.GrowthV-8F50B709) it is not known if this growth reduction would be recovered at some point in future. There are no published growth studies for ciclesonide.

Once-daily dosing of INCS in the morning may reduce risk of growth suppression, since it would more closely follow diurnal variation.​[[20]](#c0036n00348) Studies comparing impact on growth of once-daily and twice-daily INCS are needed to confirm if growth is less affected with once-daily dosing. Any risk of decreased growth may be increased when total corticosteroid use is increased (e.g., intranasal use plus inhaled corticosteroids for asthma). Few studies have addressed this question; however, one study found no signs of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis suppression when intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids were combined.​[[75]](#Sheth-63F7CDD8) Regardless, care must be taken to use these medications at the lowest effective dose.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Rhinitis is common in pregnancy. Pregnant women are also more likely to complain of congestion, even in the absence of allergic rhinitis, i.e., rhinitis of pregnancy.​[[76]](#c0036n00365)​[[77]](#c0036n00366)​[[78]](#c0036n00367) As with all medications in pregnancy, it is ideal to discuss the relative risks and benefits with the patient. Unfortunately, there are very few clinical trials in pregnant and breastfeeding women with rhinitis.

### Management during Pregnancy

Preferred initial therapy for nasal symptoms during pregnancy is **saline nasal sprays** or **drops**.

All antihistamines are known to cross the placenta; however, ophthalmic​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146) and less-sedating antihistamines​[[25]](#c0036n00386)​[[80]](#c0036n00345) (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine)​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3) as well as chlorpheniramine​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146)​[[80]](#c0036n00345) are considered probably safe for use during pregnancy. Avoid use of **oral** decongestants during the first trimester of pregnancy due to conflicting reports of possible malformations with first-trimester use.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)​[[82]](#AseltonPJickHMilunskyAEtAl.First-tr-D6E08033)​[[83]](#WerlerMMMitchellAAShapiroS.FirstTri-D6E08207)​[[84]](#TorfsCPKatzEABatesonTFEtAl.Maternal-D6E085E1)​[[85]](#ZierlerSRothmanKJ.CongenitalHeartDi-D6E087BA)​[[86]](#KallenBAOlaussonOP.UseOfOralDeconge-D6E08976) Short-term intranasal decongestants may be used in pregnancy.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)

Intranasal corticosteroids are associated with minimal systemic effects in adults and are more effective than antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists for allergic rhinitis; risk-benefit considerations thus favour INCS as first-line therapy during pregnancy.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)​[[87]](#c0036n00422) From historical data and extrapolation from asthma studies, there is satisfactory evidence for safe use of beclomethasone​[[88]](#c0036n00342) and budesonide​[[89]](#c0036n00343) in pregnancy. Although there are limited studies involving other INCS (e.g., ciclesonide, fluticasone **propionate**, mometasone) in pregnancy, due to their low bioavailability, they are generally considered safe.​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146) A Quebec-based study reported an association between first-trimester use of intranasal triamcinolone and an increase in the risk of respiratory system defects, but the investigators could not rule out a chance finding.​[[90]](#BerardASheehyOKurzingerMEtAl.Intran-8F44F875)

Montelukast is generally considered safe in pregnancy;​[[25]](#c0036n00386) however, caution is advised as the majority of studies were done in animal models.​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146)

Due to a lack of safety data, immunotherapy should not be initiated during pregnancy; however, it may be continued (avoiding dose escalation) in those who were being treated prior to conception.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3)

Also due to a lack of safety data, **intranasal** ipratropium is typically recommended only when other therapies have failed; however, due to its low bioavailability, it is generally considered safe.​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3)

Sodium cromoglycate is considered safe for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in pregnancy;​[[25]](#c0036n00386)​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146)​[[91]](#c0036n00344) however, it is not currently available in Canada.

### Management during Breastfeeding

Preferred initial therapy for nasal symptoms during breastfeeding is **saline nasal sprays** or **drops**. Less-sedating antihistamines are generally considered safe in breastfeeding, especially cetirizine, loratadine, **intranasal** and **ophthalmic** products;​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3) however, reduction in milk supply is theoretically possible.​[[92]](#LactMed-1ADD8540) Pseudoephedrine is known to concentrate in breast milk;​[[92]](#LactMed-1ADD8540) although there are few reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant (e.g., irritability),​[[92]](#LactMed-1ADD8540) nasal decongestants are preferred over oral decongestants, as they have less systemic effects and exposure. The use of nasal decongestants should be limited to a maximum of 5 days per rhinitis episode.

Due to their low bioavailability, the use of intranasal corticosteroids, sodium cromoglycate and ipratropium in breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe.​[[79]](#BriggsGG-1ADD1146)​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3)​[[92]](#LactMed-1ADD8540) Montelukast is known to concentrate in breast milk; it is generally considered safe for the treatment of asthma during breastfeeding and is often used to treat asthma in very young children.​[[81]](#Schaefer-1EE248E3)​[[92]](#LactMed-1ADD8540)

There are no studies regarding the use of immunotherapy in breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Desloratadine, loratadine and rupatadine are available as syrups. Cetirizine is available as a chewable tablet, an oral solution and a fast-dissolve tablet. Loratadine tablets are tasteless and can be chewed; however, gelcaps should be swallowed whole.
- Intranasal corticosteroids will reduce nasal polyp size and reduce nasal congestion, but long-term treatment is generally required; one guideline recommends 3 months of therapy.​[[93]](#Fokkens-63F84445)
- Anosmia is not usually improved by INCS. If surgery is considered, the use of topical corticosteroids after surgery may decrease the recurrence rate.
- A short course (5–7 days) of **oral** corticosteroids may be used for very severe nasal symptoms.​[[25]](#c0036n00386)
- Patients with predictable seasonal allergic rhinitis can start medications such as INCS before the allergen exposure period and take them regularly until the end of the season for maximum effectiveness.
- If desired results are not achieved with once-daily dosing of INCS, a twice-daily regimen may be more effective, even at the same total daily dose.
- Antihistamines are not contraindicated in asthmatic patients and may have a slightly beneficial effect on asthma symptoms.
- Refer patient to an allergist or immunologist in the following clinical situations:​[[25]](#c0036n00386)

  - inadequate control of symptoms despite adherence and correct use of antihistamines and INCS
  - adverse reactions to multiple medications
  - reduced quality of life and/or ability to function secondary to the condition
  - desire to identify the sensitizing allergens and to receive advice on environmental control
  - comorbid conditions such as asthma and recurrent sinusitis; refer patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis if upper airway symptoms remain uncontrolled or if they are recurrent
  - assessment for allergen immunotherapy
