### Introduction

Patients with diabetes may develop neuropathy and associated loss of protective sensation. As a result, they may develop a foot ulcer or traumatic wound that may be complicated by a severe, limb- or life-threatening infection.​[[1]](#c0129n1001)​[[2]](#c0129n1002) Furthermore, impaired arterial blood supply from peripheral vascular disease in the patient with diabetes may impair healing of ulcers and infections. Treatment morbidity and sequelae, including foot deformity and amputation, may impair function and quality of life.​[[3]](#c0129n1003)​[[4]](#c0129n1004) Consensus guidelines may assist clinicians to evaluate and treat diabetic foot problems.​[[2]](#c0129n1002)​[[5]](#c0129n1005)​[[6]](#c0129n1006)​[[7]](#LipskyBA2Aragxf3n-Sxe1nchezJDiggleM-9D22F1C1)​[[8]](#Schaper-9D22F1C1)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent occurrence and recurrence
- Cure the acute or chronic infection
- Heal wounds (diabetic foot ulcers, traumatic wounds)
- Restore limb function for activities of daily living with appropriate footwear and orthoses

### Investigations

Patients with diabetes should have regular foot screening (see [Prevention of Diabetic Foot Infections](#c0129n00020) and [Figure 1](#c0129n00028)). In the case of a suspected diabetic foot infection, appropriate investigations include:​[[5]](#c0129n1005)​[[6]](#c0129n1006)

- Past history:

  - duration of diabetes
  - long-term glycemic control, e.g., hemoglobin A1c
  - complications of diabetes including ophthalmopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, vasculopathy
  - previous or current foot ulcers, infection, Charcot arthropathy, gangrene, trauma, amputations, surgery
  - smoking
- History:

  - known or perceived trauma (blunt or penetrating)
  - fever, chills, rigors
  - new or different pain in limb
  - swelling of limb
  - change in footwear
  - recent antimicrobial therapy
  - recent aggravation of glycemic control
  - presence and duration of a skin ulcer; any recent change such as new or increased drainage and odour
- Physical examination:

  - skin discoloration (red, pink, blue, white or black), lymphangitis
  - increased warmth or coldness
  - dependent rubor
  - swelling, joint stiffness
  - malodorous foot
  - corns, calluses
  - ulcer, skin crack or traumatic wound (location, size, depth, vascularity, drainage or pus; probe for palpable or exposed bone)

    Note: if bone is palpated at the base of a diabetic foot or ankle ulcer, osteomyelitis is present unless proven otherwise.
  - nail problems (ingrown toenail, onychomycosis)
  - web spaces between toes (cracks, maceration, ulcer, drainage)
  - deformity of toes, foot or ankle
  - pedal pulses, capillary refill and assessment of other pulses or evidence of arterial obstruction
  - neuropathy: assessed with the inability to perceive the 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament
  - footwear inspection (rough edges and seams; shoe size and fit; foreign body in the shoe or penetrating through the sole; blood stains, odour or pressure; wear pattern on sole)
- Radiographic investigations:

  - plain radiography of the foot and ankle may show soft tissue swelling, gas in soft tissues, vascular calcification and bony changes (lytic changes/erosions in bone, osteopenia, periosteal elevation, fracture or sequestrum) or may be normal in early stages; radiography is a simple, cost-effective technique for following response to treatment for osteomyelitis
- Other diagnostic imaging:​[[9]](#c0129n1007)

  - bone scintigraphy may be abnormal with bone infection, fracture or Charcot arthropathy, and may be difficult to interpret in the presence of overlying skin and soft tissue infection
  - gallium scintigraphy or indium-labelled white blood cell scan sometimes may distinguish between fracture and infection
  - MRI with or without gadolinium enhancement may show bony changes or abscess, but availability is frequently limited
  - ultrasonography may show abscess or non-radio-opaque foreign bodies
  - computed tomography may show bony changes or abscess
- Laboratory studies:

  - CBC with differential
  - blood cultures (if systemic involvement is suspected)
  - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (to follow course of treatment)
  - fasting blood glucose (aggravation of glycemic control may be a sign of sepsis)
  - electrolytes, renal and liver function tests (baseline toxicity parameters for antimicrobial therapy)
  - superficial swab for culture (with pathogen identification and antimicrobial sensitivities) of ulcer or traumatic wound (including drainage) frequently shows superficial contamination or colonization of the wound and may not correlate with deep wound or bone culture;​[[10]](#c0129n1008) superficial specimens are generally discouraged, and the results must be interpreted with caution
  - tissue (deep soft tissue and bone) biopsy and culture (with pathogen identification and antimicrobial sensitivities) provide a more accurate representation of the actual pathogens than superficial swab culture and are more useful in guiding antimicrobial therapy​[[10]](#c0129n1008)
  - aspiration of joint (if septic arthritis is suspected) and submission of the joint fluid specimen for cell count, crystal analysis and culture
- Vascular studies:

  - ankle-brachial index (ABI): ≤0.8 may indicate delayed wound healing potential; ≤0.5 may indicate inadequate arterial inflow and very poor chance of healing, and vascular consultation may be indicated to assess for vascular reconstruction or amputation
  - Doppler arterial waveforms
  - toe blood pressures (pressure ≤40 mm Hg may indicate poor healing potential)

[Table 1](#c0129n00010) summarizes the differential diagnosis of diabetic foot infection.

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Diabetic Foot Infection

| Differential Diagnosis | Characteristics | Most Likely Pathogen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infectious ​ [a] |
| Abscess | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance. MRI or ultrasonography may show a cavity. Pus may be aspirated from abscess cavity | Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA or MRSA) |
| Cellulitis | Erythema without raised borders, swelling, with or without fluctuance | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common) |
| Erysipelas | Erythema with raised borders, swelling, with or without fluctuance | Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) |
| Lymphangitis | Erythematous streaking following the distribution of the lymphatics, not raised | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common) |
| Macerated foot | Tissues are excessively moist and macerated from soaking the foot | Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be the predominant pathogen in conjunction with S. aureus and other Gram-positive microorganisms |
| Osteomyelitis | Palpation of bone at base of ulcer. Radiographic changes may be noted (periosteal elevation, bone destruction, sequestrum) but may be absent in the early stages | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is the most common pathogen, but other less virulent organisms may be pathogenic, e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci |
| Septic arthritis | Erythema, swelling, stiffness, fluctuance at joint, malalignment of foot distal to involved joint | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is the most common pathogen |
| Septic foot | Necrotic, foul-smelling foot with extensive areas of nonviable tissue. Gas may be seen in the soft tissues | Polymicrobial process involving Gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria |
| Suppurative tenosynovitis | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance along tendon; pain with tendon motion. MRI or ultrasonography may show fluid in tendon sheath. Pus may be aspirated from tendon sheath | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common), but may be polymicrobial including Gram-negative bacteria |
| Systemic sepsis | Fever, chills, rigors, shock, changes in mental status, impaired glycemic control, blood cultures that may yield bacteria | Any organism arising from a foot infection |
| Noninfectious |
| Noninfected ulcer | Open wound without signs of infection | N/A |
| Charcot arthropathy | Erythema, swelling, increased warmth; erythema may decrease with elevation of foot. Radiographic changes of fracture, dislocation or articular destruction may be noted several weeks after onset | N/A |
| Crystalline arthropathy | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance and tenderness of joint. Joint fluid analysis may show crystals consistent with pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate) or gout (uric acid) | N/A |
| Fracture, dislocation | Erythema and swelling may be present. Radiographic findings of fracture or dislocation | N/A |
| Ischemia, gangrene | Discoloration (pale, dusky or black), dependent rubor, coldness to touch, prolonged or absent capillary refill, absent peripheral pulses; decreased ankle-brachial index, toe blood pressures and tissue oxygen level | N/A |

[a] All infections may present with or without fever, chills, rigors, localized pain, swelling, erythema, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and aggravation of glycemic control.

### Therapeutic Choices

Optimal treatment of diabetic foot infections includes drainage and débridement, proper wound care to promote healing, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, surgery as indicated, and correction of metabolic irregularities (glucose control). Treatment choices are guided by the severity of infection.

*Note*: noninfected wounds *do not* need to be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics.​[[11]](#DumvilleJC-5FAE0531)

[Figure 2](#c0129n00029) outlines the recommended approach to a suspected diabetic foot infection.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Surgery

There are various situations when surgical interventions are appropriate:​[[1]](#c0129n1001)

- Incision and drainage of abscess with submission of purulent material for culture
- Irrigation and débridement of infected wounds with submission of purulent material for culture
- Amputation of gangrenous tissue (toes, forefoot), attempting to salvage remaining healthy foot for functional activities of daily living
- Amputation proximal to the foot: acute (rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection) or chronic (limb dysfunction from chronic infection or deformity)
- Further surgery to improve healing potential (ostectomy, wound coverage procedures, bony reconstruction, vascular reconstruction)

### Wound Care

Proper wound care is essential regardless of the presence of infection. Continue wound healing measures until the wound is healed even if infection is cleared. Débridement removes necrotic debris. Paring of calluses removes hyperkeratotic tissue, which could otherwise serve as an impediment to healing or, if excessive, could increase plantar pressure beneath the callus, and undermine and destroy the soft tissues.

There are many dressing choices; dressings that provide a moist environment for wound healing are the most desirable. Saline-moistened gauze or hydroactive gel dressings provide a moist wound healing environment and assist in débridement; however, there are limited data to support the use of any specific dressing,​[[12]](#c0129n01072)​[[13]](#c0129n01073)​[[14]](#c0129n01074)​[[15]](#c0129n01075) including those that are antimicrobial-based.​[[16]](#c0129n1009)​[[17]](#c0129n1010)​[[18]](#c0129n1011)​[[19]](#c0129n1012) If the wound is excessively moist and becoming macerated, a dressing such as a Hydrofiber or an alginate will absorb exudate; if the wound has necrotic debris at its base, a débriding dressing such as saline-moistened gauze may be beneficial. See Pressure Ulcers for a description of various dressings.

Pressure relief (offloading the wound) with orthoses (braces, removable walker boots or ankle/foot orthoses), crutches or casts may promote wound healing.​[[20]](#c0129n01078)

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Antimicrobial Therapy

There is a paucity of data to enable recommendation of one antimicrobial agent over another.​[[2]](#c0129n1002)​[[21]](#SelvaOlidASolxe0IBarajas-NavaLAEtAl-9D23AE37)

Factors contributing to the choice of antimicrobial agents include:

- Severity of infection
- Factors affecting sensitivity and resistance:

  - culture and susceptibility data: pending (empiric therapy; see [Table 2](#c0129n00021)) or available (culture-directed therapy)
  - local epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles
  - antibiotic use in the past month (if so, select regimen with broader coverage, e.g., to include Gram-negative bacilli if not already covered)
- Access and administration concerns:
  - bioavailability of oral antimicrobials
  - patient residence (ease of access to medical care for antimicrobial administration, toxicity screening and follow-up evaluation)
  - availability of home IV therapy program​[[22]](#c0129n1013)
  - frequency of dosing
  - drug interactions
  - cost and availability of agents
  - likelihood of adherence to treatment

Initial therapy is usually empiric and based on the severity of infection (see [Table 2](#c0129n00021)). Empiric therapy for early infections should target Staphylococcus aureus and the beta-hemolytic streptococci; however, use the local epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to guide decision-making about empiric therapy.​[[23]](#c0129n1014)

Patients who present with well-established infections, including necrotic tissue or foul-smelling discharge, should receive empiric therapy that also targets Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens, particularly if the patient has been soaking the foot.​[[2]](#c0129n1002) If necrotic tissue is present and/or deep infection such as an abscess is suspected or confirmed, arrange a surgical opinion because antimicrobial therapy alone is unlikely to resolve the situation.

Oral therapy is usually sufficient for patients with mild and localized infections.​[[24]](#c0129n1015) In patients with more extensive infections, which may be associated with systemic manifestations, IV therapy is indicated.

Duration of antimicrobial therapy is usually guided by response to therapy. For superficial and limited infections, a 7- to 14-day course of oral antimicrobial agents may be sufficient. If the infection is slow to improve or if it recurs, evaluate for other problems such as undrained abscess, foreign body, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.

Treatment of osteomyelitis is more complex because of bone involvement, and surgery is considered in the decision-making process. Potentially beneficial treatment options include either a prolonged course of oral therapy lasting months, guided by clinical, laboratory (ESR, CRP) and plain radiographic follow-up evaluation, or a 6-week course of parenteral therapy.​[[22]](#c0129n1013)​[[24]](#c0129n1015)​[[25]](#c0129n1016) Follow-up evaluation with clinical examination and radiography may indicate that the 6-week course of parenteral therapy is sufficient or that it should be extended or followed with a prolonged course of oral therapy. Regardless of the route of antimicrobial administration, if clinical improvement is not observed (resolution of erythema, edema, heat, draining sinus, coverage of bone with soft tissue) and there is persisting plain radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis without improvement, consult an infectious disease specialist and a surgeon knowledgeable in the treatment of the diabetic foot.

For additional information regarding acute osteomyelitis, see Acute Osteomyelitis.

**Table 2:** Empiric Therapy for Infection in the Diabetic Foot

| Infection Severity | Antimicrobial Agent​[a]​[b]​[c] |
| --- | --- |
| Localized infections: Neither limb- nor life-threatening Usually associated with cellulitis surrounding an ulcer Purulent debris may be present at the base of the ulcer Usual organisms: aerobic Gram-positive cocci ( Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci) Frequently treated with outpatient oral antimicrobial therapy | Oral Preferred Amoxicillin /​ clavulanate Cephalexin Clindamycin Cloxacillin ​ [d] Doxycycline Linezolid ​ [e] Sulfamethoxazole /​ trimethoprim |
| More extensive infections: Includes more severe infections, including more extensive cellulitis, plantar abscess and deep space infections The choice of oral vs. parenteral therapy should be guided by the extent of the infection and the patient’s overall clinical status Initial antimicrobial therapy directed against staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes and common Enterobacteriaceae species Empiric treatment targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa is generally unnecessary unless risk factors present, e.g., history of foot soaking, severe or chronic infection Patients who are not toxic may be treated with débridement and oral antimicrobial therapy Patients who are ill or toxic despite moderate local signs are treated as having a severe infection Characteristics and treatment of severe infection: Limb- or life-threatening Frequently polymicrobial MRSA is suspected or confirmed to be present Immediate hospitalization, early surgical débridement and parenteral antimicrobial therapy (until stable, followed by oral therapy) | Oral Options Amoxicillin /​ clavulanate Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus clindamycin or metronidazole Linezolid ​ [e] Moxifloxacin Sulfamethoxazole /​ trimethoprim plus clindamycin or metronidazole |
| Parenteral Options First- (e.g., cefazolin ), second- (e.g., cefoxitin , cefuroxime ) or third-generation (e.g., ceftazidime , ceftriaxone ) cephalosporin plus metronidazole Carbapenem Clindamycin plus third-generation cephalosporin Daptomycin Linezolid ​ [e] Piperacillin /​ tazobactam |
| Options for MRSA Linezolid ​ [e] Vancomycin |
| Osteomyelitis: Treat with IV therapy or long-term oral antimicrobial therapy using agents that are well absorbed from the GI tract and have good distribution to bone and tissue Surgical débridement indicated to remove necrotic debris, abscess or sequestrum Therapy should be based on culture results whenever possible If MRSA is present or suspected, consider addition of vancomycin or linezolid | Oral Options Amoxicillin /​ clavulanate Cephalexin Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus clindamycin or metronidazole Clindamycin Cloxacillin ​ [d] Doxycycline Linezolid ​ [e] Moxifloxacin Sulfamethoxazole /​ trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole /​ trimethoprim plus clindamycin or metronidazole |
| Parenteral Options Carbapenem Clindamycin PO/IV or metronidazole PO/IV plus third-generation cephalosporin Daptomycin Linezolid ​ [e] Piperacillin /​ tazobactam |
| Options for MRSA Linezolid ​ [e] Vancomycin |

[a] The agents suggested in this section are for empiric therapy prior to the availability of final culture and susceptibility results. Knowledge of local epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles must also guide therapeutic choices.

[b] Many of the agents identified in this table do not have Health Canada approval specifically for treatment of diabetic foot infections including osteomyelitis, but may have an indication for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections or antimicrobial activity against typical pathogens encountered in osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot.

[c] Duration of therapy is based on clinical response; however, typical treatment courses for skin and soft tissue infections range from 7 (mild) to 21 (severe) days, and the treatment of osteomyelitis may require 4–6 weeks of parenteral or several months of oral antimicrobial therapy. Whenever possible, it is desirable to switch to oral antimicrobial therapy to avoid complications from parenteral administration.

[d] Rarely used for this indication due to QID dosing, poor bioavailability, need for empty stomach administration.

[e] If linezolid is used for >2 weeks, monitor for myelosuppression (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia).

### Prevention of Diabetic Foot Infections

Prevention of diabetic foot infections involves systemic and local factors:

Systemic interventions include glucose control and treatment of medical comorbidities, including smoking cessation. Individuals who smoke should be encouraged to stop smoking (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). Correcting glucose control may help prevent progression of diabetic complications, aid the resolution of any existing infection and promote wound healing.​[[26]](#c0129n1017)

Local interventions include care of the feet and callus paring. Advise patients with diabetes who have peripheral neuropathy to inspect the feet and shoes daily, have a foot examination by a health-care provider at least 4 times per year, avoid walking barefoot and use appropriately fitted footwear with soft protective insoles.​[[27]](#c0129n1018) Before bathing, verify water temperature with a nonaffected limb. Advise patients to have regular nail care (cutting nails straight across) and avoid the application of heat or chemicals to the feet.

To prevent infection, promote healing of noninfected ulcers (see Nonpharmacologic Choices: [Wound Care](#c0129n00006)). An open ulcer on the foot of a person with diabetes does *not* require antimicrobial treatment unless the ulcer is clinically infected (erythema; edema; purulent discharge; new or intensified pain; systemic signs such as fever, chills, rigors or dysglycemia).​[[2]](#c0129n1002) In addition to contributing to the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance, the use of these agents for clinically noninfected wounds could lead to adverse outcomes such as allergic reactions, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridioides difficile–associated disease, taste perversion and painful peripheral neuropathy (associated with metronidazole).

Consult with a surgeon who has experience in foot and ankle surgery if corrective surgery for treatment of morphologic abnormalities is being considered.

Diabetic foot clinics may provide coordinated care for persons with diabetes and foot-related complications.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Examine an ulcer using an instrument such as forceps. If bone is palpated at the base of a diabetic foot or ankle ulcer, osteomyelitis is present unless proven otherwise.
- Foot baths are not recommended because they may lead to maceration of the skin.​[[5]](#c0129n1005)
- In the absence of a previous history of foot ulcer, open wound, or current systemic signs of infection, a red, warm, swollen foot may be a sign of early Charcot arthropathy.​[[28]](#c0129n1019)​[[29]](#c0129n1020)
- Biopsy or aspiration of joints in Charcot arthropathy could create risk of iatrogenic infection; if systemic signs of infection, such as fever, chills, rigors or poor glucose control, are absent, consider the risk versus benefit of invasive tests that could introduce infection.
