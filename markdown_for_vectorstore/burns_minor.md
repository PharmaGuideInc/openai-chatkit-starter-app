### Pathophysiology

Burns encompass a spectrum of tissue injury resulting in both local and systemic responses.​[[1]](#psc1174n1001)​[[2]](#JeschkeMGVanBaarMEChoudhryMAEtAl-754D8E31)​[[3]](#ZwierelloWPiorunKSkorka--754D9CB0) Excessive heat to the skin creates a local reaction at the contact point and spreads in 3 specific zones (Jackson’s Model):

- The *zone of coagulation* is the centre of the burn. It is where the most damage occurs and where tissue loss can be irreversible.
- Surrounding this is the *zone of ischemia or stasis*, which represents an area where circulation is decreased and where recovery can occur with proper treatment.
- The outermost area is the *zone of hyperemia,* where the least amount of damage occurs and where tissue should recover.​[[1]](#psc1174n1001)​[[2]](#JeschkeMGVanBaarMEChoudhryMAEtAl-754D8E31)​[[3]](#ZwierelloWPiorunKSkorka--754D9CB0)​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F)​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

Systemic reactions generally occur with severe burns and can include shock, muscle damage, and cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions (smoke inhalation).​[[2]](#JeschkeMGVanBaarMEChoudhryMAEtAl-754D8E31)​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

Burns can be caused by:​[[3]](#ZwierelloWPiorunKSkorka--754D9CB0)​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F)​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)​[[6]](#NielsonCBDuethmanNCHowardJMEtAl.-754DCA99)

- Heat, the most common cause (thermal burns), e.g., hot liquids, oils or grease (scalds), flame (fire), radiant heat or contact with a hot object, hot gases (e.g., steam), smoke inhalation
- Radiation, e.g., sun, ultraviolet (UV) lamps, lasers, radiation cancer treatments
- Electricity, e.g., lightning, arc flashes, direct electric current. Electrical burns may be deeper than they appear (most of the damage is below the surface injury) and is related to the voltage
- Chemical exposures that can either be acid based (battery acids, pool disinfectants, dyes, rust removers, metal cleaners, laboratory reagents) or alkali based (caustic cleaners, fertilizers, drain cleaners, cement, plaster) and where damage continues until the chemical is deactivated

The potential seriousness of a burn is related to:​[[2]](#JeschkeMGVanBaarMEChoudhryMAEtAl-754D8E31)​[[3]](#ZwierelloWPiorunKSkorka--754D9CB0)

- Body location and skin thickness
- Temperature of the causative agent
- Type of causative agent
- Duration of exposure to causative agent
- Extent of the burn
- Depth of the burn (particularly affects healing time and potential sequelae of scarring and contractures)
- Timing of burn treatment (delayed or immediate)

Patient factors that increase the risk of burn wound infections or delayed burn healing include:​[[1]](#psc1174n1001)

- Age (patients <5 or >60 years of age are presumed to have thinner skin and therefore greater risk)
- Underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or vascular disease
- Malnutrition (can delay healing)
- Smoking
- Stress
- Immunosuppression (including drugs that suppresses the immune system)

Characteristics of burn wounds are summarized in [Table 1](#psc1174n00006). (See photos: , , and ).

| OldNomenclature | Class | Examples | Appearance | Healing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First degree | Superficial (epidermis only) | Mild sunburn; scalds from liquids; low-intensity heat | Dry; pink/discoloured; blanches with pressure; initially painful; some edema; no blisters; skin remains intact so infection is not a concern | 3–7 days; no scarring |
| Second degree | Superficial partial thickness (epidermis, upper dermis) | Scald (spill, splash); brief contact with flame or hot object; more severe sunburn | Moist; weeping; red/discoloured; small blisters; blanches with pressure; extreme pain | 7–21 days; potential pigment changes; generally no long-term scarring |
|  | Deep partial thickness (epidermis, deep dermis with some hair follicle, sweat gland damage) | Scald; oil or grease; longer contact with flame or steam | Wet or waxy; dry; colour variable (red, patchy white); fluid filled blisters; no blanching with pressure; pain only with pressure | >21 days; risk of scarring and contracture (skin tightening) |
| Third degree | Full thickness (epidermis, dermis to subcutaneous layer) | Scald (immersion); super heated steam; flame; concentrated chemicals; high-voltage electrical | Dry; waxy white to leathery grey to charred and black; no blanching with pressure; painless (due to destruction of nerves) | Never heals spontaneously; requires surgery/grafts High risk of scarring; contractures (skin tightening); systemic and skin infection; fluid loss |

### Goals of Therapy

- Minimize further damage from suspected causative agent
- Promote healing and restoration of damaged tissue
- Prevent infection/complications
- Control pain

### Patient Assessment

The size of a burn is measured as a proportion of total body surface area (TBSA). The Wallace “rule of nines” is one calculation method used (see [Table 2](#psc1174n00007)). The patient’s palm and fingers are considered equal to about 1% of TBSA.​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F) A second method is the Lund and Browder chart that uses different percentage points for the different sections of the body.​[[2]](#JeschkeMGVanBaarMEChoudhryMAEtAl-754D8E31)​[[10]](#psc1174n01018) This may be a more accurate method for children; an example can be found in [Suggested Readings](#psc1174n00005).

Self-management is appropriate for most superficial burns or superficial partial-thickness burns that involve <15% of TBSA in adults <40 years of age or <10% TBSA in children or in adults >40 years of age. Burns to the hands, face, eyes, ears, perineum or genitalia are not appropriate for self-management (see below).​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

TBSA calculations performed for more severe burns (e.g., partial and full thickness) usually do *not* include the area of superficial burns.​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)​[[7]](#KumarRoshanEtAl.BurnInjury-754DD3C2)​[[9]](#psc1174n01019) In this case, patients should be referred for specialist care to minimize the risk of infection, fluid and electrolyte loss, and scarring. Specialist care is recommended in the following situations:​[[9]](#psc1174n01019)​[[10]](#psc1174n01018)

- Burns that involve >3% TBSA for adults or >2% TBSA for children.
- Burns of any size that are more serious than a superficial partial thickness burn with minimal blistering
- Burns involving thin skin areas (e.g., face, ears, eyelids, inner surface of arm, perineum, genitalia), even when blistering is minimal
- Burns in individuals presumed to have thin skin (e.g., children less than 5 years of age or adults older than 60)
- Burns involving the hands or feet or circumferential burns
- If there is concomitant trauma (e.g., electrical injury causing cardiac dysrhythmias)
- Electrical burns and chemical burns involving concentrated acid and alkali products, even if they appear to be minor, since the injury may be deeper than the initial appearance of the burn suggests and can progress to deep tissue necrosis within 24 hours
- Burns that have not healed after 2 weeks

Patients with even minor burns who have underlying conditions that put them at risk of infection or delayed healing, such as diabetes, social issues that increase the risk of treatment failure, or immunocompromised states (including drug-induced immunosuppression), may require close monitoring and follow-up.​[[9]](#psc1174n01019)

Assessment of burn patients is summarized in [Figure 1](#psc1174n00008).

| Both legs | 36 | 28 |
| Genitalia/perineum | 1 |  |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Thermal burns are treated by removal of the causative agent to minimize further tissue damage. Cooling should be started as soon as possible for small burns as it can limit the extent of injury, decrease inflammation and provide some pain relief.​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F)​[[9]](#psc1174n01019) The area can be cooled for up to 20 minutes with cool-to-touch tap water irrigations or application of cool tap water compresses.​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F)​[[9]](#psc1174n01019)

Chemical burns are treated by removing the causative agent and clothing that has become saturated with the chemical. Irrigate the burn area with copious amounts of lukewarm or cool water and transport the patient to the emergency room for further treatment.​[[3]](#ZwierelloWPiorunKSkorka--754D9CB0)​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

Electrical burns are treated by first removing the source of electricity if safely possible and then immediately transporting the person to the emergency room for further treatment, as these burns are often more serious than they appear.​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

Radiation burns are commonly caused by sun exposure and are treated in a similar manner to thermal burns (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage).

**First Aid for Minor Burns**

First aid treatment of burns is dependent on the type of burn and the causative agent. Superficial or superficial partial-thickness burns caused by thermal agents or the sun are generally self-treatable. See [Patient Assessment](#psc1174n00003) for information on which burns require immediate medical attention in an emergency care setting.

To apply first aid for superficial burns:​[[4]](#SchaeferTJTannanSC.ThermalBurns-754DB67F)​[[8]](#psc1174n1002)​[[9]](#psc1174n01019)

- Stop the process or cause of the burn by removing the causative agent, removing any clothing that has been exposed to the causative agent, or removing the patient from the source of the burn.
- Cool the thermal burn area by running cool tap water over the area for 20 minutes. Cooling the burn for several hours helps to reduce pain and inflammation and may reduce the severity of tissue damage.
- Ice application is not recommended because it can cause vasoconstriction that may worsen the injury and lead to frostbite.
- Remove jewellery or anything restrictive from the burned area quickly in case the area swells.
- Use tap water and mild soap to gently clean the area if needed and rinse after cleaning.
- Leave small blisters intact. If blisters break, the area should be gently cleaned by a trained health-care professional (decreases risk of infection and allows antimicrobials to be more effective).
- Cover the wound with a nonadherent gauze dressing to protect it from friction and contamination. For more information on long-term management and types of dressings, see Dressings.
- The use of antiseptics or disinfectants to clean burn wounds is not recommended because they may impair wound healing.​[[7]](#KumarRoshanEtAl.BurnInjury-754DD3C2)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Care Products: Anesthetics, Dermatitis and Dry Skin, First Aid.

### Antibacterial Agents

Topical antiseptics are not routinely recommended due to limited and poor quality evidence.​[[11]](#NormanGChristieJLiuZEtAl.Antiseptic-9B9FF2CB)​[[12]](#Barajas-NavaLALxf3pez-AlcaldeJRoqux-6706B5A2) Topical antibiotics are not recommended for routine use on burns unless infection is present. It is important to monitor the patient for signs of infection and to treat if needed.​[[13]](#ChippE.OutpatientAndMinorBurnTreatm-754DE5BA) Silver sulfadiazine (SSD), a broad spectrum topical antibiotic, has historically been used to prevent burn wound infections. However, systematic reviews suggest that the use of SSD on superficial or partial thickness burns may result in delayed wound or burn healing.​[[5]](#JeschkeMMcCallumCBaronDEtAl.BestPra-754DC483)

Oral antibiotics have not been found to be effective in preventing burn wound infections.​[[6]](#NielsonCBDuethmanNCHowardJMEtAl.-754DCA99)​[[12]](#Barajas-NavaLALxf3pez-AlcaldeJRoqux-6706B5A2)​[[14]](#HylandEJConnollySMFoxJAEtAl-754DEB40)

### Pain and Itch Control Agents

Usual doses of nonprescription analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) are often sufficient to control pain in minor burns. ASA should be avoided in superficial partial-thickness or deep partial-thickness burns because platelet inhibition poses a risk of bleeding in the presence of open wounds.​[[8]](#psc1174n1002) Deeper burns with open areas often require opioids for adequate pain management.​[[8]](#psc1174n1002)​[[12]](#Barajas-NavaLALxf3pez-AlcaldeJRoqux-6706B5A2) Virtual reality has been utilized during dressing changes to decrease pain and anxiety through distraction of the patient.​[[13]](#ChippE.OutpatientAndMinorBurnTreatm-754DE5BA)

Local anesthetics are a common ingredient in topical products marketed for the relief of minor pain and itching associated with superficial burns, although there is no evidence to substantiate their effectiveness. Lidocaine and benzocaine commonly cause contact dermatitis, while pramoxine has low sensitizing potential. There is a risk of systemic absorption if local anesthetics are applied to blistered or large areas of skin. Camphor, menthol and phenol are counterirritants thought to have a cooling effect on the burned area and may provide some relief from itching. However, there is no evidence available for the use of counterirritants in the treatment of minor burns.

Itching is common during the healing phase, particularly in partial thickness burns. **Moisturizing lotions** relieve itching by restoring barrier function and colloidal oatmeal baths may provide symptomatic relief of itch in less severe burns.​[[14]](#HylandEJConnollySMFoxJAEtAl-754DEB40) Systemic antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, cetirizine and loratadine may be helpful in some patients whose itching is more bothersome.​[[8]](#psc1174n1002)​[[15]](#ChungBYKimHBJungMJ-754DFB95) Some evidence indicates that gabapentin and pregabalin may be an option for patients with neuropathic pain and itch that has not responded to moisturizers and antihistamines.​[[15]](#ChungBYKimHBJungMJ-754DFB95)​[[16]](#ZachariahJREtAl.Post-burnPruritusAR-FE824075) Avoid the use of topical antihistamines in this situation since the risk of sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis increases with prolonged use. The area will also be more sensitive to sun and extremes of heat and cold for up to a year depending on the severity of the burn. High SPF (30 or greater) **sunscreens** should be used until the wound has healed completely, to prevent permanent hyperpigmentation from repeated injury due to sun radiation​[[14]](#HylandEJConnollySMFoxJAEtAl-754DEB40) (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage).

### Other Agents

Various types and formulations of topical honey (including processed and unprocessed) have been shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. A systematic review found that topical honey interventions resulted in faster healing of some burns when compared to some conventional treatments.​[[11]](#NormanGChristieJLiuZEtAl.Antiseptic-9B9FF2CB)​[[17]](#JullABCullumNDumvilleJCWestbyMJDesh-8723ACD7) Further studies are required as large, randomized trials are limited.

The evidence is inconclusive regarding whether aloe vera gel or dressings improve outcomes for acute or chronic wounds including burns.​[[11]](#NormanGChristieJLiuZEtAl.Antiseptic-9B9FF2CB) A systematic review indicated that aloe vera improved healing time in partial thickness burns (second degree burns) but more robust studies are needed to conclusively determine effectiveness.​[[18]](#psc1174n1008)

**Tetanus prophylaxis** is recommended for deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns if it has been more than 5 years since the last booster. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that tetanus prophylaxis also be implemented if it is uncertain when the patient’s last booster was given or if the patient has not received the full 3 doses of the primary immunization series.​[[19]](#psc1174n1013)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 3](#psc1174n00016) provides a monitoring plan for burn therapy.

**Table 3:** Monitoring of Therapy for Burns

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pain | Monitor pain level every 4–6 h for the first few days and then daily. Monitor the level of pain based on a scale of 0–10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain. Assess whether pain interferes with sleep or usual daily activities. | The patient’s worst pain score should be less than 5. Higher pain scores interfere with sleep, daily activities and mood. | Patients whose pain is not responding adequately to regular (Q4–6H) doses of nonprescription analgesics may require further assessment and/or treatment (burn may be more severe than initially assessed). Opioid analgesics may be required if burn is more severe. |
| Burn healing | Monitor daily for 2–3 days, then weekly until healing is complete (usually 2 wk). Maximal scar resolution may take longer: monitor every 4–6 wk. | Sunburn erythema should be markedly reduced by 48 h. Peeling is normal (use moisturizers to prevent drying and peeling of the skin). | Patients require further assessment and/or treatment if healing is not complete within 7 days or if there is a significant risk or signs of infection or scarring. |
| Itching | Monitor every 4–6 h for itching on a daily basis for 5–7 days. Consider oral antihistamines for itching not responding to supportive measures such as moisturizing lotions, cool compresses or bathing. | Itching does not interfere with sleep or normal daily activities. | If itching does not respond to oral antihistamines or appears to worsen despite treatment, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Infection (swelling; surrounding discoloration that is tender to touch; red or purple streaks from the wound; pus; fever; swollen or tender lumps in the groin or armpit) | Monitor daily for signs of infection (assess at each dressing change if appropriate). | No signs or symptoms of infection noted before healing is complete. Risk is low after this point. | If signs and symptoms of infection are observed at the burn site, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
