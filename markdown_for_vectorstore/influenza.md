### Introduction

Influenza is an acute viral illness of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza A or influenza B virus.​[[1]](#PHACFluHP-5A7478C3) Illness may be mild to severe and can be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Complications from influenza disease can include bacterial pneumonia, a worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions and cardiovascular (CV) complications.​[[2]](#c0092n00199) Influenza is also associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the first week following an acute infection.​[[3]](#KwongMI) A typical influenza season in Canada runs from mid-October to the end of April.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a term often used in public health influenza surveillance programs that refers to any acute illness having symptoms typical of influenza. ILI is defined as an acute onset of respiratory illness with fever, cough and 1 or more of: sore throat, headache, anorexia, arthralgia, myalgia or extreme exhaustion/weakness. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be present in children <5 years of age. Fever may not be prominent in children <5 years of age or adults ≥65 years of age.​[[1]](#PHACFluHP-5A7478C3)

The clinical overlap of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections and other respiratory viruses (e.g., adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus) that may cause similar symptoms adds complexity to the recognition and diagnosis of influenza for both surveillance and clinical purposes.

### Investigations

- History with particular attention to symptoms and their onset is the key to appropriate testing and use of antiviral agents in managing influenza and COVID-19 (see COVID-19). Co-infection with influenza (type A or B) and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, and these, along with other respiratory viruses (e.g., adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, RSV, other coronaviruses), can present with a range of overlapping symptoms from asymptomatic to severe, including:
  - fever
  - cough
  - shortness of breath
  - fatigue
  - sore throat
  - rhinitis
  - arthralgias/myalgias
  - headache
- When influenza is known to be circulating in the community or in an area of recent travel, the following symptoms indicate a high likelihood of influenza infection (note: some symptoms may also be associated with COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses):
  - Among healthy adolescents and young adults not requiring hospitalization, abrupt onset of fever ≥38.5°C and dry cough is likely to be influenza.​[[4]](#c0092n00034)​[[5]](#c0092n00036) These symptoms are less predictive in persons with multiple chronic conditions, older adults and young children.
  - Young children can present with either a nonspecific febrile illness or with a respiratory illness resembling croup, bronchitis and occasionally bronchiolitis;​[[6]](#c0092n00035) GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may also be present in children <5 years of age.
  - Older adults: ≥1 symptoms of cough, fever, shortness of breath, sore throat. Atypical presentations are more common in those ≥65 years of age, e.g., extreme exhaustion/weakness, afebrile.​[[6]](#c0092n00035)​[[7]](#c0092n00106)
- Laboratory testing for influenza:

  - Beyond formal surveillance programs, widespread laboratory testing in the community is not necessary or practical, but it is important to differentiate between influenza and other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2) in the event of an outbreak of ILI in the long-term care setting or other institutional settings, including schools.
  - As a general guideline, nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic long-term care residents should be sent for laboratory testing in the event of ≥2 cases of ILI within a 72-hour period;​[[8]](#c0092n00037) obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from the initial cases as well as the next 3–5 individuals presenting with ILI. If nasopharyngeal swab is not possible, a combined throat and nares swab may be a suitable alternative. Note that protocols may differ by jurisdiction; providers should contact their local public health unit for regional specific guidance.
  - If not already arranged as part of pre-influenza season preparation, contact the laboratory to obtain instructions on specimen collection, storage and transport.
  - Based on recommendations from the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network, collect specimens within 5 days of onset of symptoms but preferably within 48 hours; sampling beyond 5 days may be considered in patients with persisting or worsening symptoms regardless of age, in young children or older adults, and in those who are immunocompromised.​[[9]](#c0092n00186)
  - False negative results with nasopharyngeal swabs can occur in patients with progressive disease. In these cases, lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected.
  - Hospitalized patients should receive the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (e.g., PCR), the most sensitive method to detect respiratory pathogens. The breadth and number of pathogens targeted will depend on local testing methods and resources; at minimum, these patients should get a panel that detects influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Multiplex panels to detect multiple pathogens can be considered in those with severe infections (e.g., ICU) or immunocompromising conditions.​[[10]](#c0092n00157)
  - Gargle tests have not been validated for influenza.
- Wastewater-based surveillance for respiratory viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV is tracked through the Government of Canada’s [wastewater monitoring dashboard](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/wastewater/). It can offer an early indication of infection rates within the community and provides a visual trend for each disease throughout the viral infection season.

### Prevention

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent influenza illness from occurring, especially in individuals at high risk of developing serious influenza-related complications, e.g., pneumonia, exacerbation of cardiac or respiratory disease, hospitalization, death
- Decrease influenza-related symptoms
- Prevent complications, e.g., CV events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in high-risk individuals
- Encourage appropriate use of antiviral agents
- Promote antimicrobial stewardship by reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for viral upper respiratory tract infections

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Adults with influenza can spread the disease 1 day prior to symptom onset and remain contagious for approximately 5 days following presentation of symptoms.​[[2]](#c0092n00199) Children and immunocompromised individuals may be contagious for a longer period.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

General measures to prevent the spread of influenza include the following:

- Wash hands often; use hand sanitizer if water and soap are not available
- Cough/sneeze into tissues (or into a sleeve if tissues are not available) and throw all used tissues into the garbage
- Use nonmedical or medical masks (as defined by the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/types-masks.html)), which can be worn by anyone at any time, but especially when sick, when outside the home (especially in crowded, indoor public places) and for those who are at high risk for complications from respiratory infections
- If flu symptoms are present, stay home from work or school and do not visit hospitals, nursing homes or individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications

In the event of a cluster of ILI in a nursing home or other long-term care setting, consult institution’s infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol or consult local public health unit then implement the following measures to reduce the potential of influenza spreading from symptomatic to well residents (see [Figure 1](#c0092n00011)):

- Promote and enhance proper handwashing by staff, ambulatory residents and visitors
- Utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), e.g., gloves, gowns, medical masks, N95 or equivalent respirators, eye protection​[[11]](#IPAC)
- Implement droplet precautions for symptomatic residents
- Confine symptomatic residents to their rooms until their acute symptoms have resolved
- Enhance environmental controls, e.g., more frequent cleaning
- If possible, symptomatic residents should be cared for only by staff who have received their annual influenza immunization
- If possible, symptomatic residents should be cared for by separate staff members who are not looking after well residents; if not possible, provide care for well individuals first, with strict handwashing between each patient
- Limit gatherings or activities where residents from different areas of the facility come into contact with each other
- Limit visitors when possible and exclude visits from all individuals with ILI
- Staff with symptoms of ILI should not work until their acute symptoms have resolved

### Pharmacologic Choices

See [Table 2](#c0092n00018) for a list of drugs and vaccines used in the prevention of influenza.

### Influenza Vaccine

October to mid-November is the usual recommended time for influenza immunization in the Northern hemisphere. Annual influenza vaccination of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications (see [Table 1](#c0092n00013)) remains the primary strategy for the reduction of influenza-related morbidity and mortality in both community and long-term care settings. In addition, annual vaccination of individuals who have significant contact with individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications (see [Table 1](#c0092n00013)) or who provide essential community services is recommended.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

Significant illness and societal costs also occur with seasonal influenza in people who may not be considered at high risk of complications (healthy people 5–64 years of age). Therefore, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends annual influenza vaccination for all individuals ≥6 months of age without contraindications.​[[2]](#c0092n00199) See [Table 2](#c0092n00018) for a description of available influenza vaccines in Canada; the exact type of influenza vaccines available through publicly funded immunization programs may vary among provincial/territorial jurisdictions.

**Table 1:** Recommended Recipients of Seasonal Influenza Immunization​​[[a]](#afn5306)[[2]](#c0092n00199)

| People at high risk for influenza-related complications: Adults and children with the following chronic health conditions: cardiac or respiratory disorders (including asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis) diabetes mellitus or other metabolic disorder cancer or immune-compromising conditions (due to underlying disease and/or therapy) renal disease anemia or hemoglobinopathy neurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions (children: seizure disorders, febrile seizures and isolated developmental delay; adults: neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions and seizure disorders, excluding migraines and neuropsychiatric conditions without neurologic conditions) morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m​ 2 ) children and adolescents (6 months – 18 y ) requiring chronic ASA therapy Residents (of any age) of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities All individuals ≥65 y of age All children 6–59 months of age All pregnant individuals (all trimesters) Indigenous peoples​ [b] |
| People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications: Health-care workers and other care providers in all practice settings, e.g., volunteers, housekeeping staff Household contacts (adults and children) of high-risk individuals, including: high-risk groups mentioned above infants <6 months members of a household expecting a newborn during influenza season People who provide regular child care to children 0–59 months of age, whether in or out of the home People who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to individuals at high risk, e.g., crew on a ship |
| Other: People who provide essential community services, e.g., first responders People who are in direct contact with avian influenza–infected poultry during culling operations |

[a] Healthy individuals 5–64 years of age without contraindication are also encouraged to receive influenza vaccine even if they are not in one of the recommended recipient groups.

[b] Indigenous populations in Canada are more vulnerable to influenza due to social inequities, such as poorer housing conditions, inadequate access to health care and remote or isolated living locations. The National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health acknowledges that addressing these inequities is key to reducing the risk of influenza infection and severe outcomes for members of Indigenous communities.​[[12]](#NCCAH)

Many Canadian residents travel broadly and may visit areas with high influenza transmission. Influenza occurs all year round in the tropics, e.g., Asia, Caribbean region, and peaks during the winter season, i.e., April–October in the Southern hemisphere. Cruise ships also present high-risk exposure to influenza. NACI encourages influenza immunization for all Canadian travellers ≥6 months of age at risk of influenza exposure (see [Table 1](#c0092n00013)).​[[2]](#c0092n00199) Travellers are advised to review their vaccination status with their health-care practitioner prior to departure to ensure they have received an influenza vaccine available in Canada that will minimize their risk of influenza-related complications.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

Previous NACI statements recommended the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) preferentially for children 2–17 years of age based on earlier placebo-controlled trials and postmarketing surveillance that demonstrated superior vaccine efficacy compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.​[[2]](#c0092n00199) However, this recommendation is no longer supported, since data across several jurisdictions indicate that LAIV appears to confer protection similar to injectable influenza vaccines.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

The LAIV may offer advantages in terms of acceptability due to its needle-free nasal spray formulation for children 2–17 years of age. In addition to potential for broader mucosal immunity, which is theoretically beneficial, recent FDA approval (in September 2024) for self or caregiver administration of LAIV may further support its use by enhancing convenience and accessibility in certain settings.​[[13]](#FDAFluMist) Currently NACI does not express a preference between LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) for this age group. LAIV is not recommended in those with the chronic health conditions listed in [Table 1](#c0092n00013) or in patients with severe asthma, active wheeze, immunocompromising conditions, long-term ASA use, or in those who are pregnant.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

Quadrivalent IIVs (IIV4) contain strains related to both lineages of influenza B (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata), providing broader protection against influenza B. Canadian surveillance data indicate that the B/Yamagata lineage has not been detected since March 2020; NACI supports transitioning from IIV4 to trivalent IIVs (IIV3),​[[2]](#c0092n00199) which aligns with global recommendations. Currently, the recommendation is that any age-appropriate IIV4 or IIV3 may be used for individuals ≥6 months of age who do not have contraindications to the vaccine.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

###### Preferential Vaccination Options for Older Adults (≥65 Years of Age)

Age-related immunosenescence, where older individuals are unable to mount a protective immunogenic response to standard-dose vaccines, is one of the challenges in protecting this group against influenza. In a recent review by NACI, it was concluded that the evidence supports high-dose IIV (IIV-HD), adjuvanted IIV (IIV-Adj) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) having increased benefit as compared to standard-dose IIV (IIV-SD), with no difference in safety. IIV-HD, IIV-Adj and RIV4 were associated with a lower number of lab-confirmed influenza cases and influenza-associated hospitalization events compared to IIV-SD.​[[14]](#NACI-OlderAdults) Therefore, if available, IIV-HD, IIV-Adj or RIV4 should be preferentially offered to adults ≥65 years of age. If a preferred product is not available, any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines may be used.​[[14]](#NACI-OlderAdults)

###### Protective Effect of Influenza Vaccination on CV Events

Influenza vaccination may offer protective benefits against CV events such as heart attack, heart failure and stroke, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.  A 2012–2024 literature review conducted by NACI provided supporting evidence for a protective effect of influenza vaccination against CV events in high-risk populations, highlighting the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination within these groups.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

###### Influenza Vaccination in Egg-Allergic Individuals

With clinical evidence demonstrating safe administration of influenza vaccine in individuals with egg allergies,​[[16]](#GreenhawtMJSpergelJMRankMAEtAl.Safe-B6EECCB9)​[[17]](#DesRochesAParadisLGagnonREtAl.Egg-a-B6EEAF26)​[[18]](#ChungEYHuangLSchneiderL.SafetyOfInf-B6EE9063)​[[19]](#TurnerPJSouthernJAndrewsNJEtAl.Safe-CF2DBB9F) NACI recommendations have evolved. Egg-allergic adults and children may be vaccinated against influenza using any available influenza vaccine (see [Table 2](#c0092n00018)) without a prior influenza skin test, irrespective of the immunization setting or a past severe reaction to egg.​[[2]](#c0092n00199) As with all vaccines, immunization providers should be prepared for, and have the necessary equipment to respond to, vaccine emergencies at all times.

###### Coadministration with Other Vaccines

NACI supports the coadministration of seasonal influenza vaccines with other routine vaccines, including SARS-CoV-2, pneumococcal, RSV and shingles. This recommendation applies to all age groups for whom the vaccines are indicated, and there have been no identified safety concerns or reduction in immune response when influenza vaccines are administered at the same time as other vaccines. It is recommended when feasible to administer multiple vaccines at different anatomical sites (e.g., different arms) using separate needles and syringes.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

###### Influenza Vaccine and Oculorespiratory Syndrome

Oculorespiratory Syndrome (ORS) was initially identified during the 2000–2001 influenza season and has been observed, though rarely, in subsequent seasons. It is characterized by the presence of bilateral red eyes plus 1 or more respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, sore throat), with or without facial swelling, that occur within 24 hours of receiving influenza vaccination and resolves within 48 hours of symptom onset. ORS is not considered an allergic reaction and is not a contraindication to vaccination. Individuals who have experienced ORS without mild to moderate lower respiratory symptoms can safely receive influenza vaccine in subsequent seasons. Those who have had ORS with lower respiratory symptoms should be assessed by an expert prior to subsequent vaccination.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

###### Influenza Vaccine and Guillain-Barré Syndrome

Data suggest that the absolute risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following influenza illness exceeds the risk observed following influenza vaccination (approximately 17 excess cases vs. 1 excess case per million vaccines administered).​[[2]](#c0092n00199) Although there is presently insufficient evidence to either confirm or refute a causal association between seasonal influenza vaccine and GBS, it is recommended that subsequent influenza vaccination should be avoided in adults who experienced GBS without other known etiology within 6 weeks of receiving an influenza vaccine.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)

###### Antimicrobial Stewardship

In an Ontario-based study with data starting in 2000, a universal influenza vaccination (UIV) program (where influenza vaccines were publicly funded and offered to all individuals ≥6 months of age) was shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs. Researchers observed a significant decline in antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs compared to provinces without similar programs, suggesting a population-level impact on antimicrobial stewardship. This supports influenza vaccination as a strategy to mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use and reduce antibiotic resistance.​[[15]](#KwongUIVProgram)

### Antiviral Agents

Chemoprophylaxis with antiviral agents is most useful in the long-term care setting (see [Figure 1](#c0092n00011)).​[[10]](#c0092n00157)​[[20]](#GorisekMiksicNUrsicTSimonovicZEtAl.-A3D964EB)​[[21]](#VanDenDoolCHakEBontenMJEtAl.AModel--A3DA6080) When an influenza outbreak is identified in a long-term care setting, antiviral prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible to all residents who are not yet ill, regardless of their vaccination status, as well as to nonimmunized health-care providers.

Oseltamivir is the first-line agent during outbreaks of influenza A (if expected to be sensitive) or influenza B. When using the treatment alternative zanamivir as chemoprophylaxis, clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of bronchospasm in individuals with pre-existing severe respiratory disease and the potential difficulty experienced by some frail older patients in using the inhaler device. Zanamivir should not be reconstituted nor administered via nebulizer.

Monitoring of antiviral resistance of circulating influenza viruses has been incorporated into national surveillance programs, e.g., FluWatch. Amantadine has exhibited high levels of resistance and is therefore no longer recommended for prophylaxis.​[[10]](#c0092n00157) Some resistance has been documented against the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, but is reported at <1%.​[[22]](#FluWatch_AnnualReport)

In a long-term care setting, continue surveillance for new cases of ILI to establish effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in controlling an influenza outbreak once postexposure prophylaxis is initiated in a facility. Regardless of the agent used, identification of drug-resistant strains of influenza A during outbreak situations demands a change in therapy.

If cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza continue to occur more than 96 hours after initiation of antiviral prophylaxis, consider antiviral prophylaxis failure.​[[23]](#c0092n00043) Contact the local public health unit for guidance.

### Treatment

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve influenza symptoms
- Reduce duration of influenza infection
- Reduce influenza-related complications
- Decrease influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths
- Offer chemoprophylaxis for high-risk contacts

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Analgesics/Antipyretic Agents

Use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for relief of fever, headache and myalgias. To avoid overdose, caution patients about the concurrent use of cough and cold products that contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Cough and cold products contain other ingredients such as antihistamines, which may not be needed.

Children and adolescents should *not* take ASA due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome (see Fever).

### Antiviral Agents

The use of antiviral agents for treatment of influenza in healthy children and adults is not recommended;​[[24]](#c0092n00202)​[[25]](#c0092n00201) however, they should be considered for treatment in individuals 1–64 years of age who have a chronic condition or are immunocompromised. They should also be considered in those ≥65 years of age when influenza is either laboratory confirmed or strongly suspected based on symptoms and known local circulation. The use of antiviral agents for treatment of influenza in the community setting is illustrated in [Figure 2](#c0092n00012).

The usual duration of influenza symptoms is 4–7 days. Studies in otherwise healthy adults and children demonstrated that neuraminidase inhibitors reduce the duration of symptoms by about 0.5–1 day.​[[24]](#c0092n00202)​[[25]](#c0092n00201) Although controversial, early treatment with oseltamivir (within 12 h) may reduce influenza-related complications (need for antibiotics, hospitalizations, asthma exacerbations) in children ≤2 years of age​[[10]](#c0092n00157) as well as in adults and children >2 years of age at high-risk of complications.​[[24]](#c0092n00202)​[[25]](#c0092n00201)​[[26]](#Venkatesan-715BA218)​[[27]](#c0092n00155)​[[28]](#c0092n00156)​[[29]](#c0092n00053)​[[30]](#c0092n00107)​[[31]](#c0092n00046)​[[32]](#DobsonJWhitleyRJPocockSEtAl.Oseltam-A3DC264C)​[[33]](#c0092n00203)

Treatment with any antiviral agent is best initiated within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.​[[10]](#c0092n00157) However, initiation of treatment should be considered beyond 48 hours in the following circumstances: the illness is serious enough to require hospitalization; the illness is progressive, severe or complicated, regardless of previous health status; or the individual belongs to a group at high risk for influenza-related complications (see [Table 1](#c0092n00013)).​[[10]](#c0092n00157)​[[33]](#c0092n00203)

In the community and long-term care setting, the duration of treatment for both children and adults is 5 days.​[[10]](#c0092n00157) This is an adequate treatment period and it minimizes the risk of resistance.

Two new antivirals (baloxavir and peramivir) have been approved for use by Health Canada but are not yet available in Canada. Both agents have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of uncomplicated influenza by approximately 1 day when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.​[[34]](#balaxavir)​[[35]](#peramivir)

. . . . .

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Influenza and Pregnancy

Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of influenza-related complications not only in those with comorbidities but also in healthy pregnant individuals.​[[36]](#c0092n00162)​[[37]](#c0092n00163)​[[38]](#c0092n00164) The risk appears to be the greatest during the third trimester.​[[38]](#c0092n00164)​[[39]](#c0092n00165)​[[40]](#c0092n00166) Immunization of the pregnant individual appears to extend protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza to infants following birth and up to 6 months of age,​[[41]](#c0092n00167)​[[42]](#Fell-715E4DB4)​[[43]](#c0092n00207) possibly via maternal-infant transfer of antibodies.​[[44]](#c0092n00168) There is also evidence suggesting that infants born to vaccinated individuals during influenza season are less likely to be premature or small for gestational age, or to have low birth weight.​[[45]](#c0092n00208)​[[46]](#c0092n00209)​[[47]](#c0092n00210)​[[48]](#c0092n00211)

### Management

Prevention is the best strategy to reduce maternal morbidity associated with seasonal influenza. Immunization with seasonal inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine appears to be both safe and effective in all stages of pregnancy.​[[2]](#c0092n00199)​[[51]](#NACI-Preg) Until safety data are available, do not use the LAIV vaccines in those who are pregnant; however, they may be used in those who are breastfeeding.​[[51]](#NACI-Preg)

Acetaminophen may be used to treat fever and pain associated with influenza infection.​[[52]](#ACOG_influenza) In 2025, Health Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) reiterated that acetaminophen is the recommended treatment for pain or fever during pregnancy when used as directed at the lowest effective dose at the shortest duration needed, with no conclusive evidence linking it to autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.​[[49]](#HC_AcetNDD)​[[50]](#SOGC_AcetNDD) NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to a potential reduction in amniotic fluid​[[53]](#NSAIDrisk) and the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus if used in the third trimester.​[[54]](#PrematureClosure)

Both oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to be safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding based on preclinical and observational reports.​[[55]](#c0092n00171)​[[56]](#c0092n00172)​[[57]](#c0092n00173) Oseltamivir is recommended over zanamivir, as more safety data are available and its systemic absorption is expected to result in more consistent delivery to virus-infected respiratory tissues, especially in the later stages of pregnancy when distribution of inhaled zanamivir may be affected by the gravid uterus.​[[57]](#c0092n00173) As such, early treatment with oseltamivir is recommended for those who are pregnant.​[[10]](#c0092n00157) There is no evidence to support the use of baloxavir or peramivir in pregnancy or breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Antivirals are not substitutes for the influenza vaccine for prevention of influenza.
- Influenza surveillance information can be obtained from the [FluWatch program](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/influenza-surveillance.html) from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Contact local public health authorities to determine whether influenza is circulating in a specific community and, if so, whether it is influenza A or B.
- The influenza vaccine may be administered concurrently with any other vaccine (inactive or live).​[[2]](#c0092n00199)
- Having a low threshold for testing in long-term care residents with suspected respiratory viral infection will ensure rapid identification of influenza; this will lead to timely implementation of control measures, thereby reducing influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, each facility should have a surveillance program in place to identify ILI, policies and procedures regarding laboratory testing for symptomatic residents, and a respiratory illness outbreak response plan. Staff should be familiar with the case definition of ILI.
