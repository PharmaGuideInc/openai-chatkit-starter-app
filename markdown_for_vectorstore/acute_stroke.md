### Introduction

Stroke, recognized clinically as the sudden onset of a focal disturbance of central nervous system function, is caused by cerebral infarction (ischemic stroke, responsible for about 85% of all strokes) or intracerebral hemorrhage.​[[1]](#c0024n00028) Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common type of hemorrhage, more often causes sudden onset of severe headache with or without impaired consciousness and/or focal findings on neurological examination.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those caused by an ischemic stroke, and not resulting in lasting deficits. TIAs are clinically very important, as they can indicate the risk of future stroke in up to one-third of people. TIAs should be viewed as an opportunity to prevent future strokes and must be treated as an emergency.

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada promotes awareness of the [warning signs of possible stroke](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/signs-of-stroke) (see [Table 1](#table-1833-85F5BABE)) to encourage prompt response when needed.

**Table 1:** Warning Signs of Stroke

| F.A.S.T. |  |
| F ace—Is it drooping? | S peech—Is it slurred or jumbled? |
| A rms—Can you raise both? | T ime—Time to call 911 right away |

### Goals of Therapy

- Minimize brain damage
- Prevent complications resulting from stroke-related deficits, e.g., pneumonia, venous thromboembolism
- Reduce risk of stroke recurrence
- Restore function and minimize long-term disability for the individual

### Investigations

The evaluation of patients with suspected stroke is highly time-dependent. Specific stroke treatments (recanalization with thrombolytic drugs and/or endovascular thrombectomy) can be provided only within the first hours of symptom onset in most patients with ischemic strokes (see [Figure 1](#c0024n00006), [Figure 2](#ManagementOfThePatientWithANon-isch-B994A3DD)).

Use the clinical history, physical examination, imaging studies and other ancillary investigations to help confirm the diagnosis and exclude stroke mimics such as subdural hematoma, Todd paralysis (post-seizure), brain abscess, herpes simplex encephalitis, hypoglycemia, brain tumor (primary or secondary), multiple sclerosis, migraine and conversion disorder.​[[2]](#c0024n00038)

- History:

  - time last seen well, time of onset, if symptoms noted upon wakening from sleep
  - symptoms at onset, neurologic worsening or improvement since onset
  - medications (particularly time of last dose of any anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs as well as drugs that might hint at other relevant conditions—anticonvulsants, diabetes medications, chemotherapy drugs, steroids)
  - antecedent trauma, illness or previous neurovascular events
  - vascular comorbidity (angina, MI, heart failure, peripheral and renal vascular disease) or atrial fibrillation
  - vascular disease risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, excessive alcohol intake, high body mass index, low exercise, migraine with aura, obstructive sleep apnea, family history of vascular disease or hemostatic disorders)
  - pre-stroke cognitive and functional status
  - place of residence, occupation and social supports
- Physical examination:

  - rapid evaluation of airway, breathing and circulation; vitals including blood pressure should be obtained
  - localize lesion and determine stroke severity by using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
  - assess comorbid conditions and determine possible cause of stroke
- Emergency laboratory and radiological tests:

  - CBC, INR, PTT, glucose (to rule out hypoglycemia as a stroke mimic), electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, albumin and TSH
  - immediate neurovascular imaging to confirm the clinical diagnosis and plan treatment; urgent noncontrast CT head and CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck is the preferred imaging modality in the hyperacute phase of stroke:

    - noncontrast CT head can demonstrate changes associated with ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes or stroke mimics, such as tumors
    - CTA head can show intracranial occlusions or stenosis; multiphase CTA head can provide information about the state of collateral circulation in the brain at time of the stroke and assist in acute management
    - CTA neck may demonstrate occlusion or stenosis of carotid, vertebral or basilar arteries, or may indicate presence of a vascular dissection or other abnormalities such as fibromuscular dysplasia; patients with carotid stenosis may be amenable to revascularization therapy if they have had a TIA or non-disabling stroke
    - CT perfusion is sometimes used; it can improve the diagnostic yield of small ischemic strokes, rule out mimics and help with treatment decisions
    - MRI brain is occasionally used for extended-window thrombolysis decisions; however, emergency access to MRI in Canada is limited
    - carotid dopplers remain a useful screening tool for carotid stenosis if CTA not available
  - ECG (to look for atrial fibrillation, MI and left ventricular hypertrophy)
- Other investigations if indicated:

  - chest x-ray (to look for heart disease, lung cancer)
  - prolonged ECG monitoring (minimum 24 h Holter monitor, but 2 wk recommended)​[[3]](#SaposnikGLebovicGDemchukAEtAlOnBeha-A479DF1A) and echocardiography (transthoracic [with bubble study in patients <60] ± transesophageal) to search for a cardiac source of emboli in patients with embolic strokes
  - brain MRI (+diffusion weighted imaging) if cause of stroke is uncertain, particularly in young patients
  - antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation if arterial hypercoagulable state suspected; protein C, protein S, antithrombin III could be added if venous embolism is suspected in the case of a younger person with a confirmed patent foramen ovale on echocardiography
  - inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, antinuclear antibody [ANA]) as a screen for vasculitis
  - blood cultures and urgent echocardiogram if infectious endocarditis suspected
  - MRA with vessel wall imaging +/- catheter cerebral angiography if vasculitis or vascular anomaly suspected
  - lumbar puncture if suspected vasculitis, syphilis or other CNS infection
  - if CT is negative for blood but subarachnoid hemorrhage is still suspected, lumbar puncture is indicated
  - malignancy workup (CT chest, abdomen, pelvis)
  - syphilis and HIV serology

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke

Patients who have had major anterior circulation ischemic strokes with specific features (see [Table 2](#117-E85FE248)) stand to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).​[[4]](#RodriguesFBNevesJBCaldeiraDEtAl.End-163A8460) EVT is a nonsurgical, angiographic procedure that uses microcatheters to remove blood clots and re-establish arterial blood flow in the brain. [Figure 1](#c0024n00006) and [Table 2](#117-E85FE248) suggest a strategy to balance the potential benefit of EVT against persisting uncertainties and resource considerations. The time window for intervention is evolving, as we understand more about tissue-window in stroke care. Studies have shown that select patients identified using specialized imaging modalities (including automated calculation of infarct core as well as viable brain tissue represented by the ischemic penumbra) can benefit from EVT up to 24 hours after stroke onset.​[[5]](#CampbellBCVMaHRinglebPAEtAl.Extendi-9F83AF3B)​[[6]](#AlbersGWMarksMPKempSEtAl.Thrombecto-163A8A49)​[[7]](#NogueiraRGJadhavAPHaussenDC.Thrombe-163A86CE) Patients with stroke caused by basilar artery occlusion have been less well studied, but should also be considered for EVT.​[[8]](#LiuXXuGLiuYEtAl.AcuteBasilarArteryO-163A8C8D)​[[9]](#LiuXDaiQYeREtAl.EndovascularTreatme-9F8449A3)

EVT is best achieved by a clinician experienced in the procedure using a stent retriever and/or contact aspiration device.​[[10]](#LapergueBBlancRCostalatVEtAl.Effect-9F848766) EVT may be performed after initiating treatment with intravenous alteplase (rtPA) or in patients who would be excluded from alteplase use (see [Table 3](#table-11132232-85FC017C)).

**Table 2:** Indications for Endovascular Thrombectomy​[[2]](#c0024n00038)[[11]](#PowersWJRabinsteinAAAckersonTEtAl.G-9F84C411)

| All must apply: Functionally disabling stroke with deficits associated with proximal cerebral artery occlusion: hemisensorimotor signs, aphasia or neglect, with or without homonymous hemianopia Small-to-moderate ischemic core defined by an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 6 or more on noncontrast CT or CT perfusion (cerebral blood volume map) Intracranial proximal artery occlusion in anterior circulation (distal ICA or proximal middle cerebral artery [M1] or proximal anterior cerebral artery [A1] on CTA); vertebrobasilar occlusions may also be considered, although evidence base is much less certain in these cases Moderate-to-good pial collateral filling on multiphase CTA or evidence of CT perfusion mismatch Aortic arch that is navigable Treatment can be started within 6 h of symptom recognition and within 12 h of when patient last known to be well Special circumstances: For basilar artery occlusions, decision to treat with EVT should be based on the potential risks and benefits, but studies showed benefit​ [8] ​ [9] Highly selected patients who arrive later than 6 h after stroke onset may benefit from EVT if there is imaging and clinical evidence of small core and a large area at risk​ [5] ​ [6] Although benefits are uncertain, some patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions with ASPECTS <6, NIHSS score <6 or mRS >1 may benefit from EVT​ [11] |

### Neurosurgical Intervention

- Ischemic stroke

  - Decompressive hemicraniectomy may be performed on young patients with massive hemispheric infarction associated with significant edema and mass effect (“malignant MCA syndrome” ).​[[2]](#c0024n00038) Evidence from a pooled analysis of 3 small randomized trials found an increase in survival for patients under 60 years of age when treated with craniectomy; however, survivors incurred significant disability resulting in an inability to live independently. Those involved in decision-making should be aware of this significant trade-off.​[[12]](#c0024n00126)
  - Consensus opinion is that patients with large cerebellar infarcts may benefit from surgical decompression.​[[2]](#c0024n00038)

- Intracerebral hemorrhage (see [Figure 3](#c0024n00117))
  - Patients with cerebellar hemorrhage should have an urgent neurosurgical consultation for consideration of posterior fossa craniotomy and evacuation of the hemorrhage.​[[2]](#c0024n00038) The role of neurosurgical intervention for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage is unclear and the subject of ongoing research.​[[13]](#c0024n00127)
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (see [Figure 3](#c0024n00117))

  - Refer patients with suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage immediately to a neurosurgical centre.​[[2]](#c0024n00038)
  - For aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, ablation of the aneurysm reduces the risk of re-bleeding. Endovascular coiling is superior to neurosurgical clipping for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm that is anatomically suitable for either procedure.​[[14]](#c0024n00130)

### General Supportive Care

- Outcomes are optimized by care on a stroke unit provided by a coordinated interdisciplinary team (see [Figure 4](#c0024n00008)).​[[15]](#c0024n00132)
- Supplemental oxygen is not required for patients with normal oxygen saturation levels.​[[2]](#c0024n00038)
- Elevated body temperature is associated with poor outcome after stroke.​[[16]](#c0024n00048) Symptomatic treatment of pyrexia (and investigation of its cause) is recommended.​[[2]](#c0024n00038)
- Begin rehabilitation as soon as patient is medically stable.​[[17]](#TeasellRSalbachNMFoleyNEtAl.Canadia-9F8B94C6)
- Family and community supports are important for social reintegration.​[[17]](#TeasellRSalbachNMFoleyNEtAl.Canadia-9F8B94C6)

### Managing Swallowing and Nutrition​[[17]](#TeasellRSalbachNMFoleyNEtAl.Canadia-9F8B94C6)

- Give nothing by mouth if any of the following are present: reduced level of consciousness, suspected brainstem stroke, severe dysarthria, wet voice, weak cough, impaired palatal sensation, inability to sit, suspected aspiration.
- Bedside dysphagia screen should be performed soon after a stroke; this is best performed by an experienced dysphagia team.
- A videofluoroscopic examination (modified barium swallow) may be required to exclude significant aspiration when the results of the bedside examination are ambiguous.
- A texture-modified diet is appropriate for dysphagic patients at lower risk of aspiration. Additional IV fluids are often necessary for these patients.
- Monitor recovery using serial bedside swallowing assessments +/- additional fluoroscopic assessments as needed.
- Tube feeding (usually nasogastric tube) may be required if significant aspiration is demonstrated or suspected and this is within the goals of care for the patient (some patients may choose to “eat at risk of aspiration”).
- If a nasogastric tube cannot be tolerated or cannot be placed, consider short-term partial parenteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition.
- If swallowing does not improve, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) should be discussed with dysphagia experts. Early initiation of PEG feeding in dysphagic stroke patients is not recommended.​[[18]](#c0024n00053)

### Preventing Venous Thromboembolism​[[2]](#c0024n00038)

- Early mobilization (even if only sitting in a chair) is recommended (as soon as possible after admission to hospital).
- Maintain adequate hydration.
- Intermittent pneumatic compression stockings should be applied as soon as possible within the first 24 hours to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and increase the likelihood of survival after stroke; because they do not cause bleeding, they can be used in patients who have had an intracerebral hemorrhage.​[[19]](#c0024n00190) The use of graduated compression stockings is not recommended because of a lack of efficacy.​

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Ischemic Stroke

### Thrombolytics

Administer IV alteplase (rt-PA) as soon as possible following stroke onset in patients who meet eligibility criteria (see [Figure 1](#c0024n00006), [Table 3](#table-11132232-85FC017C), [Table 4](#c0024n00069) and [Table 5](#c0024n00147)).​[[2]](#c0024n00038) A meta-analysis of individual patient data from 9 randomized trials involving 6756 participants selected on the basis of their clinical presentation and the findings on a noncontrast CT brain scan showed that thrombolysis within 3 hours significantly increased the chance (from 231–329 per 1000 patients treated) of being alive and independent 3–6 months after ischemic stroke.​[[20]](#c0024n00157) Thrombolysis between 3 and 4.5 hours provided a smaller yet still significant benefit (chance of independent survival increased from 301 to 353 per 1000 patients treated). This overall benefit was found despite an increase in early intracranial hemorrhage (5.4% increase compared to the control in the NINDS trial).​[[21]](#ChurilovLMaHCampbellBCVEtAl.Statist-163A6CEB) Select patients who cannot have EVT may benefit from alteplase within 9 hours of stroke onset. The WAKE UP and EXTEND trials showed alteplase was beneficial in carefully selected patients even when administered after >4.5 hours.​[[22]](#ThomallaGSimonsenCZBoutitieFEtAl.MR-163A716F)​[[23]](#MaHCampbellBCVParsonsMWEtAl.Thrombo-9F8BF86C)

Tenecteplase (TNK) is being investigated as an alternative thrombolytic agent to alteplase in stroke treatment. It has greater fibrin specificity, longer half-life, and is administered as a single bolus rather than a one-hour infusion. TNK at 0.25mg/kg (as a single bolus, maximum of 25 mg) has been shown to be non-inferior to alteplase in efficacy and safety; in the ACT trial, similar proportion of patients achieved excellent outcome (36.9% in the TNK group and 34.8% in the alteplase group) without an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (3.4% in the TNK group and 3.2% in the alteplase group).​[[24]](#ParsonsMSprattNBivardAEtAl.ARandomi-163A7491)​[[25]](#c0024n00129) It is not yet approved by Health Canada for this indication.

### Complications of Intravenous Thrombolysis

- **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).** Clinically suspected if there is a sudden deterioration in the patient’s neurological status. Monitor vital signs. Stop infusion and obtain a STAT CT head to rule out ICH. If an ICH is present, it may be reasonable to discuss the case with a neurosurgeon, but there is no randomized controlled trial evidence to support surgical intervention. Supportive care according to the patient’s goals of care is recommended.
- **Allergic reaction (hemilingual angioedema).**​[[26]](#RESTARTCollaboration.EffectsOfAntip-5A9DE552) A small proportion (<5%) of patients who have been taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) will experience hemilingual angioedema when treated with IV thrombolysis; this can be life-threatening. Clinical observation for signs of airway obstruction should be a standard of care following IV thrombolysis. Signs of angioedema (tongue swelling, stridor) should initially be managed by clinicians skilled in airway management. Pharmacological management includes IV steroids and antihistamines.

### Antiplatelet Therapy​[[2]](#c0024n00038)

- ASA is administered as follows:

  - If intracranial hemorrhage is excluded by CT scan but thrombolysis is not indicated, give ASA 160 mg immediately. Follow with ASA 80–325 mg daily.​[[27]](#AntithromboticTrialistsCollaboratio-9F8CE0AF)​[[28]](#refitem-1152124-62027F32)
  - When IV thrombolysis has been administered, wait until intracranial hemorrhage is excluded by CT scan 24 hours after treatment,​[[29]](#refitem-1152125-6202827F) then give ASA 160 mg once followed by ASA 80–325 mg daily.
  - Following EVT, the timing of ASA administration is still debated, but many clinicians will wait until after follow-up imaging has excluded an ICH before starting ASA 80–325 mg daily.
- Administer ASA as a suppository or via nasogastric tube to dysphagic patients. No evidence supports the use of ASA doses greater than 325 mg/day for secondary stroke prevention. The GI side effects of ASA are dose-related.
- For patients who were taking ASA prior to their stroke, other antiplatelet agents, such as clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, dipyridamole/​ASA 200/25 mg twice daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily can be considered. These regimens have not been tested following acute stroke, but have been studied in long-term secondary prevention trials and have been found to be superior to ASA and equivalent to each other in ASA-naive patients.​[[3]](#SaposnikGLebovicGDemchukAEtAlOnBeha-A479DF1A) Dipyridamole-ASA capsules should not be administered via nasogastric tube (see Prevention of Ischemic Stroke).
- For those with TIAs or minor strokes who are not at high risk of bleeding, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for the first 3–4 weeks is recommended.

  - The use of combined ASA and clopidogrel in the first 3–4 weeks after a nondisabling stroke (or a TIA) reduces the risk of major stroke recurrence at 3 months without increasing the likelihood of serious bleeding.​[[30]](#c0024n00191)​[[31]](#JohnstonSCEastonJDFarrantMEtAl.Clop-163ACA69)
  - ASA and ticagrelor combination therapy for 3–4 weeks may be considered as an alternative.​[[32]](#JohnstonSCAmarencoPDenisonHEtAl.NEn-C82D09E4) Additionally, there is strong evidence in support of ticagrelor and ASA use in those with clopidogrel resistance, characterized by CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele.​[[33]](#WangYMengXWangAEtAl.TicagrelorVersu-9F8DBEBE) The prevalence of poor clopidogrel metabolism is 2–15% depending on patients’ ethnic background.​[[34]](#ScottSASangkuhlKGardnerEEEtAl.Clini-9F8E2F0F)
- Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy may be used in select patients (for example, in combination with statins in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis),​[[35]](#FlustyBDeHavenonAPrabhakaranSEtAl.I-9F8E317A) but dual-antiplatelet therapy is generally not recommended for long-term secondary stroke prevention due to risk of bleeding without significant benefit.​[[36]](#DienerH-CBogousslavskyJBrassLMEtAl.-282C255A)​[[37]](#TheSPS3Investigators.xa0xa0EffectsO-282C41D0)​[[38]](#BhattDLFoxKAHackeEEtAl.xa0Clopidogr-282C3325)​[[39]](#JohnstonSCAmarencoPAlbersGWEtAl.NEn-C82D32AF)

### Anticoagulant Therapy

- Systemic anticoagulation initiated immediately after acute ischemic stroke is not routinely recommended.​[[40]](#c0024n00154) There may be special circumstances when this is indicated (e.g., venous infarcts caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or carotid artery free floating thrombus). For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), immediate anticoagulation results in reduction in early recurrent ischemic stroke, but this benefit is offset by an increase in major intracranial and extracranial bleeding.​[[40]](#c0024n00154) For patients with AF and ischemic stroke, most physicians use ASA until an oral anticoagulant is started.
- For patients with AF or other cardioembolic causes of stroke, consider long-term anticoagulation using apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban in preference to warfarin (at a dose to maintain the INR in the range of 2–3).​[[3]](#SaposnikGLebovicGDemchukAEtAlOnBeha-A479DF1A) DOACs are preferred because of reduced risk of bleeding (including intracranial hemorrhage), lack of INR monitoring to ensure the drug is within therapeutic range and fewer drug interactions. For patients who cannot be anticoagulated, use enteric-coated ASA 80–325 mg daily.
- The choice of oral anticoagulant should be based on patient factors including age, renal function, additional health factors, drug interactions, likelihood of adherence and patient preferences. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are contraindicated if ClCr <30 mL/minute; apixaban and edoxaban are contraindicated if ClCr <15mL/minute.
- The best time to initiate anticoagulant therapy is unclear. The “1-3-6-12 day rule” is a known consensus opinion to guide initiation of anticoagulation for nonvalvular AF; patients with TIA would re-institute anticoagulation after 1 day whereas patients with mild, moderate or severe stroke would wait 3, 6 or 12 days, respectively.​[[41]](#c0024n00161) Recent cohort studies have shown it may be safe and beneficial to initiate anticoagulation earlier.​[[42]](#c0024n00183) In practice, it is common to repeat brain imaging after 1–14 days to exclude asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage before starting anticoagulation.

For information on postacute antithrombotic treatment, carotid endarterectomy and risk factor modification, see Prevention of Ischemic Stroke.

### Preventing Venous Thromboembolism​[[2]](#c0024n00038)

There is evidence for both intermittent pneumatic stockings (IPS) or chemoprophylaxis for DVT/PE prevention in acute stroke patients, but there is no data to support the superiority of either approach. In the absence of contraindications, use of low molecular weight heparin **(LMWH)** or unfractionated heparin **(UH)** in prophylactic doses (see Venous Thromboembolism) can be considered in patients with acute ischemic stroke who cannot move one or both lower limbs or mobilize independently.​[[43]](#c0024n00184) Prophylaxis should be stopped once an anticoagulant is prescribed.

### Blood Glucose Management

Hypoglycemia should be corrected immediately. Hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcome after stroke. It is a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy and should be treated.​[[2]](#c0024n00038) Using an SC insulin regimen is recommended since aggressive management of blood glucose using IV insulin did not improve outcomes and was associated with more hypoglycemia.​[[44]](#c0024n00128)

### Blood Pressure–Lowering Treatment

- In patients eligible for alteplase, opinion-based guidelines recommend treating elevated BP to below 180/105 mm Hg before alteplase is given.​[[2]](#c0024n00038) The optimum blood pressure target for ischemic stroke patients treated with alteplase has not been established. ENCHANTED, an international multicentre trial, enrolled patients with mild to moderately severe ischemic stroke treated with alteplase and randomly allocated them to intensive BP reduction (systolic BP 130–140 mm Hg) versus guideline (systolic target <180 mm Hg).​[[45]](#AndersonCSHuangYLindleyRIEtAl.Inten-4384070F) The trial showed intensive BP lowering did not improve functional outcome despite a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage.
- Similarly, optimum blood pressure after EVT is an area of ongoing research. BP-TARGET was a randomized trial of blood pressure targets after successful recanalization with EVT.​[[46]](#MazighiMRichardSLapergueBEtAl.Safet-9F908B6C) It showed that intensive systolic BP reduction (systolic BP 100–29 mm Hg) did not reduce intraparenchymal hemorrhage at 24–36 hours compared with routine systolic BP (systolic BP 130–185 mm Hg), but the mean systolic BP was low in both groups: 128 mm Hg versus 138 mm Hg. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed a correlation between patients’ poor functional outcomes and less systolic BP reduction from baseline.​[[47]](#AnadaniMMaierBEscalardSEtAl.Magnitu-9F90D2AA)

### Hemorrhagic Stroke

### Intracerebral Hemorrhage​[[48]](#ShoamaneshAPatriceLindsayMCastelluc-9F911625)

The mainstay of intracerebral hemorrhage treatments are blood pressure control and anticoagulant reversal, but the effect size of these interventions is small.​[[48]](#ShoamaneshAPatriceLindsayMCastelluc-9F911625)

Treat patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage and an established coagulopathy or a history of warfarin use with **prothrombin complex concentrate**, vitamin K or fresh-frozen plasma to reverse the coagulopathy. Idarucizumab reverses the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.​[[49]](#PollackCVJrReillyPAEikelboomJEtAl.I-163B3CFC) Andexanet alfa is a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) that is not widely available in Canada.​[[50]](#SiegalDMCurnutteJTConnollySJEtAl.An-9F915C67) If there is a persisting strong indication for anticoagulation (e.g., mechanical heart valve), decide when to restart anticoagulant therapy on a case-by-case basis. Administration of **recombinant factor VIIa** prevents hematoma growth, but is not recommended for routine use because it increases the risk of arterial thromboembolic phenomena and does not reduce death or disability.​[[51]](#c0024n00158) Its use in hyperacute ICH (<2 h from onset) is an area of ongoing research.

Intensive BP lowering with IV agents to <140 mm Hg systolic (compared with <180 mm Hg target) in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage is safe but is not associated with clearly improved functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.​​[[52]](#QureshiAIPaleschYYBarsanWGEtAl.Inte-163B3AB8)​[[53]](#AndersonCSHeeleyEHuangYEtAl.RapidBl-163B230D) INTERACT2 showed significantly improved functional outcome using the ordinal shift analysis. A meta-analysis inclusive of these trials showed lowering BP reduced hematoma expansion but did not improve odds of better recovery.​[[54]](#MoullaaliTJWangXSandsetECEtAl.Early-9F91CAD8) In practice, lowering systolic BP to less than 140–160 mm Hg may be reasonable, particularly in patients who present within the first 6 hours with severe hypertension, have imaging markers of hematoma expansion (e.g., spot sign) and have normal renal function.

After the acute phase, manage patients with intracerebral hemorrhage similarly to those with ischemic stroke, except avoid anticoagulants.

In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, the use of LMWH or UH for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is controversial. Intermittent pneumatic stockings should be applied within 24 h, but chemoprophylaxis can be considered 48 h after hematoma stabilization.

Resumption of long-term antithrombotic therapy in this population is an area of ongoing research. RESTART showed treatment with a single antiplatelet agent in ICH patients who have an indication (e.g., coronary artery disease) is safe and does not increase the risk of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage.​[[55]](#RESTARTCollaboration.EffectsOfAntip-9F9201FC) The safety of anticoagulation in patients with ICH and atrial fibrillation was indeterminant in SOSTART.​[[56]](#SoSTARTCollaboration.EffectsOfOralA-9F9238ED) This question is being examined further in several randomized trials.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is not an indication for statin therapy. The indication for statin use should be reviewed if a patient is using a statin; in a trial that included patients with hemorrhagic as well as ischemic stroke, statins use was correlated with a higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage.​[[57]](#AmarencoPBogousslavskyJCallahanA3rd-9F92A7C0)

### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

Treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage is primarily nonpharmacologic (ablation of the bleeding source). Refer patients with suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage to a neurosurgical centre immediately.

Nimodipine 60 mg PO Q4H for 3 weeks reduces the risk of secondary vasospasm and cerebral infarction. Consider a dose of 30 mg PO Q2H in patients who are very sensitive to the BP lowering effects (see [Table 6](#c0024n00148)).​[[58]](#c0024n00125)

### Choices During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Acute Stroke and Pregnancy

Acute stroke management during pregnancy is the topic of a best practice consensus statement.​[[59]](#LadhaniNNNSwarzRHFoleyNEtAlOnBehalf-2839EF23) A Canadian study reported a stroke frequency of 13.4 per 100 000 deliveries, which is at least double than that seen in the general population of young adults.​[[60]](#MariniCRussoTFelzaniG.IncidenceOfSt-28399DAF) Stroke during pregnancy is more likely to be hemorrhagic (about 59% of cases) than ischemic and most often occurs close to the time of delivery and in the postpartum period (about 52% of cases).​[[61]](#LiuSChanW-SRayJGEtAlForTheCanadianP-2839B486)

Risk factors for stroke in pregnancy are older age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome, congenital heart disease, connective tissue disorders, sepsis, severe postpartum hemorrhage, and thrombophilic disorders.​[[61]](#LiuSChanW-SRayJGEtAlForTheCanadianP-2839B486)

Other neurovascular (“stroke overlap”) syndromes, such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, may also be associated with severe preeclampsia.

### Management

An interdisciplinary team approach is preferred to address care and management decisions and should involve those with stroke, obstetrical and maternal-fetal medicine expertise.

Initial emergency investigations and treatment of stroke during pregnancy or within the 6 weeks after delivery are similar to the approach taken in the nonpregnant patient.

There is insufficient evidence to support the safety of antiplatelet agents other than ASA in pregnancy. There are insufficient data on the safety of direct oral anticoagulants in pregnancy. Warfarin is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided, especially between 6 and 12 weeks’ gestational age. When anticoagulation is considered, LMWH is preferred throughout pregnancy.

For intracerebral hemorrhage, the priorities are BP control and the identification and management of coagulopathies.

#### Imaging Considerations

A typical noncontrast CT scan of the pregnant patient’s head exposes the fetus to a negligible amount of radiation. There is a lack of evidence on, but no known harm from, CT contrast. MRI is not associated with fetal risk, but gadolinium enhancement should be avoided.​[[62]](#RayJGVermeulenMJBharathaAEtAl.Assoc-2839F1AB)

#### Thrombolytic Therapy

Pregnant patients were excluded from the trials of alteplase therapy for acute ischemic stroke; however, case reports suggest that the hazards of therapy do not outweigh the benefits. Guidelines advise that alteplase is a reasonable treatment option.​[[59]](#LadhaniNNNSwarzRHFoleyNEtAlOnBehalf-2839EF23)

Patient health considerations are that alteplase may increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after epidural or spinal anesthesia, and bleeding following cesarean delivery.

Alteplase does not cross the placenta.​[[63]](#GartmanEJ.TheUseOfThrombolyticThera-2839F4C8) Therefore, it is not expected or known to pose any direct risk to the fetus.

#### Endovascular Thrombectomy

A pregnant patient with a large vessel occlusion should be offered EVT. Depending on the clinical scenario, it may be reasonable to forgo rt-PA.​

### Acute Stroke and Breastfeeding

Initial emergency investigations and treatment of stroke within the 6 weeks after delivery are similar to the approach taken in the nonpregnant patient. Continuation of breastfeeding after exposure to CT contrast does not pose any known risk to the infant.

Alteplase may increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after epidural or spinal anesthesia, and bleeding following cesarean delivery. It is likely destroyed in the infant’s GI tract. There is probably no hazard to the infant of a breastfeeding patient treated with the drug, though no information is available on the clinical use of alteplase during breastfeeding.​[[63]](#GartmanEJ.TheUseOfThrombolyticThera-2839F4C8)

Low-dose ASA can be considered during breastfeeding since there is evidence that it is not transferred into breast milk, and salicylate levels are low in patients taking daily low-dose ASA.

If anticoagulation is required, **LMWH** and warfarin are both considered safe options during breastfeeding. The safety of DOACs in breastfeeding have not been established.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- The effectiveness of IV thrombolytic therapy and EVT are exquisitely time-dependent; avoid delays. Immediate contact with the patient, rapid triage and (most important) staying with the patient continuously during the clinical assessment, CT scan, blood tests and consent procedures are vital in ensuring that the appropriate steps are being taken as rapidly as possible prior to thrombolytic administration.
- Determining the time of stroke onset is critical in deciding to treat with IV thrombolytics and EVT, but checking the clock is not a natural reaction in the setting of an acute stroke. Encourage patients and families to think of “time anchors” (e.g., what was on the radio or TV at the time, or at what point in the patient’s daily routine the symptoms first began).
- Patients with acute stroke are often unable to communicate. When possible, the next of kin should travel with the patient to provide collateral history and consent for treatment before the time window for intervention closes.
- If the patient is referred to a tertiary-care hospital, send the registration page and results of the STAT blood work (CBC, INR) drawn at the community hospital to the referral centre.
- Waiting for INR and PTT may not be necessary if the patient has no medical condition that affects blood clotting and is not on anticoagulant therapy.
- Signs of infarction on a CT scan done within 4.5 hours of stroke onset are usually subtle. If the CT scan of a patient being considered for acute treatment shows a very definite infarct in a location that explains the presenting clinical symptoms and signs, recheck the time of onset. If the time of onset is accurate, then the patient likely has poor collateral circulation.
