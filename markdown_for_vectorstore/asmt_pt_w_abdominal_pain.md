### Introduction

Abdominal pain is a nonspecific symptom arising from a variety of sources, both internal and external, to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Virtually everyone experiences abdominal symptoms on an intermittent basis and the vast majority of causes are benign in nature; however, these symptoms can significantly impact both personal and societal resources, e.g., dyspepsia alone can account for 5% of family physician visits.​[[1]](#Httpwww.nice.org.ukguidancecg184evi-A3F6E230) This chapter excludes discussion of acute abdominal pain (sudden, severe abdominal pain necessitating emergent care, e.g., ischemic bowel, bowel perforations or obstructions, ruptured spleen, or abdominal aortic aneurysm).

### Pathophysiology

Sites within the GI tract that contribute to the majority of complaints include the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]), stomach (peptic ulcer disease [PUD]), liver (hepatitis), gallbladder (cholelithiasis), pancreas (pancreatitis) and intestines (abdominal hernia, colon cancer, constipation, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], lactose intolerance, infection).

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD) are common functional disorders (i.e., they have no identifiable organic cause) of the GI tract; these are prevalent in both the adult and pediatric populations. Formal classification of functional GI disorder subtypes can be found in the ROME IV criteria.​[[2]](#2016ROMEIV27147121)

Although not a requirement, pain and abdominal discomfort due to IBS are more often localized below the umbilicus. IBS can present as predominant constipation or diarrhea, or a combination of both with alteration in the frequency of bowel movements and/or consistency of the stool. Symptoms of dyspepsia usually arise from the epigastrium and include heartburn, reflux, pain/discomfort and nausea. IBS and FD are not likely to increase the risk of pathologic GI disorders, yet they may significantly impact a patient’s quality of life and increase utilization of health-care resources. Together they account for roughly half of all referrals to outpatient gastroenterology clinics.​[[3]](#psc1029n1003)

There are a number of evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of dyspepsia in adults.​[[1]](#Httpwww.nice.org.ukguidancecg184evi-A3F6E230)​[[4]](#2017ACG_CAG_CPG28631728)​[[5]](#psc1029n1005)​[[6]](#psc1029n1006) In general, the goals are to ensure those with serious GI pathology get prompt investigation and treatment and to minimize use of diagnostic investigations and treatment modalities in those unlikely to have an organic pathology.​[[5]](#psc1029n1005)​[[7]](#psc1029n1007)​[[8]](#psc1029n1008)

### Patient Assessment

### Indications of Serious GI Pathology

Individuals presenting with common symptoms associated with serious GI pathology should seek medical attention. In a study of 169 patients <55 years of age who developed gastric or esophageal cancer, over 97% had at least 1 of the following red flags: dysphagia, unintentional weight loss (>3 kg over 6 months), persistent vomiting, anemia, hematemesis or melena.​[[9]](#psc1029n1009) Additional red flags include age >60 years​[[4]](#2017ACG_CAG_CPG28631728) (especially if new onset dyspepsia or recent change in symptoms); jaundice; family history of cancer, e.g., first-degree relative; and multiple treatment failures. Fever and chills can represent an infectious source of abdominal pain requiring medical assessment (see [Figure 1](#psc1029n00009)).

### Assessment of Patient Acuity

Obtaining a detailed medical history from the person with abdominal pain is important to narrow the possibilities to a few key potential diagnoses. The first step is to rule out the need for urgent medical attention. Acute (<24 hours), well-localized, moderate or severe pain or abdominal distention that worsens over hours and is tender to touch usually indicates a need for immediate medical care. Alternatively, new onset acid reflux with pain to the chest that may radiate to the left arm would also indicate the need for emergent medical attention. The next step is to rule out signs of serious GI pathology. If there are no red flags present, undertake a systematic assessment of abdominal pain. Key assessment information includes location, duration, intensity, radiation, temporal pattern and triggers of pain, comorbid medical conditions, pattern of bowel movements, and medication use. Important information can also be gathered from visual assessment of the patient. A person presenting with overt signs such as new onset of jaundice (yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin) should be referred for immediate medical care. Triggers of pain such as medications and foods may suggest specific disorders such as PUD, GERD, lactose intolerance or celiac disease. Intolerance to foods can also give rise to abdominal pain, especially spicy foods, carbonated beverages, coffee, citrus fruits and high-fat foods. Postprandial pain is often associated with overindulgence. Review timing of pain with meals and current medications (including herbals and vitamins). Evaluate alcohol and recreational drug use (if appropriate). Certain disease states such as renal failure and heart failure may cause abdominal pain; pain is often diffuse in nature in these conditions.

Medications are commonly associated with epigastric abdominal pain (see [Table 1](#psc1029n00034)), and the presence of medication-induced dyspepsia is not necessarily indicative of GI pathology such as bleeding. Comorbid diseases can produce or mimic abdominal pain and may warrant further assessment, e.g., ischemic heart disease or psychiatric disorders. Particular attention should be given to patients using immunosuppressive medications such as systemic corticosteroids, as the symptoms of clinically important GI disease may be attenuated. Extremes in age (very elderly, infants <1 month of age) are often at risk of rapid decompensation and require closer evaluation and monitoring.​[[10]](#psc1029n1010)

### Location of Abdominal Pain

Pain is often, but not always, localized to different areas of the abdomen, and localization often helps determine the most likely cause of the pain. Pain can arise from both visceral and somatic sources (see [Figure 1](#psc1029n00009)). It commonly arises from the epigastric, periumbilical or pelvic regions, as well as from the right, left, upper and lower quadrants.​[[10]](#psc1029n1010)

- More common causes of epigastric pain include GERD, PUD, FD and pancreatitis (the latter also causes back pain).
- Periumbilical pain may be due to gastroenteritis or IBD in addition to IBS.
- Right upper quadrant pain often involves the liver or gallbladder but can also include pancreatitis. Acute onset of severe right upper quadrant pain usually requires medical assessment, as this may be a sign of biliary colic, cholecystitis or biliary obstruction.
- Left upper quadrant pain may involve the spleen but can also include epigastric and musculoskeletal sources of abdominal pain.
- Causes of right lower quadrant pain include appendicitis, IBD, IBS and pelvic organs.
- Small bowel obstruction, IBD, IBS, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and ruptured ovarian cysts can appear as either right or left lower quadrant pain.

### Caveats to Abdominal Pain Assessment

In many cases, the cause of abdominal pain varies with patient age as well as comorbid medical conditions. There is a considerable overlap in symptoms among many of the common disorders that cause abdominal pain, e.g., over 80% of patients with IBS will also exhibit symptoms of dyspepsia.​[[11]](#psc1029n1011) Moderate to intense pain is not a characteristic feature of dyspepsia. In biliary tract disease and pancreatitis, the pain is usually acute and more intense in nature.​[[11]](#psc1029n1011) Epigastric pain that radiates to the back is associated more with a biliary tract or pancreatic source than FD. Recurrent periumbilical abdominal pain occurs in various intensities in approximately 10% of school-aged children. Nausea and vomiting may also occur but weight loss is uncommon. In >90% of cases there is no organic cause. Stress, e.g., school, may be a component. Drug therapy is generally not recommended.​[[12]](#psc1029n1012)

Further investigation into the management of abdominal pain involves a number of factors including previous investigations (labs, imaging, specialist consultations), additional physical findings, and the impact of symptoms or concerns on activities of daily living.
