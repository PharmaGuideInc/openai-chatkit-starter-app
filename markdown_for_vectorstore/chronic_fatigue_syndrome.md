### Introduction

Fatigue, usually short-lived, is a very common complaint in primary care and is often related to some identifiable cause. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), previously referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome,​[[1]](#CDCWebinfo) is characterized by a different degree and type of fatigue. This fatigue is prolonged, unexplained, causes severe impairment in daily function and is distinguished by postexertional malaise (PEM): a worsening of symptoms following even minor exertion, often described by patients as “crashes.” ME/CFS is a chronic multisystem disease that is often life altering. Some 20–30% of ME/CFS cases are severe enough for the person to be homebound or bedbound.​[[2]](#Pendergrast2016)

ME/CFS is found in all ages and socioeconomic groups.​[[3]](#c0056n00120) The estimated prevalence is approximately 1%.​[[4]](#Lim2020) However, approximately 90% of people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed and therefore the true prevalence is unknown.​[[5]](#refitem-116212-FEFF397A)

The precise underlying disease mechanisms of ME/CFS remain elusive (see [Table 1](#c0056n00169)). Several studies have found gene expression changes consistent with the state of chronic activation of the immune system.​[[6]](#c0056n00125)​[[7]](#c0056n00126)​[[8]](#c0056n00127)​[[9]](#c0056n00128) Many of the symptoms experienced by some ME/CFS patients strongly resemble the “sickness behaviour” (fever, malaise, pain, fatigue, poor concentration) that can be induced by the administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines.​[[10]](#c0056n00124) Canadian Blood Services continues to defer individuals with a medical history of ME/CFS from donating blood, citing the lack of consensus among medical professionals regarding the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and concerns that it may be linked to infectious agents potentially transmissible through transfusion.​[[11]](#c0056n00153)

**Table 1:** Suspected Factors in the Etiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

| Persistent microbial infections (e.g., enterovirus)​ [12] Immune response to viral infections (Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, human cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6, SARS-CoV-2)​ [10] ​ [13] ​ [14] Gene expression consistent with the state of chronic activation of the immune system​ [6] ​ [7] ​ [8] ​ [9] Dysbiosis of gut microbiota,​ [15] microbiota-immune axis​ [16] Exposure to toxins, chemicals, pesticides or heavy metals​ [5] Distinct alteration in metabolism, abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways where there is an 80% reduction of specific metabolites; a hypometabolic response to some form of environmental stress and mitochondrial dysfunction​ [17] ​ [18] Muscular biochemical abnormalities​ [19] Genetic abnormalities in genes controlling immune modulation, oxidative stress and apoptosis​ [20] Trauma/prior stressful life events​ [21] |

### Prognosis

While the prognosis remains unclear, it is estimated that full recovery occurs in only 5% of ME/CFS patients.​[[22]](#Cairns2005) It is therefore important to explain to the patient that the condition is managed rather than cured. Current research is aimed at identifying a specific biomarker that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and to aid in understanding the pathophysiology.

### Research Developments

In August 2019, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded the first team grant for myalgic encephalomyelitis. The grant was awarded to [ICanCME: Interdisciplinary Canadian Collaborative ME Research Network](https://icancme.ca/) and has been renewed for 2025.

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms when possible, according to patient preferences
- Validate patients’ experiences and affirm the legitimacy of the disorder
- Educate and promote self-management, including exercise paced to avoid postexertional malaise on one extreme and deconditioning on the other

### Investigations

ME/CFS is a clinical diagnosis, relying entirely on a combination of signs and symptoms and the exclusion of other chronic *active* illnesses that can produce chronic fatigue: *well-controlled* medical conditions do not preclude a diagnosis of ME/CFS if the patient otherwise meets the criteria. Although a diagnosis of ME/CFS cannot be conclusively made before 6 months of fatigue, clinical evaluation should proceed in the interim to rule out other potentially treatable causes of fatigue. Of note, fibromyalgia, mast cell activation syndrome,​[[23]](#Molderings2011)​[[24]](#Molderings2016) hypermobility spectrum disorders including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,​[[25]](#YewKSKamps-SchmittKABorgeR.Hypermob) sleep apnea and irritable bowel syndrome are all common comorbidities.

Several diagnostic criteria exist. The most commonly used include the 2015 National Institutes of Health/Institute of Medicine criteria (see [Table 2](#IOMcriteria2015)) and the 2003 Canadian consensus diagnostic criteria (CCC).​[[26]](#c0056n00136) The more specific CCC criteria (see [Figure 1](#c0056n00155)) are better able to differentiate ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions and are therefore preferred, particularly in research.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke​[[5]](#refitem-116212-FEFF397A) supported a [common data element project for ME/CFS](https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/sites/nindscde/files/Doc/MECFS/Myalgic_Encephalomyelitis_Chronic_Fatigue_Syndrome_CDE_Highlight_Summary.pdf) in 2017 to streamline patient data collection and to determine the preferred tools used in the assessment or examination of patients.​[[28]](#NationalInstituteOfNeurological) For example, the [Beighton score](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/Beighton-Score-2017.pdf) for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the [10-minute NASA Lean test](https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NASA-Lean-Test-Instructions-1.pdf) for orthostatic intolerance and the [Compass-31 questionnaire](https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/COMPASS-31-The-Composite-Autonomic-Symptom-Score.pdf) are the commonly recommended tools for dysautonomia assessment.

Laboratory tests should be normal. Neither viral titers nor neuroimaging studies are required or generally helpful in routine clinical practice. A full summary of laboratory and imaging tests to carry out in patients with suspected ME/CFS has been published by the [US ME/CFS Clinician Coalition](https://mecfscliniciancoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MECFS-Clinician-Coalition-Testing-Recs-V1.pdf).​[[29]](#USMECFSClinicianCoalition.)

**Table 2:** National Academy of Medicine Core Diagnostic Criteria for ME/CFS

| Diagnosis requires that the patient have the following symptoms: | Plus at least 1 of the 2 following manifestations: |
| --- | --- |
| A substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities, that persists for more than 6 months and is accompanied by fatigue, which is often profound, is of new or definite onset (not lifelong), is not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and is not substantially alleviated by rest. Postexertional malaise (PEM) due to systemic exertion intolerance, manifested as an exacerbation of some or all of an individual’s symptoms after seemingly minor physical or cognitive exertion or activity. PEM may result in flulike symptoms; pain; cognitive dysfunction; nausea/gastrointestinal discomfort; weakness/instability; lightheadedness/vertigo; sensory changes; depression/anxiety; sleep disturbances; and difficulty recovering capacity. PEM may be delayed and is unpredictable in duration, potentially lasting hours, days, weeks, and even months. Subjective reports of PEM can be supported by failure to normally reproduce exercise test results (2-day cardiopulmonary exercise tests) and impaired cognitive function. However, this test may induce severe exacerbation of symptoms and is not required for diagnosis. Sleep Abnormalities , which may include insomnia, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep and nonrestorative sleep. Unrefreshing sleep is among the most common symptoms reported by patients. | Cognitive Impairment , which may include short-term memory problems, inability to concentrate, difficulty expressing thoughts, confusion, disorientation and difficulty performing simple activities such as watching television. Slowed information processing is common and may play a role in overall neurocognitive impairment. Neuropsychological testing is not necessary for diagnosis; however, it can be used to observe slowed information processing, memory impairments, reduced attention and impaired psychomotor function. Orthostatic Intolerance , measured by objective heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities and physical findings during standing, bedside orthostatic vital signs, head-up tilt testing, or by patient-reported exacerbation of orthostatic symptoms with standing in day-to-day life. |

### Therapeutic Choices

There are no specific treatments that have been proven to be effective in large randomized trials for ME/CFS, although several interventions can improve symptoms and quality of life. Patients benefit from receiving a positive diagnosis with reasonable explanations of their symptoms. A supportive environment and acknowledgment of suffering are imperative, and treatment should stress nonpharmacologic approaches.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- **Diet:**

  No specific diet or nutritional supplements have been proven to widely benefit this condition.​[[30]](#refitem-1142122-0430F4DC)​[[31]](#refitem-1142123-053B4E8F)

  Encourage a healthy, balanced diet with adequate protein, fresh vegetables and fruit. Patients with CFS may need assistance with shopping and food preparation, and may need to purchase prepared foods. A multivitamin is generally recommended for people who do not have a balanced diet. Correct specific nutritional deficiencies or insufficiencies that occur due to fatigue affecting availability and preparation of balanced meals (see Nutritional Supplements).

  A systematic review of 70 studies of complementary and alternative medicines for treating ME/CFS and fibromyalgia concluded with no definite treatment recommendations.​[[32]](#c0056n00137) Supplements showing potential benefit were L-carnitine, oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and magnesium, but further investigation are needed.​[[32]](#c0056n00137) A systematic review of dietary modification, including specific supplements, found positive outcomes for D-ribose and omega-3 fatty acids but further high-quality research is needed to confirm the findings. The overall level of evidence for supplementation is weak with small sample sizes and inconsistent results.​[[30]](#refitem-1142122-0430F4DC) A small trial of a supplement oxaloacetate showed improvement of mental and physical scores, although it is very expensive.​[[33]](#Cash2022)
- **Orthostatic Intolerance:**

  Assess for orthostatic intolerance, e.g., lightheadedness on standing and/or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which improves in the recumbent position, and manage with increased fluids (2–3 litres per day), sodium, waist high compression garment or abdominal binder, and elevating legs when sitting.​[[20]](#refitem-1182122-48B456A4) Patients should have a passive standing test in the office​[[34]](#LeanTest) and may need to be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment (see Syncope).​[[35]](#Satish2022)
- **Postexertional Malaise, Cognitive Impairment and Fatigue:**

  *Activity pacing* may assist in improving fatigue and quality of life and may be a useful technique for patients with CFS.​[[36]](#c0056n00163) It involves distributing activities throughout the day and dividing them into small, manageable tasks separated by rest breaks. Activities, e.g., laundry, shopping, should not make symptoms worse and patients should avoid “push-crash” cycles (doing too much at once, which causes them to feel worse; after resting they feel better and once again become active, only to again overexert themselves). Patients able to stay within their personal *energy envelope* (expending only the energy that is available within their specific limits, thus avoiding overexertion) have significant improvements in physical functioning and fatigue severity.​[[37]](#c0056n00138) Health-care professionals or occupational or physiotherapists should help patients with CFS maintain appropriate energy expenditures in coordination with personal energy reserves.

  As with physical activity, planning and monitoring cognitive activities throughout the day is recommended. This would avoid mental overexertion and exacerbation of symptoms.
- **Sleep:**

  Address sleep problems early, as they may cause or worsen other symptoms such as fatigue, memory problems, headaches and joint pain. Refer for a sleep study if symptoms of sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleep phase abnormalities or persistent/recurrent daytime sleeping are present. Encourage good sleep hygiene, a very dark cool room, avoiding time on screens in the evening (see Insomnia).
- **General:**

  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention​[[1]](#CDCWebinfo) and NICE​[[38]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-7) no longer recommend *graded exercise therapy*, which encourages patients to gradually increase activity levels. Some patients may experience PEM, in which exertion worsens symptoms.​[[39]](#Vink2020) *Cognitive behavioural therapy* may be offered to those who want support in managing their symptoms, but should never be positioned as a cure for ME/CFS.​[[38]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-7)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Although no definitive pharmacotherapy exists for ME/CFS, patients’ symptoms may be effectively managed and quality of life improved with several medications as needed. Treatment should be individualized and start with the most disruptive symptoms.

- **Cognitive Impairment and Fatigue:**

  Stimulants are not recommended for regular use, but can be helpful for occasional needs.​[[40]](#Bateman2021) One trial found no evidence that modafinil had any significant effects on self-rated physical or mental fatigue, health-related quality of life, or mood.​[[41]](#c0056n00142) Another trial of short-term methylphenidate use had a low rate of positive responders (about 20%).​[[42]](#c0056n00111)
- **Orthostatic Intolerance:**

  Orthostatic intolerance is a common symptom in patients with ME/CFS. Patients with orthostatic intolerance and/or POTS may require a referral to a cardiologist.

  Although the overall quality of the evidence to support the use of pharmacologic choices is low to moderate, the following pharmacologic interventions can be considered in addition to nonpharmacologic interventions:​[[35]](#Satish2022)

  - beta-blockers: propranolol (10–20 mg daily, maximum 40 mg/day) or bisoprolol (2.5–5 mg daily, maximum 5 mg/day)​[[43]](#Moon2018)
  - ivabradine (2.5–7.5 mg BID)
  - midodrine (2.5–15 mg TID)
  - pyridostigmine (30–60 mg up to 3 times daily)

  More evidence is now available for use of pyridostigmine in improving exercise capacity and symptoms of postexertional malaise.​[[44]](#JosephPPariRMillerSEtAl.Neurovascul)​[[45]](#SquiresJAl-ZayerSSystromD.ExerciseC)
- **Pain:**

  Postexertional malaise includes symptoms of deep joint and muscle pain. Patients with ME/CFS may also experience headache and heightened skin sensitivity to touch. Simple analgesics such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs may be considered (see Osteoarthritis for dosing, adverse effects and general considerations regarding analgesics use).

  Low-dose naltrexone (compounded as liquid, starting with 0.5 mg and titrated up to 4.5 mg QHS) may also be considered for the management of pain in patients with ME/CFS.​[[46]](#Bolton2020)​[[47]](#Patten2018)​[[48]](#Kelly2022)
- **Sleep:**

  In the absence of specific diagnosed sleep disorders and if sleep hygiene is unsuccessful, a short-term trial of sedating antihistamines, e.g., diphenhydramine, doxylamine or a prescription **hypnotic** in the smallest possible dose, may be warranted. For more information, see Insomnia.
- **General:**

  Results of randomized controlled trials of antidepressants or other psychotropic agents in the treatment of ME/CFS have been inconsistent.​[[49]](#c0056n00141) Much of the support for antidepressant use in ME/CFS is derived from studies of fatigue associated with other unexplained symptoms or depression. **Tricyclic antidepressants** (TCAs) may induce sedation and orthostatic hypotension. Patients with ME/CFS are prone to these effects because of their fatigue and frequent autonomic lability. TCA doses used in ME/CFS research have been markedly lower than those used for depression.​[[49]](#c0056n00141)

  Short-term use of low-dose **benzodiazepines** (e.g., lorazepam 0.5–1 mg) has been used off-label for PEM or sensory overload.​[[50]](#CarruthersBMVanDeSandeMIDeMeirleirK) Regular use carries a risk of dependency, withdrawal symptoms, and adverse effects of respiratory depression, drowsiness and confusion (see Benzodiazepines (CPhA Monograph)).

  Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by depleting B cells. Although initial small studies suggested possible benefit,​[[51]](#refitem-1162130-009880D9) a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial showed a lack of benefit and an increased risk of adverse effects.​[[52]](#Fluge2019)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

A case series involving 252 pregnancies was published describing the effects of pregnancy on ME/CFS symptoms and vice versa.​[[53]](#c0056n00146) During pregnancy, there was no change in ME/CFS symptoms in 41% of subjects, an improvement of symptoms in 30% and a worsening of symptoms in 29%. After pregnancy, there was no change in 30% of subjects, an improvement in 20% and a worsening in 50%. There was a significantly higher rate of spontaneous abortions and a correspondingly lower rate of live births by vaginal delivery, a finding that could also be due to age or parity. Developmental delays or learning disabilities were significantly more frequent in children born from pregnancies that occurred after the onset of ME/CFS. Larger, prospective-controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.

During pregnancy and breastfeeding, continue nonpharmacologic treatment measures that have been effective. If there is coexisting depression, the risk/benefit ratio may favour continuing treatment with antidepressants during pregnancy and afterwards (see Depression). Medication for other conditions should be reevaluated and adjusted as clinically indicated to protect the fetus.

### Therapeutic Tips

- If medications are to be prescribed for ME/CFS or other conditions, use low doses to start, as patients with ME/CFS often have drug sensitivities.​[[40]](#Bateman2021)
- Avoid polypharmacy; patients with ME/CFS may see multiple care providers. In a population-based case-control study, patients were significantly more likely to use antidepressants, sedatives, muscle relaxants and various nonprescription remedies.​[[54]](#c0056n00144)
- Adverse effects of certain drugs may mimic the symptoms of ME/CFS; evaluate patients carefully for potential drug-induced side effects and drug interactions.
- Due to the lack of adequate sun exposure that often leads to vitamin D deficiency in patients with ME/CFS,​[[55]](#c0056n00165) guidelines recommend considering daily vitamin D supplementation appropriate for the age and gender of the patient.​[[56]](#c0056n00166)​[[57]](#c0056n00168)
- Provide a supportive environment where patients can safely discuss their illness and where the illness is validated. Suggest patient support groups to promote self-management. Online examples include the [National ME/FM Action Network](http://mefmaction.com/) and [Phoenix Rising](http://phoenixrising.me/).
- For patients with symptoms suggestive of mast cell activation syndrome (MACS), a trial of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers may be considered.​[[23]](#Molderings2011)​[[24]](#Molderings2016)
