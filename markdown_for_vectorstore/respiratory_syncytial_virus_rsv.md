### Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes disease starting in the first year of life and continues to do so throughout an individual’s lifespan.​[[1]](#JhaChapter5-03E913A7) RSV is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus transmitted via respiratory droplets and fomites such as door handles. In most Canadian regions, it follows a similar seasonal distribution as influenza, with the start of RSV season in the fall (Sept/Oct), its peak in the winter (Jan/Feb) and its end in the spring (Mar/Apr).​[[2]](#Hawkes-54CFCB82)​[[3]](#Chatterjee2021) In Northern latitudes of Canada, the RSV seasonality is slightly shifted and ranges from December to April/May.​[[4]](#CIG) Surveillance information for circulating RSV disease in Canada is available in the [Respiratory Virus Trends in Canada](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/respiratory-virus-detections/) report.

The F surface protein drives the pathogenesis in its prefusion conformation, which mediates viral entry and the formation of syncytia (the fusion of infected and neighbouring [healthy] cells to form a cytoplasmic mass containing multiple nuclei).​[[5]](#Openshaw2017) The virus causes mild symptoms in most patients; however, superficial damage to the airway lining predisposes the patient to secondary bacterial infections. In vulnerable populations such as infants and older adults, increased viral loads can lead to increased neutrophilic inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts.​[[6]](#Russell2017) Medically attended visits and hospitalizations are often due to lower airway obstructions due to the accumulation of mucus and cell debris from neutrophilic inflammation.​[[7]](#Griffiths2017)

The clinical overlap of RSV with other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, COVID-19), has made diagnosis and surveillance an ongoing challenge. However, the impact of respiratory infections on the health-care system, as demonstrated by COVID-19, has led to increased differential diagnostic testing in the inpatient and outpatient settings; this has allowed for a more precise identification of causative pathogens. Furthermore, recently approved prevention options have provided health-care professionals with important tools to protect their vulnerable patients.

This chapter focuses on the clinical investigations, risk factors for severe RSV disease, and prevention and treatment options for RSV to reduce the impact of the disease on the population.

### Prevention

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent RSV infection, especially in vulnerable pediatric and older adult populations
- Prevent RSV disease from occurring, e.g., bronchiolitis in children; pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic disease(s) in older adults

### Therapeutic Choices

Prevention of RSV consists of infection control protocols, vaccination in pregnant individuals and older adults, and monoclonal antibodies in neonates.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Adults with RSV can spread the disease 1–2 days prior to symptom onset and remain contagious for approximately 14 days following the presentation of symptoms.​[[8]](#Munywoki2015)

General measures to prevent the spread of RSV are the same as for all other respiratory viruses and include:

- Washing hands often; using hand sanitizer if water and soap are not available
- Coughing/sneezing into tissues (or into a sleeve if tissues are not available) and disposing used tissues immediately
- Wearing a mask when ill and unable to be away from others, when caring for someone who is ill, when it is required in a particular setting, or as a personal choice. Children <2 years of age should not wear masks, visors, eye protection or other face coverings due to the potential risk of asphyxiation​[[9]](#BCCDC)
- If RSV symptoms are present, staying home from work or school and not visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities or individuals at high risk of RSV-related complications (e.g., infants, older adults)

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 1](#dt_rsv) lists the vaccines and monoclonal antibodies used in the prevention of RSV.

### RSV Vaccines

- All currently available RSV vaccinations target the pre-fusion F protein of the RSV virus, as it drives pathogenesis and elicits a more effective antibody response.​[[10]](#Graham2015)​[[11]](#Mejias2020)
- Approved vaccines to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in adults ≥60 years of age include the adjuvanted​[[12]](#ArexvyPM) and bivalent​[[13]](#AbrysvoPM) RSV vaccines. Although no head-to-head trial results have been reported, the 2 types of vaccines resulted in similar efficacy in adults ≥60 years of age for clinically defined endpoints such as reduction in RSV-related acute respiratory infection and severe LRTD.​[[14]](#NACI_OlderAdults) Furthermore, the adjuvanted vaccine is indicated in adults 50–59 years of age at increased risk of RSV disease,​[[12]](#ArexvyPM)​[[15]](#Ferguson50y) while the bivalent RSV vaccine is indicated in pregnant individuals at 32–36 weeks’ gestation to prevent lower respiratory disease in the infant.​[[13]](#AbrysvoPM)

  - The adjuvanted vaccine (brand name: Arexvy​[[12]](#ArexvyPM)) demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial against RSV-related acute respiratory infection and severe RSV-related LRTD in adults ≥60 years of age.​[[16]](#AReSVi-006) In another trial studying patients 50–59 years of age at increased risk of RSV disease (e.g., those with diabetes or chronic liver, renal, heart or lung disease), immunogenicity was noninferior to those vaccinated at ≥60 years of age.​[[15]](#Ferguson50y)
  - The bivalent vaccine (brand name: Abrysvo​[[13]](#AbrysvoPM)) demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial against RSV-related acute respiratory infection and LRTI in adults ≥60 years of age.​[[17]](#RENOIR) It also demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial against severe medically attended LRTI through the first 6 months of life in infants born to a vaccinated birthing parent.​[[18]](#MATISSE)
- Current guidelines issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) strongly recommend RSV immunization for adults ≥60 years of age living in nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, as well as all adults ≥75 years of age, particularly those with clinically significant chronic health conditions who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease (for more information, see [List 2](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/respiratory-syncytial-virus.html#a2.2) in the Canadian Immunization Guide [CIG]).​[[14]](#NACI_OlderAdults) Furthermore, NACI recommends that an RSV vaccine be *considered* in adults 60–74 years of age, in consultation with their health-care provider. At time of writing, the adjuvanted vaccine had been approved for use in adults 50–59 years of age at increased risk of RSV disease (e.g., those with diabetes or chronic liver, renal, heart or lung disease);​[[12]](#ArexvyPM) however, NACI had not yet released a statement regarding its use in this patient population.
- According to NACI, immunization with the bivalent RSV vaccine may be considered at 32–36 weeks’ gestation if administration of nirsevimab or palivizumab (see [Monoclonal antibodies](#Monoclonals)) is not feasible or not available.​[[19]](#NACIPeds)
- Currently available RSV vaccines (adjuvanted and bivalent) have demonstrated protection across at least 2 RSV seasons,​[[4]](#CIG) and potentially up to 3 seasons for the adjuvanted RSV vaccine.​[[20]](#3yArexvy) Ongoing data monitoring will guide the future need for revaccination if appropriate.

### Guillain-Barré Syndrome

A small number of participants in RSV vaccine clinical trials developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and early postmarketing surveillance in the United States identified a higher-than-expected number of GBS cases in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), triggering further, in-depth investigation.​[[21]](#ACIPSlides) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the safety surveillance data and provided a favourable benefit-risk ratio for both vaccines. Ongoing GBS safety monitoring was recommended by ACIP.​[[21]](#ACIPSlides)

### Monoclonal antibodies

- Currently available monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization of infants include palivizumab and nirsevimab. Differences between the 2 include the targeted epitope (prefusion RSV F protein for nirsevimab, F protein for palivizumab) and the extended half-life of nirsevimab antibodies, allowing for a single injection (vs. monthly doses for palivizumab).​[[22]](#Brady2023)

  - Nirsevimab demonstrated efficacy in a phase 3 trial against medically attended LRTI and hospitalization for LRTI up to 150 days after administration.​[[23]](#MELODY) This was further validated in a large randomized trial of European infants whereby nirsevimab was effective in preventing hospitalization and very severe RSV-associated LRTI.​[[24]](#HARMONIE)
  - Palivizumab is currently used in a small subset of infants at high risk of RSV disease, namely infants born premature (<30 wk gestation) and/or those <6 months of age with chronic lung or congenital heart disease, or if nirsevimab is not available.​[[4]](#CIG) In a multicentre randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, monthly administration of palivizumab was shown to be safe and effective in preventing serious RSV illness in premature children (≤35 wk gestation) or in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).​[[25]](#IMpact-RSV)
- Current guidelines issued by NACI recognize the burden of RSV for infants in the first year of life and recommend the administration of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab for all infants. Nirsevimab is preferred over palivizumab due to its extended half-life, which means dosing occurs once per season (vs. monthly with palivizumab). Furthermore, when compared with palivizumab, nirsevimab administration resulted in reduction of RSV-associated hospitalizations in high-risk infants.​[[19]](#NACIPeds) If nirsevimab and palivizumab are not available, vaccination of the birthing parent with bivalent RSV vaccine at 32–36 weeks’ gestation may be considered.
- At time of writing, few Canadian provinces are funding nirsevimab administration programs for all infants; in all other jurisdictions, it is funded only for select high-risk infants <24 months of age (for more information, see [List 1](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/respiratory-syncytial-virus.html#a2.1) in the CIG). At time of writing, bivalent vaccination for the birthing parent is publicly funded in only one province in Canada; in all other jurisdictions, it is available for private purchase (or covered through private extended benefits coverage).

### Treatment

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve RSV symptoms through supportive care
- Prevent RSV complications such as medically attended visits, hospitalization and death
- Promote antimicrobial stewardship and reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for viral upper respiratory tract infections

### Investigations

History, with attention to symptoms and their onset, is the key to appropriate testing and use of antiviral agents to manage circulating viral respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, influenza and RSV. All 3 viruses can present with a range of overlapping symptoms categorized as systemic, upper respiratory and lower respiratory:​[[4]](#CIG)​[[26]](#Falsey2014)​[[27]](#Nam2019)​[[28]](#Kodama2017)​[[29]](#Lechien2020)​[[30]](#Walsh2007)

- Systemic symptoms: fever, myalgia, fatigue, headache
- Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI): nasal congestion, sore throat, hoarseness
- Symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI): cough, wheeze, dyspnea, sputum, chest pain

Specific to RSV, 89–95% of infected patients are symptomatic, with the majority exhibiting signs of URTI, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and sore throat.​[[26]](#Falsey2014) Approximately 50% of symptomatic patients will develop systemic symptoms of varying severity.​[[27]](#Nam2019) In symptomatic individuals, LRTI can occur, and in high-risk populations, this can result in bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, all requiring hospitalization.​[[28]](#Kodama2017)​[[29]](#Lechien2020)​[[31]](#Lee2013)

Clinical presentation of RSV in infants is characterized by rhinorrhea, sneezing, pharyngitis, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever or respiratory distress.​[[32]](#Eiland2009) RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, which is the obstruction of small airways caused by acute inflammation, edema and increased mucus production.​[[33]](#AAP2006) For children in their first year of life, bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospital admission.​[[34]](#Wainwright2009)

Diagnostic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of RSV. Viral RNA detection by real-time PCR is preferred to other methods, as antigen testing and viral culture have been shown to have poor sensitivity.​[[26]](#Falsey2014) Historically, some patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILI) may be infected with RSV.​[[26]](#Falsey2014)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Supportive care measures to manage symptoms:​[[32]](#Eiland2009)

- Rest and hydration to manage symptoms of RSV illness
- For infants, more frequent, smaller feeds may be necessary to meet the same total daily feeding amount
- Hand hygiene with water and a soap-based cleanser or ≥60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer to avoid spreading RSV virus to contacts

Sterile saline solution may help to clear nasal secretions; however, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness for bronchiolitis in infants.​[[35]](#Brooks2016)

At-home monitoring of patients is required to determine if a medically attended visit is required; signs and symptoms include:

- Temperature: fever in an infant <3 months of age or fever with temperature >40.5°C in any age should be referred to urgent care (for more fever-related red flags, see Fever)
- Symptom trajectory: in infants, evidence suggests that symptoms tend to worsen over the first 72 hours​[[34]](#Wainwright2009)
- Breathing: signs of respiratory distress in infants may include grunting, nasal flaring, indrawing, retractions or abdominal breathing​[[36]](#CPS2014)
- Food intake: monitor for reduced appetite
- Fluid intake: monitor for signs of dehydration in infants such as a reduction in urine output (the number of wet diaper) and sunken fontanelle

Any changes in the above indicating worsening or no improvement over 3–5 days along with clinical judgment (consider: respiratory status, ability to maintain hydration and risk of progression to severe disease) should prompt a visit to a medical care provider.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Analgesics/Antipyretic Agents

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used for relief of fever, headache and myalgias. Caution patients to avoid the concurrent use of cough and cold products, as they may contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen (increasing risk of overdose) as well as other ingredients such as antihistamines, which may not be needed. Other ingredients contained in cough and cold products (e.g., decongestants, cough suppressants, expectorants) have shown limited benefit and should not be used in children under the age recommended on the label (typically <6–12 y). For children who are dehydrated and/or have reduced feeding intake, use caution with ibuprofen to avoid the risk of acute kidney injury.

Children and adolescents should not take ASA due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome (see Fever).

### Pharmacologic Treatment of Bronchiolitis

Treatment options for bronchiolitis are mostly supportive (e.g., oxygen, hydration; see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#RSV_Tx_NP) for more information). The Canadian Paediatric Society lists the combination of nebulized epinephrine and oral dexamethasone as having equivocal evidence; until more data are available, this combination is not recommended in otherwise healthy children with bronchiolitis.​[[36]](#CPS2014)

The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends *against* the use of corticosteroids, salbutamol, antibiotics, antivirals, nebulized hypertonic and aerosolized saline.​[[36]](#CPS2014)

Further discussion of bronchiolitis treatment is outside the scope of this chapter.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### RSV and Pregnancy

Since the immune response after natural RSV infection is incomplete and short-lived, RSV reinfections occur throughout life.​[[37]](#Walsh2017) However, unlike influenza, there is limited data illustrating the risk of RSV-related complications in healthy pregnant individuals.

### Management

### Prevention of RSV

Vaccination during pregnancy is an option for reducing the risk of medically attended RSV disease in infants during the first year of life. The window for vaccination to ensure placental transfer to the neonate is 32–36 weeks’ gestation.​[[13]](#AbrysvoPM) There is currently no data to indicate that the birthing parent benefits from vaccination, but instead transfers antibodies across the placenta to the neonate.

With regards to preventative options in reducing the burden of RSV disease in infants within the first year of life, NACI preferentially recommends the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (administered at birth or before the first RSV season) over immunization with the bivalent RSV vaccine, due to currently available efficacy and safety data. Although there have been no head-to-head trials comparing nirsevimab and the bivalent RSV vaccine, when comparing preset clinically defined endpoints, nirsevimab demonstrates superior efficacy against hospitalization with RSV-related respiratory tract infection (81% vs. 57%).​[[19]](#NACIPeds) In the bivalent RSV vaccine trial, there was an imbalance in preterm births in the intervention group compared with the placebo group;​[[18]](#MATISSE) however, both groups had lower rates of preterm birth compared with the preterm birth rate of the general population.​[[19]](#NACIPeds)

### Treatment of RSV

Management of symptomatic RSV in pregnant patients includes acetaminophen, which may be used to treat associated pain and fever. NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to potential reduction in amniotic fluid​[[38]](#HC_NSAIDPreg) and the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosis if used in the third trimester.​[[39]](#Koren-19FDB667)
