### Introduction

Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children. It is most prevalent in the late fall to early winter months.​[[1]](#Ortiz-AlvarezOCanadianPaediatricSoc-96865856) The annual incidence of croup is 1.5–6 per 100 in children <6 years of age.​[[2]](#c0041n00024) Though common in children between 6 months and 3 years of age, croup can also occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years of age.​[[2]](#c0041n00024) It is rarely reported in adults.​[[3]](#c0041n00025) Boys are affected more often than girls. Viruses are the most common cause, particularly parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, coronavirus (including COVID-19) and mycoplasma have also been isolated.​[[4]](#c0041n00096)​[[5]](#c0041n00105)​[[6]](#covidCroup)

Croup hospitalizations demonstrate a seasonal pattern, proposed to be related to the temporal prevalence of parainfluenza virus in circulation in the community.​[[7]](#c0041n00119) In Canada, peak hospitalizations occur in October of odd-numbered years, with smaller peaks in February of alternate years. Although croup incidence is greatest between 2 and 3 years of age, infants <1 year of age are at highest risk of hospitalization compared with older children. In Ontario, croup hospitalization rates reached >250 per 100 000 children in the fall of 1993, and thereafter showed sharp decreases coinciding with the widespread introduction of corticosteroid treatment for croup in subsequent years.​[[7]](#c0041n00119)

The majority of affected children can be safely managed at home; very few require artificial airway support.​[[8]](#c0041n00026) More than 60% of children diagnosed with croup have mild symptoms and are treated as outpatients, about 4% are hospitalized and approximately 1 in 5000 children is intubated (approximately 1 in 200 hospitalized children).​[[1]](#Ortiz-AlvarezOCanadianPaediatricSoc-96865856)​[[8]](#c0041n00026)

### Goals of Therapy

- Decrease the duration and severity of symptoms
- Minimize anxiety of the child and parent/caregiver
- Decrease intubations, hospitalizations and return visits to physicians

### Investigations

- Diagnosis of croup, which is most commonly due to a viral infection, requires no specific laboratory or radiologic investigation (see [Table 1](#c0041n00015) for differential diagnosis)
- History with particular attention to symptoms:

  - seal-like barking cough may be preceded by nonspecific cough, rhinorrhea and fever (up to 40°C)
  - symptoms are substantially worse at night, improve during the day and are aggravated by agitation and crying
  - obstructive symptoms generally resolve within 48 hours; a small percentage of children remain symptomatic for up to 6 days​[[1]](#Ortiz-AlvarezOCanadianPaediatricSoc-96865856)​[[9]](#c0041n00028)
- Physical examination for vital signs, stridor, chest wall retractions, respiratory distress:

  - stridor: typically occurs during inspiration but may occur during expiration if severe
  - chest wall retractions and respiratory distress: occur to varying degrees and are indicative of severity
  - respiratory failure: occurs over several hours; signs include reduced respiratory effort, pallor, cyanosis, dusky appearance, decreased breath sounds, and lethargy or a decrease in level of consciousness.
- Objective measurements:
  - lateral and anteroposterior (AP) soft tissue neck films may clarify diagnosis in patients with atypical croup-like disease or in cases where a child is not responding to treatment as expected
  - pulse oximetry is indicated in patients with more severe croup as marked obstruction can result in hypoxia and eventually hypercapnia
  - Westley croup score​[[10]](#c0041n00103) stratifies croup severity into mild (1–2), moderate (3–8) or severe (>8); however, objective scoring systems have little utility in clinical practice; assessment of symptoms (barking cough, stridor, chest wall indrawing and agitation/fatigue) are useful for determination of severity (see [Figure 1](#c0041n00014))

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis for Children Who Present with Acute Onset of Stridor​[[11]](#Croup_Pae_ED)[[12]](#Croup_overview)[[13]](#croup_diag_man)[[14]](#coup_n_child)

| Frequency | Signs and Symptoms | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | Croup |
| Seal-like barking cough, hoarseness, inspiratory stridor, chest wall retractions. May have fever. | Usually worse at night. |
| Less Common | Bacterial tracheitis |
| High fever, barking cough, toxic appearance, copious secretions, productive cough, poor response to nebulized epinephrine. | Most common diagnosis after croup. Often presents following a viral-like illness, after which a child becomes suddenly worse. Respiratory distress and rapid deterioration due to thick, membranous tracheal secretions. |
| Epiglottitis |
| Sudden onset of high fever, dysphagia, drooling, toxic appearance, anxious appearance, and sitting or leaning forward in the “sniffing” position. Absence of barking cough. More likely to present as sore throat. | Increasingly rare after the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. There is risk of progression to complete upper airway obstruction. This is an airway emergency. |
| Rare | Allergic reactions, angioedema |
| Rapid onset of dysphagia, stridor, hypotension, and possible cutaneous manifestations (urticarial rash). | May present at any age. May have personal or family history of allergy. |
| Diphtheria ​ [15] ​ [16] |
| Prodromic symptoms of pharyngitis, low-grade fever, hoarse voice, dysphagia, potentially barking cough and/or inspiratory stridor. Membranous pharyngitis on examination is characteristic. | Extremely rare airway emergency. May present at any age in individual with a history of inadequate immunization. |
| Upper-airway abscess (peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, submandibular cellulitis) ​ [15] |
| Dysphagia, drooling, occasionally stridor, dyspnea, tachypnea, neck stiffness, unilateral cervical adenopathy, swelling sublingual space; onset is typically more gradual, often accompanied by fever. |  |
| Foreign body aspiration |
| Acute onset of stridor, choking or drooling. | Foreign object, most commonly lodged in upper esophagus, causes secondary airway compression. |

### Therapeutic Choices

Patients with mild croup can be managed in the office setting, while those with moderate or severe croup should be referred to an emergency department for treatment and observation (see [Figure 1](#c0041n00014)).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Keep child calm by ensuring a calm and reassuring atmosphere. This will minimize oxygen demand and respiratory muscle fatigue.
- Children with mild to moderate croup may derive adequate short-term relief from breathing in cool air. This can be achieved by dressing them warmly and opening a bedroom window or freezer door for a few minutes while allowing them to breathe in the cool air; the child should not be left alone.
- Oxygen therapy in conjunction with corticosteroids and epinephrine is reserved for children with hypoxia and significant respiratory distress. It should never be forced on a child, especially if it results in significant agitation. Administration of oxygen through a plastic hose with the end opening held near the child’s nose and mouth (called “blow-by” oxygen) is often the most beneficial way of administering oxygen.
- Evidence has established that mist (bedside humidified air, mist tent) is not effective at reducing respiratory distress and should not be used.​[[17]](#c0041n00102)​[[18]](#c0041n00030)​[[19]](#c0041n00100)​[[20]](#c0041n00106) Placing a child in a mist tent—a wet, cold, confined environment separated from parents—may provoke anxiety and agitation.​[[21]](#c0041n00032)
- It is thought that the lower density of a helium-oxygen mixture (relative to nitrogen in room air) allows laminar flow and decreases turbulence in narrowed airways, thus potentially improving ventilation and reducing respiratory distress. Helium-oxygen mixtures (heliox) may benefit children with severe respiratory distress; however, study results have been mixed. There is insufficient evidence to advocate its general use.​[[22]](#c0041n00033)​[[23]](#c0041n00034)​[[24]](#c0041n00035)​[[25]](#c0041n00036)​[[26]](#c0041n00107)

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids (see [Table 2](#c0041n00017)) are the mainstay of therapy for croup, irrespective of clinical severity.​[[29]](#c0041n00097) Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce intubations, duration of intubation, need for re-intubation, rate of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, need for additional inhaled epinephrine and rate of return to a health-care practitioner for persistent croup symptoms.​[[27]](#c0041n00038)​[[29]](#c0041n00097)​[[30]](#c0041n00037)​[[31]](#c0041n00039)​[[32]](#c0041n00040)​[[33]](#c0041n00041)​[[34]](#c0041n00042)​[[35]](#c0041n00043)​[[36]](#c0041n00044)​[[37]](#c0041n00045) Dexamethasone and budesonide relieve symptoms of croup 2–3 hours after treatment.​[[31]](#c0041n00039)

A single oral or parenteral dose of dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg effectively relieves croup symptoms, results in fewer return office visits and hospital admissions, and reduces the length of hospital stay.​[[29]](#c0041n00097) Available evidence suggests that a lower dose (e.g., 0.15 mg/kg) may be sufficient for mild to moderate cases (see [Figure 1](#c0041n00014)).​[[28]](#c0041n00050)​[[38]](#c0041n00108)​[[39]](#c0041n00109)​[[40]](#c0041n00110)​[[41]](#Parker-92375C12)

Nebulized budesonide is effective and equivalent to dexamethasone.​[[31]](#c0041n00039)​[[42]](#c0041n00051)​[[43]](#c0041n00052) Routine use of inhaled budesonide is limited by cost. Patients with severe croup or who are near respiratory failure may benefit from the simultaneous administration of nebulized **budesonide** and L-epinephrine. Inhaled budesonide may also be justified for use in the rare patient who demonstrates sustained vomiting; however, there is no benefit in adding inhaled budesonide to patients receiving systemic dexamethasone.​[[44]](#c0041n00113)

### Inhaled Adrenergic Agonists

Based on historical data, the administration of nebulized L-epinephrine (see [Table 2](#c0041n00017)) in children with severe croup substantially reduces the number requiring an artificial airway.​[[47]](#c0041n00053) Epinephrine reduces respiratory distress within 10 minutes of administration and lasts for more than an hour.​[[10]](#c0041n00103)​[[48]](#c0041n00055)​[[49]](#c0041n00057)​[[50]](#c0041n00058)​[[51]](#c0041n00059) A Cochrane review including data from 8 randomized clinical trials concluded that epinephrine treatment was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in croup score 30 minutes following treatment.​[[52]](#c0041n00111)

Effects of epinephrine administration wear off within 2 hours of administration.​[[10]](#c0041n00103) Though patients treated with epinephrine may return to their “baseline” severity, they do not routinely develop worse symptoms (the so-called rebound effect).​[[10]](#c0041n00103) Both retrospective and prospective studies suggest that patients treated with epinephrine may be safely discharged as long as their symptoms do not recur for at least 2–3 hours after treatment.​[[52]](#c0041n00111)​[[53]](#c0041n00060)​[[54]](#c0041n00061)​[[55]](#c0041n00062)​[[56]](#c0041n00063)​[[57]](#c0041n00064)

L-epinephrine 1:1000 administered via nebulization is as effective and safe as the racemate form, which is no longer available in Canada.​[[52]](#c0041n00111)​[[58]](#c0041n00065) A single-sized dose (5 mL of epinephrine 1:1000) is used in all children regardless of size. Children’s relative size of tidal volume is thought to modulate the dose of drug actually delivered to the upper airway.

Back-to-back administration of epinephrine can be used in children near respiratory failure; however, there is one report of an otherwise normal child with severe croup treated with 3 nebulizations of epinephrine within 1 hour who developed ventricular tachycardia and a myocardial infarction.​[[59]](#c0041n00066) Therefore, administer repeated doses of epinephrine only if a child is near respiratory failure and close cardiac monitoring is possible. If back-to-back epinephrine is considered necessary, the treating physician should contact a pediatric intensivist as soon as possible regarding further treatment and transport.

### Inhaled Beta2-agonists

There are no randomized controlled trials assessing the use of beta2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) in the treatment of croup. However, as these agents have no inherent effect on upper airways, which contain no smooth muscle, benefit is unlikely; therefore, these agents are not recommended in the treatment of croup.

### Analgesics

Analgesics may provide some degree of increased comfort by reducing fever and pain.

### Antitussives and Decongestants

No studies have been published regarding the potential benefit of antitussives or decongestants in children with croup. There is no rational basis for their use. In addition, Health Canada warns against the use of these medications in children under 6 years of age.​[[60]](#GOC_CoughnCold)

### Antibiotics

As croup is a viral disease, antibiotics are not effective in its treatment; however, in rare instances, a bacterial superinfection such as bacterial tracheitis or an alternate diagnosis of epiglottitis or upper airway abscess may be suspected. These infections pose serious potential for rapid deterioration and airway obstruction, and as such, treatment includes monitoring of the airway by skilled personnel in an ICU setting and broad-spectrum IV antibiotic treatment.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Oral dexamethasone (0.15–0.6 mg/kg) is the preferred corticosteroid treatment. If the child is severely ill, vomiting or too distressed to be given oral dexamethasone, consider parenteral dexamethasone or nebulized budesonide. While nebulized budesonide is expensive, IM or IV administration of dexamethasone may be upsetting to an already distressed child.
- The administration of inhaled budesonide in addition to oral dexamethasone is not recommended, as the combination has not been shown to provide additional clinical benefit in children with croup.​[[44]](#c0041n00113)
- Nebulized epinephrine as a single-sized dose (5 mL of epinephrine 1:1000) is used in all children regardless of size. The clinical effect lasts for at least 1 hour and usually dissipates after approximately 2 hours. There is no evidence to suggest a worsening of upper airway obstruction, or rebound effect, after epinephrine treatment.​[[10]](#c0041n00103)
