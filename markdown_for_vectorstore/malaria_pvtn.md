### Introduction

Malaria is an infectious disease transmitted to humans by the bite of a female *Anopheles* mosquito that is infected with Plasmodium protozoa. There are 5 species of Plasmodium recognized to infect humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. The life cycle of the malaria parasite involves cyclical infection of humans and female *Anopheles* mosquitoes​[[1]](#CDCMalariaLifeCycle) ([Figure 1](#MalariaLifeCycle)):

- Infected female *Anopheles* mosquito takes a blood meal and injects Plasmodium parasites into human
- Parasites initially infect liver cells, mature and multiply
- Parasites then infect red blood cells and replicate asexually causing cells to rupture, parasites to be released into bloodstream and more red blood cells to be infected
- Some of the parasites develop into sexual forms and circulate in the bloodstream
- Female *Anopheles* mosquito ingests sexual forms of parasites with blood meal of infected human
- Parasites reproduce sexually in the stomach of the mosquito and eventually travel to mosquito salivary glands
- Mosquito infects new human host at next blood meal

A detailed explanation of the natural history of malaria can be found at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/).​[[1]](#CDCMalariaLifeCycle)

After significant reduction in malaria incidence for many years, rates plateaued in 2015.​[[2]](#WHOWorldMalariaReportannual) Malaria cases and deaths then increased in 2021 compared with previous years (primarily due to disruption in access to services and medications), with >247 million cases and >600 000 deaths in 84 endemic countries. The risk of malaria for travellers is greatest in West Africa and Oceania; intermediate in other areas in Africa, South Asia and South America; and lowest in other areas in Asia and Central America.​[[1]](#CDCMalariaLifeCycle) There is regional and seasonal variation of risk within these areas as temperature, humidity and rainfall are all factors in malaria transmission. Each year in Canada, 400–500 cases of malaria are reported.​[[3]](#PHACSurveillance) The majority of cases are in recent immigrants or people who travel to endemic countries. Very few of the reported travel-related cases had pretravel health consultation.​[[4]](#Savage2019)

Despite medical intervention, infection with P. falciparum can be fatal in up to 20% of severe cases.​[[5]](#CATMATIntroduction) As such, prevention of disease remains the foundation of malaria intervention. Prevention measures include understanding the risk of acquiring malaria infection at the travel destination, taking chemoprophylaxis when appropriate, avoiding mosquito bites during travel and understanding when to seek medical attention, e.g., if fever develops during or after travel.

### Goals of Therapy

- Assess risk of malaria
- Provide safe and effective prophylaxis

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Malaria transmission by the anopheline mosquito mainly occurs between dusk and dawn. It is essential to take protective measures during this time when travelling to endemic countries.

- Use of insect repellents is an important measure to prevent mosquito bites. Insect repellents should be used before outdoor activity during the main hours of malaria transmission. [Table 1](#TableRepellents) compares the various repellents available. If properly used, DEET and icaridin offer very high levels of protection against mosquito bites.​[[17]](#CATMATBiteProtection)
- Use bed nets, preferably impregnated with the insecticide permethrin, and ensure proper installation (see [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/bed-net-use-wallet-cards-english.pdf) for information).​[[18]](#Pryce2018Cochrane) Most bed nets found in Canada expire within 6 months, whereas bed nets distributed in endemic countries have a lifespan of 3–5 years; therefore, travellers are discouraged from leaving Canadian-purchased bed nets in endemic countries during their travels.
- Sleep in an air-conditioned or screened room if possible.
- Wear full-length, loose-fitting, light-colored clothes to cover exposed skin.
- Permethrin-impregnated clothing adds an additional measure of protection; however, there is no Health Canada–approved product available.

**Table 1:** Insect Repellents

| Repellent | DEET(N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) | Icaridin(also known as picaridin) | P-menthane 3,8-diol(PMD; synthetic derivative of oil of lemon eucalyptus) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration​ [a] ​ [b] | Duration of effect depends on concentration: 30% DEET = 4–6 h​ [7] ​ [8] 20% DEET = 4–6 h 15% DEET = 3.5–5.5 h 10% DEET = 2.5–4.5 h 5% DEET = 1.5–2.5 h | Duration of effect depends on concentration: 20% icaridin = 8 h​ [9] ​ [10] 10% icaridin = 5 h | Duration of effect depends on concentration: 30% PMD = variable 10% PMD = <2 h |
| Dosage Adult​ [a] ​ [b] (including pregnant and breastfeeding patients)​ [6] ​ [11] ​ [12] | 1st line: 20–30% DEET Apply every 4–6 h | 1st line: 20% icaridin Apply every 8 h | Alternative |
| Dosage Pediatrics​ [a] ​ [b] (≤12 years of age)​ [6] | 2nd line: ≤10% DEET 2–12 years: apply up to 3 times daily 6 months–2 years: apply daily <6 months: only for travel outside of Canada where there is a greater risk of malaria; ≤10% DEET daily | 1st line: 20% icaridin Apply every 8 h <6 months: only for travel outside of Canada where there is a greater risk of malaria; 10% icaridin daily | 3–12 years: alternative Not recommended for children <3 years of age; alternative option only when DEET or icaridin cannot be used​ [13] ​ [14] ​ [15] |
| Other Considerations | Products containing a combination of DEET and sunscreen may offer less sun protection and increase DEET absorption on skin; avoid if possible. If both products need to be used, sunscreen should be applied first and allowed to penetrate the skin before application of DEET (10–15 min interval between applications is generally sufficient).​ [6] | Icaridin 20% is comparable to DEET across the majority of mosquito vectors and has greater acceptability due to less odour and greasiness.​ [9] ​ [10] | It is not recommended to use the unformulated, essential oil version of oil of lemon eucalyptus.​ [16] |

[a] Duration of efficacy is influenced by factors such as temperature, perspiration, activity, clothing friction, etc. It may be necessary to reapply the product sooner if biting is noticed before the reapplication interval elapses.​[[6]](#CATMATrepellent)

[b] When available, refer to manufacturer’s instructions on duration of efficacy and reapplication.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Principles of Chemoprophylaxis

Prophylaxis recommendations vary among some travel medicine practitioners according to the degree of risk within a country or region. Determinants of malaria risk include endemicity, season, altitude, degree of rural travel and preventive measures for mosquito bites. In some regions of a given country, personal protection measures alone may be sufficient, while malaria chemoprophylaxis may be needed in other regions of the same country. Clinicians without experience and expertise in malaria chemoprophylaxis or who are unable to provide a complete analysis of travel-related risks (infectious and noninfectious) should consider referring patients to a well-recognized travel medicine clinic.

Considerations in choosing chemoprophylaxis include resistance patterns, time-to-travel, side effects, concurrent medications and illnesses, contraindications, pregnancy, age, and allergies. [Table 2](#TableResistance) details the choice of chemoprophylaxis agent according to resistance in a given area of travel. Clinicians are advised to consult an up-to-date source (e.g., [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) or [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html)) about the location and extent of drug-resistant Plasmodium species when counselling patients about malaria chemoprophylaxis, as recommendations may change periodically. [Table 3](#TableDosing) details the dosing schedule required for each agent, i.e., the timeframe required to take medication before and after travel, and [Table 4](#TablePedsPregBF) outlines the recommendations for pediatric, pregnant or breastfeeding patients. [Table 5](#c0105n00020) details side effects, contraindications and dosage information for each agent.

**Table 2:** Choice of Prophylaxis Agent

|  | Plasmodium-falciparumchloroquine-sensitive region | Plasmodium-falciparumchloroquine-resistant region | Plasmodium-falciparumchloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant region |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Region | Central America (north of the Panama Canal) Haiti and Dominican Republic Parts of Mexico | India sub-continent Asia South America Sub-Saharan Africa | Greater Mekong Subregion (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and China regions of Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region) |
| Drug of Choice | Chloroquine​ [a] | Mefloquine or Atovaquone-proguanil or Doxycycline | Atovaquone-proguanil or Doxycycline |
| Alternative Agents | Hydroxychloroquine Mefloquine Atovaquone-proguanil Doxycycline Primaquine (if G6PD normal)​ [b] | Primaquine (if G6PD normal)​ [b] ​ [c] | Primaquine (if G6PD normal)​ [b] ​ [c] |

[a] NOTE: Chloroquine is no longer available in Canada as of 2023; hydroychloroquine can be used as an alternative agent or refer to the management of chloroquine-resistant malaria for treatment options.

[b] Primaquine is a potent oxidizing agent that can induce severe hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. A G6PD level is mandatory before primaquine is used.

[c] Primaquine is 5–10% less effective than the drugs of choice (atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) for the prevention of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria​[[19]](#c0105n00031)​[[20]](#c0105n00088)​[[21]](#c0105n00089) but can be considered in areas of high endemicity for P. vivax such as Central and South America.​[[22]](#c0105n00121)

**Table 3:** Antimalarial Agents Dosing Schedule

| Antimalarial Agent | Number doses/week | Start(time before departure) | Stop(time after return) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chloroquine​ [a] | 1 | 1–2 wk | 4 wk​ [b] |
| Hydroxychloroquine | 1 | 1–2 wk | 4 wk​ [b] |
| Mefloquine | 1 | 3–4 wk​ [c] | 4 wk​ [b] |
| Atovaquone-proguanil | 7 | 1–2 days | 1 wk​ [d] |
| Doxycycline | 7 | 1–2 days | 4 wk​ [b] |
| Primaquine | 7 | 1–2 days | 1 wk​ [d] |

[a] NOTE: Chloroquine is no longer available in Canada as of 2023; hydroychloroquine can be used as an alternative agent or refer to the management of chloroquine-resistant malaria for treatment options.

[b] Agent is not effective against the hepatic form of the parasite, if stopped sooner than 4 weeks after return, parasite may reach the erythrocyte form and result in failure of prophylaxis.

[c] To accommodate last-minute travel, may dose as 250 mg once daily for 3 consecutive days, then 250 mg once weekly thereafter.

[d] Agent is effective against the hepatic form of the parasite; therefore may be discontinued 1 week after return.

### Primaquine Anti-Relapse Therapy (terminal prophylaxis)

Primaquine can also be used for anti-relapse therapy (PART) in patients with normal G6PD who are returning after extended stays (≥6 months) from areas with P. vivax and P. ovale since these species of Plasmodium have a dormant liver form (hypnozoites)​[[19]](#c0105n00031)​[[20]](#c0105n00088)​[[21]](#c0105n00089) that is not affected by chloroquine, atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline or mefloquine. This dormant form may reactivate and cause recurrence of infection 30 days to 5 years after exposure. When used in this context, primaquine is usually added to the standard prophylaxis as a 14-day treatment of postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., after the traveller has left the endemic area). This terminal prophylaxis is generally offered to long-term travellers, expatriates and military personnel who return to Canada, in addition to any travellers with a history of P. vivax or P. ovale disease. Primaquine may be administered for this indication to children of all ages with normal G6PD.

### Malaria Prophylaxis in Children

Malaria morbidity and mortality is significantly greater in children <5 years of age. Nearly 80% of all deaths are in this vulnerable population and there has been little improvement since 2015.​[[2]](#WHOWorldMalariaReportannual) Malaria caused by P. falciparum in particular is associated with higher mortality in this population and may present with non-specific symptoms leading to a risk of delay in diagnosis. Health-care providers should counsel parents on the increased risk to young children and discourage travel to endemic areas when possible. For children planning to visit malarious areas, effective protection against mosquitoes and appropriate chemoprophylaxis is strongly recommended. The drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis in children follows the adult recommendations based upon regional malaria resistance ([Table 2](#TableResistance)) with the exception of doxycycline which is typically contraindicated in children <8 years of age for this indication given the required treatment duration is >21 days. The agents which are safe to use in children are summarized in [Table 4](#TablePedsPregBF).

Administration of antimalarial medications to children may present a challenge as there is a lack of pediatric formulations and many have an unpleasant taste. To mask the taste, tablets may be crushed and mixed with foods such as icing, peanut butter, jam, bananas or infant formula. Health-care providers should order a sufficient quantity of medication to allow for lost doses due to the child spitting or vomiting the medication and should provide clear instructions as to when to repeat lost doses. Compounding pharmacies may be able to dispense the medication in a capsule form to increase the dose accuracy and ease of administration. If travel will be for an extended period of time, dosage adjustment due to increasing weight of a growing child must be considered.​[[36]](#CATMATChildren)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Malaria Prophylaxis during Pregnancy

Pregnant patients are more susceptible to malaria (anopheline mosquitoes are more attracted to pregnant than nonpregnant humans) and, once infected, exhibit higher morbidity and mortality rates than the nonpregnant population.​[[37]](#c0105n00093) Malaria in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects in both the pregnant patient (e.g., anemia) and the infant (e.g., low birth weight, fetal death). In addition, premature labour may result from fever causing uterine contractions.​[[38]](#c0105n00117) The risk of adverse effects from malaria is highest in those with P. falciparum malaria and in those who have not been exposed to malaria before. Adverse events associated with P. vivax malaria tend to be less severe. Since the consequences of malaria in pregnancy are potentially serious, pregnant patients should ideally defer travel. For those who must travel to malarious areas, special consideration should be taken; however, even the best personal protection measures, including chemoprophylaxis, are not always effective.

Avoidance and prevention of bites should be recommended as for patients who are not pregnant (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0105n00010)). Although DEET crosses the placenta, DEET-containing repellents are highly recommended.​[[11]](#c0105n00118) Pyrethroid derivatives such as permethrin can also be safely used to impregnate bed nets.

Use of chemoprophylaxis has been associated with a reduced risk of severe anemia, placental parasitemia and low birth weight.​[[39]](#RadevaPetrova2014)​[[40]](#Eisele2012)​[[41]](#Muanda2015)

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a long history of safe use during pregnancy and are recommended for prophylaxis in areas sensitive to chloroquine. Mefloquine has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth at the treatment dosage,​[[42]](#Nosten1999) but there is substantial evidence that the dosage used for prophylaxis is not associated with either an increased risk of stillbirth or malformation in the second and third trimester. In addition, the use of mefloquine at any time from conception through to the third trimester showed rates of birth defects and fetal loss comparable to the general population.​[[43]](#Schlagenhauf2012) Mefloquine remains the drug of choice for pregnant patients in all trimesters who require malaria prophylaxis in a chloroquine-resistant area.​[[23]](#c0105n00122)​[[24]](#Gonzalez2018) There is currently no approved chemoprophylaxis for pregnant patients who travel to chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant areas; however, in the absence of other options, atovaquone-proguanil may be considered after the first trimester if the benefits outweigh the risks. The agents that are safe to use in pregnancy are summarized in [Table 4](#TablePedsPregBF).

### Malaria Prophylaxis during Breastfeeding

Avoidance and prevention of bites should be recommended as for patients who are not breastfeeding (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0105n00010)). Breastfeeding patients may use DEET-containing mosquito repellents on exposed skin. No adverse effects have been reported among children breastfed by patients who use DEET.​[[12]](#Koren2003)

There is little evidence-based information on malaria chemoprophylaxis in breastfeeding travellers. Breastfeeding is safe when using chemoprophylaxis agents that are safe for use in infants (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil in infants ≥5 kg).​[[44]](#CATMATPregnantBF) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, no untoward effects have been found in infants of breastfeeding patients using tetracyclines, suggesting that doxycycline should be safe.​[[45]](#AmAcadPeds2001) No data are available on the use of primaquine during breastfeeding or the excretion of primaquine in breast milk. Primaquine is contraindicated during breastfeeding unless normal G6PD activities have been documented in both the breastfeeding patient and the infant. The agents that are safe to use in breastfeeding patients are summarized in [Table 4](#TablePedsPregBF).

Breastfed children do not receive sufficient drug in breast milk to protect them from malaria and must receive recommended dosages of chemoprophylaxis.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**Table 4:** Malaria Chemoprophylaxis in Special Populations​[[22]](#c0105n00121)

| Agent | Children | Pregnant Patients | Breastfeeding Patients |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chloroquine​ [a] | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Mefloquine | Yes >5 kg​ [b] | Yes​ [1] ​ [23] ​ [24] | Yes |
| Atovaquone-proguanil | Yes >5 kg | No​ [c] May be considered in second or third trimester in pregnant patients travelling to mefloquine-resistant area after discussion of the benefits and risks | Yes for child >5 kg.​ [25] No data for child <5 kg; may be used if benefits outweigh risks |
| Doxycycline | Yes >8 y | No​ [d] | Yes |
| Primaquine | Yes, IF normal G6PD | No​ [e] | Yes, IF G6PD normal in breastfeeding patient and child |

[a] NOTE: Chloroquine is no longer available in Canada as of 2023; hydroychloroquine can be used as an alternative agent or refer to the management of chloroquine-resistant malaria for treatment options.

[b] Manufacturer does not recommend mefloquine use in children <5 kg due to lack of data on bioavailability and metabolism; however, Health Canada indicates mefloquine 5 mg/kg once a week may be considered for all children at high risk of malaria.

[c] Patients should be advised to avoid pregnancy during chemoprophylaxis and for 3 weeks after atovaquone-proguanil. However, becoming pregnant during antimalarial chemoprophylaxis is not considered an indication for pregnancy termination.

[d] Patients should be advised to avoid pregnancy during chemoprophylaxis and for 1 week after doxycycline. However, becoming pregnant during antimalarial chemoprophylaxis is not considered an indication for pregnancy termination.

[e] Becoming pregnant during antimalarial chemoprophylaxis is not considered an indication for pregnancy termination.

### Therapeutic Tips

- There is no vaccine approved in Canada to prevent malaria in travellers. WHO recommends the programmatic use of the available malaria vaccines (**RTS,S** and **R21**) for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in malaria endemic areas.​[[46]](#WHOvaccines)
- Verify the malaria risk and recommended chemoprophylaxis for the regions the travellers will be visiting with the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/about-catmat/appendix-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic.html). Travellers may also consult the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html).
- No currently available regimen of malaria chemoprophylaxis is ideal and completely effective. Adhering to the chemoprophylaxis regimen helps reduce the risk of malaria. Drug-resistant malaria continues to spread.
- Remind travellers in writing to continue taking their antimalarials even after their return from an endemic region. All travellers in whom fever develops within 1 year (particularly within 3 months) of return from a malaria-endemic area must be considered to have malaria, regardless of chemoprophylaxis. Consider this a medical emergency. Request a malaria screen with thick and thin smear and, where available, a rapid diagnostic test. If negative, repeat them twice over 48 hours.
- Advise travellers to buy their full supply of medications before departure. The sale of poor-quality and counterfeit antimalarials is an issue in the some parts of the world.

### Drug Table

**Table 5:** Drugs Used for Malaria Chemoprophylaxis

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antimalarials, combination**

Contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (ClCr <30 mL/min). Treatment failures have been reported in patients >100 kg.​ [26] |

**Drug Class: Quinoline Derivatives**

| hydroxychloroquine sulfate Plaquenil , generics <$15 | Each tablet contains hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg (equivalent to hydroxychloroquine base 155 mg ) Start 1–2 wk prior to exposure and continue weekly for 4 wk after leaving the endemic area Administer with food Adults: 400 mg sulfate salt (310 mg base) once/wk PO Children: 6.5 mg/kg sulfate salt (5 mg/kg base) once/wk PO. Maximum: 400 mg sulfate salt (310 mg base) once/wk PO If it is not possible to initiate hydroxychloroquine 1–2 wk prior to exposure, a loading dose can be given to rapidly achieve the effective levels: Loading dose, adults: 800 mg sulfate salt taken in 2 divided doses, 6 h apart Loading dose, children: 13 mg/kg sulfate salt taken in 2 divided doses, 6 h apart | Common: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, urticaria, dizziness, blurred vision, headache. Uncommon: hair depigmentation, skin eruptions, myopathy, reversible corneal opacity, partial alopecia, blood dyscrasias. Rare: deafness, hypoglycemia (may be serious and life threatening), myopathy, nail and mucous membrane discoloration, photophobia, retinopathy. | Alternative to chloroquine which was removed from market in Canada in 2023. Safe to use in pregnancy. Retinal toxicity is a concern with continuous use (cumulative dose >100 g chloroquine base). Screen for retinal changes every 6–12 months if taking hydroxychloroquine for >5 y, sooner if risk factors present.​ [27] Avoid in patients with psoriasis as it may exacerbate the condition. May cause seizures; avoid in patients with history of epilepsy. No pediatric formulation is available in Canada and drug has an exceptionally bitter taste. Crushed tablets can be difficult to manipulate and store. The powder must be mixed with a sweet food. Alternatively, a compounding pharmacist can prepare a flavoured suspension or capsule dosage form. |
| mefloquine generics $15–30 | Each tablet contains 250 mg mefloquine base present as mefloquine hydrochloride (the amount of mefloquine base present in mefloquine tablets varies between countries)​ [28] Start at least 2 wk prior to exposure and continue weekly for 4 wk after leaving the endemic area Administer with food and with at least 240 mL of water Adults: 250 mg (1 tablet) once/wk PO Children: ≤10 kg: 5 mg/kg once/wk PO >10–20 kg: 62.5 mg (¼ tablet) once/wk PO >20–30 kg: 125 mg (½ tablet) once/wk PO >30–45 kg: 187.5 mg (¾ tablet) once/wk PO >45 kg: 250 mg (1 tablet) once/wk PO For last–minute travel, a loading dose can be given to rapidly achieve the effective levels: >45 kg: 250 mg daily PO for 3 days, then 250 mg weekly thereafter | Common: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sinus bradycardia, nightmares, insomnia, mood alteration, anxiety, irritability. Uncommon: hair loss, skin rash. Rare: permanent dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance; seizures; psychosis; thrombotic-thrombocytopenia purpura. | Considered drug of choice for pregnant patients who require malaria prophylaxis in a chloroquine-resistant area. Contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders, self-endangering behaviour, suicide attempts or suicidal ideations.​ [29] ​ [30] Severe neurological and psychiatric reactions (seizures and psychosis) occur rarely in patients who use the drug at appropriate prophylactic doses.​ [31] ​ [32] In clinical trials, side effects of mefloquine severe enough to require discontinuation occurred in about 5% of users. Less severe but disabling neuropsychological side effects (anxiety, abnormal dreams, insomnia, depression, irritability) are more common.​ [31] ​ [32] ​ [33] ​ [34] Other adverse effects (dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance or tinnitus) can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent.​ [29] ​ [30] Loading dose is associated with an increased risk of depression. When possible, mefloquine may be started 4 wk prior to departure to allow time to assess for adverse effects prior to travel since 70% of severe adverse reactions occur within the first 3 doses. |
| primaquine phosphate Primaquine <$15 | Each tablet contains primaquine base 15 mg (equivalent to primaquine phosphate 26.3 mg ). Doses expressed in primaquine base Start 1–2 days prior to exposure, continue daily while in the malarial region and for 7 days after leaving the endemic area Administer with food Adults: Primary prophylaxis: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO. Maximum: 30 mg base or 2 tablets daily PO Terminal prophylaxis: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO × 14 days Children (>9 y): Primary prophylaxis: 0.5 mg base/kg/day PO. Maximum: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO Terminal prophylaxis: 0.5 mg base/kg/day PO × 14 days. Maximum: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO | Common: hemolysis with G6PD deficiency. Uncommon: GI upset (take with food). Rare: methemoglobinemia. | Primaquine is a potent oxidizing agent that can induce severe hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. A G6PD level is mandatory before primaquine is used. Contraindicated in pregnancy because of unknown G6PD status of infant and subsequent risk of hemolysis. Methemoglobinemia has been precipitated in HIV-infected patients who are being treated or are on prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, especially if taken with dapsone. |

**Drug Class: Tetracyclines**

| doxycycline generics $15–30 | Start 1–2 days prior to exposure; continue daily while in the malarial region and for 4 wk after leaving the endemic area Administer with food and plenty of water. Important not to recline for 30–60 min after administration Adults: 100 mg daily PO Children: >8 y: 2 mg/kg/day PO. Maximum: 100 mg/day | Common: GI upset, photosensitivity, staining of teeth in children and fetuses, candida vaginitis (use fluconazole for self-treatment). Uncommon: azotemia in renal disease, enterocolitis. Rare: allergic reactions, blood dyscrasias, esophageal ulcerations. | Contraindicated in pregnancy. Contraindicated in children <8 y unless there are no other treatment options. Note that doxycycline can be administered for short durations (21 days or less) regardless of patient age.​ [35] Because of the increased risk of photosensitivity, use sunscreens to block UV radiation. |
