### Introduction

The majority of sports injuries encountered in primary care settings involve the soft tissues (strains, sprains and contusions), bony anatomy (fractures and stress fractures) or joints (dislocations, degeneration and cartilage defects).

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce recurrences and acute symptoms, e.g., pain, inflammation
- Correct contributing factors, e.g., malalignment, muscle weakness
- Return the individual’s weight-bearing capability, flexibility, range of motion, strength and proprioception to normal
- Enable the individual to participate comfortably, safely and fully in all pre-injury activities

### Therapeutic Choices

For management of specific injuries, see [Table 1](#c0062n00006).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Acute treatment is best summarized by the RICE protocol:

- **R**est the injured part for a short time period; mobilize when feasible as early mobilization aids healing.
- **I**ce: Wrap an ice bag or cold pack in a damp, thin cloth and apply to the injured area for 15–20 minutes at a time, at least QID for the first 48 hours (or longer if swelling continues).
- **C**ompress with an elastic bandage if there is swelling such as in an ankle sprain.
- **E**levation: Try to elevate the injured part above the heart.

Initial rehabilitation is directed toward allowing the injured tissues to heal. Aggravation of the injury must be avoided, but alternative activities should be encouraged, e.g., the runner with a stress fracture of the fibula should not run, but can swim or run in deep water. The next phase is directed toward restoring and improving range of motion, strength, endurance and proprioception. A progression toward full activity is then undertaken. Before the patient resumes activity, any factors that may have contributed to the injury (muscle imbalances, improper footwear, training errors, poor protective equipment) should be addressed, and sport-specific skills regained.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Oral or topical NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) can decrease swelling and discomfort but should be used for short periods only (for more detailed information on specific drugs, see Acute Pain). In the elderly, acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs should be considered for initial and ongoing treatment of persistent pain, particularly musculoskeletal pain. Elderly patients are more likely to experience adverse drug reactions; the benefits of NSAID therapy must be weighed against their potential risks (dyspepsia, GI bleeding, renal impairment, blood pressure elevation). For more information regarding risk-management approaches and risks associated with the use of NSAIDs, see Osteoarthritis.

Intra-articular or peritendinous injection of corticosteroids such as triamcinolone **acetonide**, methylprednisolone **acetate** or betamethasone may be useful in treating specific injuries (see [Table 1](#c0062n00006)). These injections are used with some success but may have risks, especially following multiple injections or improper injection to a site, e.g., into the tendon. Ultrasound-guided joint and soft tissue interventions are preferable to palpation-guided injections in terms of improved accuracy, patient satisfaction and reduced complications.​[[44]](#refitem-1142141-FE76584C) A systematic review of peritendinous corticosteroid injections suggested that while there is good evidence of short-term benefit (pain reduction) in treating tendinopathies, the effectiveness of therapy varied with the injury site and evidence for long-term benefit is lacking (high risk of recurrence).​[[11]](#c0062n00065)​[[45]](#c0062n00069) See Osteoarthritis, Table 4 for more information on intra-articular corticosteroids.

Topical nitroglycerin patches effectively reduce pain associated with activities of daily living in patients with chronic tendinopathies.​[[5]](#c0062n00086) Consider using one-quarter to one-half of a nitroglycerin 0.2 mg/h matrix patch (e.g., Nitro-Dur, Trinipatch) every 24 hours on the affected area, rotating the application site with each application. The most common side effect of a nitroglycerin patch is headache, but patients may also experience skin rash, dizziness and hypotension. Use with caution in the elderly or patients taking antihypertensives, due to the increased risk of orthostatic hypotension. Coadministration of nitrates (including topical) and PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is contraindicated.

Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the source of chronic tendinopathy pain, including neuropathy as a contributing factor. Local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, is known to relieve pain by inhibiting the depolarization and firing of sensory nerve fibers through sodium channel blockade, a potential component of neuropathic pain.​[[46]](#Gammaitoni2013) Topical lidocaine may be effective for providing dermal analgesia and may play a role in the management of muscle/tendon and joint pain.​[[46]](#Gammaitoni2013)

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or autologous blood injections, supplement the inflamed tendon with natural growth factors to stimulate the healing process.​[[47]](#c0062n00077) Platelet-rich plasma injections may become a cost-effective alternative to surgery in resistant and chronic tendinopathies. They have been studied for the treatment of specific tendon injuries with mixed results (see [Table 1](#c0062n00006)).​[[48]](#c0062n00079)​[[49]](#refitem-11621501-04170AD5) Additional high-quality research is needed to assess the efficacy of PRP injections for the treatment of tendinopathies. Research examining the use of PRP in the management of knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) compared to other intra-articular therapies, such as cortisone, has shown that PRP is a safe treatment with potential to provide symptomatic benefit for OA in the short term (up to 12 months).​[[50]](#refitem-1142144-FE77CBA5) Further studies are required to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PRP, the patients most likely to benefit, and optimal PRP protocols.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The same principles of injury treatment apply to both nonpregnant and pregnant or breastfeeding athletes, with the following exceptions: a clinical evaluation of each pregnant patient before recommending an exercise program. In the absence of absolute (e.g., incompetent cervix, multiparity, heart disease, bleeding) and relative (e.g., intrauterine growth retardation, poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes) contraindications to exercise in pregnancy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant patients continue and/or initiate safe physical activities.​[[51]](#c0062n00037)

Participation in sports with a high risk of contact, falling or abdominal trauma should be avoided. Supine positions should be avoided, particularly after the first trimester, due to the potential for compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus, and the effect on the maternal cardiac output.​[[51]](#c0062n00037) An increase in musculoskeletal injury rates during pregnancy has not been shown, despite increased ligamentous laxity found in pregnancy that is believed to be related to estrogen and relaxin; this is likely due to decreased participation in jumping, pivoting and contact activities in the later stages of pregnancy when this ligamentous laxity is greater.​[[52]](#c0062n00035)

Moderate exercise during breastfeeding does not affect the quantity or composition of breast milk.​[[53]](#c0062n00038)

For sports injuries in pregnancy and lactation:

- Acetaminophen is preferred if analgesia is required (see Acute Pain). NSAIDs can safely be used during breastfeeding but avoid use in the third trimester of pregnancy as use in late pregnancy is associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Health Canada recently started investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant patients 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[[54]](#HCNSAIDsPregnancy) This investigation is in response to a US FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[[55]](#FDANSAIDs2020) Ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid may be considered if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected.
- Shockwave therapy is generally considered contraindicated in pregnant patients.
- If nonpharmacologic therapy and acetaminophen have been used without success, **injectable** corticosteroids may be considered in a pregnant patient. Small amounts of corticosteroid plus lidocaine injections appear to be safe in breastfeeding patients but nonpharmacologic options remain the treatment of choice.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Therapeutic choices that are effective for acute pain related to sports injuries are not always effective for chronic pain, e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections. Use caution when prescribing these agents for longer than 6 weeks.
- Consider using topical rather than oral NSAIDs for patients who are elderly or have cardiovascular or GI disease.​[[56]](#c0062n00070)

### Management of Common Sports Injuries

**Table 1:** Management of Specific Sports Injuries

| Injury | Investigations | Therapeutic Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supraspinatus Tendinosis (Rotator Cuff Disorders) Tendinosis, degenerative tears, acute tears (partial or full thickness), less commonly overuse inflammation (tendinopathy) of the rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. These muscles act as movers (rotation, initial abduction) and stabilizers of the humeral head in the glenoid. Often results in subacromial impingement of supraspinatus (cuff muscle) and subacromial bursa. | History: Sudden pain if traumatic onset (e.g., fall), gradual onset of pain if tendinosis that radiates to the deltoid area. Discomfort noted with shoulder movement, especially reaching away from the body or overhead. Often painful at night with difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position. Weakness results if complete or significant partial tear. Physical examination: Wasting may be noted if full thickness tear. Pain on active ROM and resisted tests depending on injury type and location. Weakness is present with more significant tear. If subacromial impingement, often get “painful arc” in flexion or abduction, pain with Hawkins-Kennedy test (pain when shoulder placed at 90° of flexion and internally rotated). Test for glenohumeral instability. Imaging: X-ray if concern of bony injury (acute trauma) or osteoarthritis. Ultrasound good at detecting rotator cuff injury and bursitis. MRI can detect additional shoulder pathology. Refer if: X-rays show growth plate injuries in skeletally immature patients or fracture in patients >50 y. Acute full thickness rotator cuff injuries should be assessed by an orthopedic surgeon. | Rest from aggravating activities. Ice may help if acute injury. NSAID s (oral or topical) for acute pain. May need short-term analgesic medication, e.g., acetaminophen either alone or in a combination product containing a weak opioid ( codeine or tramadol ) for nighttime pain. Physiotherapy or home-based exercise program​ [1] : strengthening of scapular stabilizers, correction of impaired scapulohumeral rhythm, addressing soft tissue tightness followed by rotator cuff strengthening. Persistent impingement symptoms or bursitis may benefit from an imaging guided subacromial corticosteroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg mixed with 2– 3 mL lidocaine 1%) followed by resumption of exercise program.​ [2] Repeated corticosteroid injections may, however, increase re-tear rates and requirement for repeat surgery.​ [3] Shockwave therapy by a physiotherapist may be considered, especially in calcific tendinopathy.​ [4] Nitroglycerin transdermal patch (one-quarter to one-half of a 0.2 mg/h patch) Q24H for 6–12 wk directly over the site of injury enhances subjective and objective recovery of patients with supraspinatus tendinosis.​ [5] ​ [6] ​ [7] Consider imaging-guided PRP injection for chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy and partial tears if resistant to conservative management.​ [8] In small- and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, surgical interventions may not offer a significant benefit.​ [9] Consider surgical intervention to repair acute full thickness tear in younger, active individuals. |
| Lateral Epicondylosis (“Tennis Elbow”) Tendinosis of the common extensor tendon at its origin at the lateral epicondyle. Medial Epicondylosis (“Golfer's Elbow”) Tendinosis of the common flexor/pronator tendon at its origin at the medial epicondyle. | History: Pain at the lateral elbow or medial elbow usually due to overuse and/or faulty mechanics. Physical examination: Tenderness just distal to the lateral or medial epicondyle, painful resisted wrist extension and grip (lateral epicondylosis), painful resisted wrist flexion (medial epicondylosis). X-rays: Rarely required (only if any concern about bony pathology; may confirm calcific tendinopathy). Refer if: Neurologic symptoms, loss of ROM in elbow (further evaluation needed to rule out pathologies, e.g., osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial tunnel syndrome, posterior interosseous nerve compression). | Rest from aggravating activities; cryotherapy; counter-force brace/band; stretching/strengthening of the wrist extensors/flexors. NSAID s (oral or topical) for initial pain and inflammation in first 4 wk of condition. Physiotherapy:​ [10] acupuncture, dry needling, mobilizations, soft tissue techniques, stretching. Eccentric strengthening exercises. Correction of predisposing factors: in tennis—correct poor technique and biomechanics, especially backhand stroke, correct racquet grip size and string tension; use lighter racquet. Consider work/occupation ergonomic factors. Corticosteroid injection (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide 20 mg) to common extensor origin area at lateral epicondyle or common flexor origin at medial epicondyle may provide short-term pain relief but is associated with worse clinical outcomes at 1 y, e.g., pain, recurrence.​ [11] ​ [12] Consider applying nitroglycerin transdermal patch (one-quarter to one-half of a 0.2 mg/h patch) Q24H on elbow for 6–12 wk.​ [13] ​ [14] Consider referral to sports medicine physician for PRP autologous blood injection at the site of the tendinosis; may reduce pain and improve function.​ [15] ​ [16] ​ [17] Autologous blood injections are more effective than corticosteroid injections for reducing pain and disability in patients with tennis elbow in both the short and long term.​ [18] ​ [19] Consider referral to radiologist or sports medicine physician for sonographically guided percutaneous tenotomy (dry needling) at the site of tendinosis.​ [20] |
| Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (“Runner's Knee,” chondromalacia patellae) Anterior knee pain resulting from patellofemoral articulation dysfunction. | History: Anterior knee pain, worse with prolonged flexion/sitting, running, stairs. Physical examination: Impairments affecting the patellofemoral joint interface may be a consequence of muscle imbalance (weak VMO ), tightness (hamstring or iliotibial band), malalignment i.e., increased Q angle. Pain with patellar pressure, medial quadriceps ( VMO ) weakness, lateral patellar tracking, poor control with single knee bends. X-rays: Include skyline view of patella if trauma or bony pathology is a concern or to assess for patellofemoral arthritis or other conditions. Refer if: Patient develops joint effusion. | Relief of acute symptoms: rest from aggravating activities (emphasize alternative activities); ice, both PRN and post-activity; NSAID s (oral or topical) for acute pain. Correction of contributing factors: foot overpronation—appropriate stability/motion control shoes with good medial arch and support. If severe, may require custom foot orthotic. Physiotherapy: general quadriceps and selective VMO strengthening​ [21] ; hip abductor and external rotator strengthening. Electrical muscle stimulation can assist. Improve flexibility: quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, iliotibial band stretches may help. Taping techniques to correct patellar malposition.​ [22] ​ [23] Correction of training errors: in runners, more gradual distance increases, fewer hills. Decrease jumping, squats; avoid resisted leg extensions to ≥90° flexion. Patellar stabilizing brace with supporting buttress and/or straps for use with activities. Surgery (lateral release of tight retinacula, patellar tendon transfer) is rarely required and should be a last resort. |
| Lower Leg Pain (“Shin Splints,” tibial periostitis, medial tibial stress syndrome) Inflammation of the tibialis posterior at its origin or of the tibial periosteum. | History: Diffuse shin pain along the distal one-third of medial tibia, usually in inexperienced and/or inadequately stretched or strengthened athletes. Physical examination: Tenderness, usually diffuse, at medial border of tibia and adjacent muscle. If localized bony tenderness, rule out stress fracture. X-rays normal; may need bone scan to differentiate from stress fracture. Refer if: Lateral lower leg symptoms are not likely to be shin splints. Rule out possible exertional compartment syndrome. | Relative rest from aggravating activities (e.g., running/jumping/impact).​ [24] Alternative activities: cycling, rowing, swimming, skating/rollerblading, pool running. Ice/cryotherapy. NSAID s (oral or topical) for acute pain. Muscle stretching and strengthening, dynamic flexibility. Physiotherapy/massage therapy. Lower legs may be taped or sleeve used to stabilize and off-load the periosteum. Correction of predisposing anatomic factors (e.g., with foot orthotics) and training errors. Gradual return to running or activity. |
| Stress Fractures of the Tibia or Fibula Result from repetitive subthreshold loading that, over time, exceeds the bone's intrinsic ability to repair itself. | History: Well-localized shin pain with pounding/impact activities, e.g., running, jumping, marching. Early on, pain is typically mild and occurs toward the end of the inciting activity. There is often a recent change in training surface (density or topography). Night pain is a frequent complaint. Physical Examination: Point tenderness upon palpation or percussion of affected area. Loading the affected bone using specific maneuvers (such as the "hop test" or the "fulcrum test") may reproduce pain. Imaging: X-rays usually negative until at least 2 wk after onset; may see periosteal thickening. Bone scan will show discrete increased uptake at stress fracture site. CT scan or MRI can help to differentiate acute vs. healing stress fracture. Refer if: Anterior midshaft tibial stress fractures (“the dreaded black line”), which appear as a horizontal fissure extending into the cortex of the tibia on x-ray. They are slow to heal, often go on to nonunion and should be assessed by an orthopedic surgeon for possible immobilization or internal fixation. | Activity modification/restriction and rest until pain-free and nontender at site (usually 6– 12 wk). May need short-term analgesic medication, e.g., acetaminophen either alone or in a combination product containing a weak opioid ( codeine or tramadol ). Alternative low-impact activities: cycling, swimming, pool running. Removable cast brace often provides more comfort and possibly earlier return to impact activities.​ [25] Address muscle weakness/strength imbalances. Adjust for structural malalignments (e.g., lift for leg-length discrepancies) or biomechanical inefficiencies (e.g., orthotics for excessive subtalar pronation or pes cavus). Correction of training errors; avoid excessive volume or intensity or wearing worn-out running shoes. Runners should replace shoes every 500–800 km to ensure adequate midsole cushioning. Monitor for poor bone health due to hormonal, dietary or pathological causes, e.g., relative energy deficiency in sports (RED-S), osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, malignancy. Gradual/progressive return to activity when pain-free on walking and nontender at site permits progressively greater loading of the affected structure. |
| Ankle Sprain Partial or complete tear to ankle-stabilizing ligaments, most commonly lateral (anterior and posterior talofibular, calcaneofibular ligaments). Grade I: No laxity, weight bears without pain, minimal swelling Grade II: Possible slight laxity, painful weight bearing, swelling. Grade III: Significant laxity, unstable, significant swelling, complete disruption of at least 2 ligaments. | History: Acute inversion of ankle (eversion less common). Physical examination: Tenderness (most marked over injured ligament), swelling, pain with passive inversion and plantar flexion, positive anterior drawer test and talar tilt in Grade III sprains. Note: Don't forget to check for associated injury more proximally in the leg. X-rays: Clinical decision rules for the use of x-rays in acute ankle sprains are outlined in the Ottawa Ankle Rules.​ [27] Refer if: Any suspicion of fracture, high ankle sprain/syndesmotic disruption, rupture of an Achilles or peroneal tendon (which require orthopedic surgery referral). | Grade I & II Sprains Initial RICE protocol.​ [26] NSAID s (oral or topical) for acute pain and inflammation. Gradually increase weight bearing; may use tape/brace as support. Initiate weight bearing as soon as pain and stability allow to facilitate healing and proprioception.​ [26] Early ROM exercises. Stretching and strengthening: ankle dorsiflexors, plantar flexors, progress to invertors and evertors. Proprioception/balance retraining. Progressive return to activity. Grade III Sprains Initial RICE protocol, activity restriction. NSAID s for acute pain and inflammation. Removable cast brace for 3–6 wk (allows for icing, physiotherapy), then stirrup-type ankle brace and progressive physiotherapy.​ [28] Refer for orthopedic surgery consultation if not improved after 8–12 wk of conservative therapy, recurrent pain or instability. |
| Achilles Tendinitis Inflammation (tendinitis) or degeneration of the tendon's collagen in response to chronic overuse (tendinosis) of the Achilles mainly occurring at the insertion or distal aspect of tendon. | History: Pain, often swelling, of distal Achilles tendon. May be acute—usually caused by rapid increase in training/activity (e.g., running, jumping), poor flexibility/tight posterior chain, excessive pronation or poor-fitting footwear. Chronic tendinosis occurs usually in those >30 y. Sore first few steps in morning. Beware history of sudden acute pain (and occasionally feeling a “pop” or “snap”), which may indicate complete rupture of Achilles tendon. Physical examination: Occasional swelling of distal Achilles. When chronic, may have nodule/thickening of tendon with tenderness on palpation. Pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and resisted plantar flexion (especially in weight bearing, painful toe raises). May have pes planus with pronation or pes cavus. Thompson test normal if Achilles is intact (patient supine, a squeeze of calf should produce ankle plantar flexion against gravity). If there is no plantar flexion, suspect complete tear of Achilles tendon. Imaging: If concern of possible tear/rupture, ultrasound helpful. Refer if: Concern regarding complete tear, immediate orthopedic surgery referral is needed to consider surgical intervention. | Rest from aggravating activities (try biking or swimming as alternate to weight-bearing activity). Ice/cryotherapy. NSAID s (oral or topical) for initial pain and inflammation in first 4 wk of condition. Heel lift (approximately 1/4 inch) to offload Achilles. Night splint: prevents plantar flexion of ankle so Achilles tendon remains stretched while sleeping, allowing healing to take place with foot in a functional position. Control of biomechanical factors by correcting malalignment with appropriate shoes/orthotics, using appropriate training techniques and weight loss if necessary. Physiotherapy—progressive stretching and strengthening, eccentric exercise protocol is associated with a faster recovery time.​ [29] ​ [30] Extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be considered, especially with calcific tendinopathy.​ [31] ​ [32] ​ [33] Consider applying nitroglycerin transdermal patch on Achilles tendon area (one-quarter to one-half of a 0.2 mg/h patch) Q24H for 6–12 wk.​ [34] Consider referral to radiologist or sport medicine physician for sonographically guided percutaneous tenotomy/dry needling of tendinosis.​ [20] Refer to a sport medicine physician to consider PRP autologous blood injection at the site of the tendinosis; may reduce pain and improve function.​ [35] Corticosteroid injections should be avoided in both Achilles and patellar tendinopathy due to risk of tendon rupture.​ [36] Surgery rarely required for chronic Achilles tendinosis, but it is important to recognize a complete tear. |
| Plantar Fasciitis Microtears and/or thickening of the plantar fascia and inflammation of the periosteum at its calcaneal origin (heel bone). | History: Pain at plantar aspect of calcaneus, worse with first steps of the day, getting up after prolonged sitting and pain with running, jumping or prolonged walking. Physical examination: Tender at plantar fascial origin at the heel; often tight plantar fascia and gastrocnemius. X-rays: Not usually required; may show “spur” as a result of more chronic plantar fascia tightness. Refer if: Severe bruising or swelling of the heel pad, which indicates a greater concern for plantar fascia rupture or calcaneal stress fracture, requires referral to a sport medicine specialist. | Activity modification, rest from aggravating activities, e.g., bike or swim instead of run. NSAID s (oral or topical) for initial pain and acute inflammation in first 4 wk of condition. Footwear important: avoid bare feet. Wear cushioning running shoe for all weight-bearing activities. Custom foot orthotics, heel pads or gel cups may be necessary. Ice or ice massage: roll sole of foot/plantar fascia on frozen water bottle. Plantar massage: roll foot on soup can/tennis ball. Physiotherapy, including possible extracorporeal shockwave therapy.​ [37] ​ [38] Stretches: gastrocnemius, soleus, plantar fascia.​ [39] Foot intrinsics and eccentric strengthening. Night splint to prevent ankle plantar flexion while sleeping: decreases fascial shortening and morning pain.​ [40] Corticosteroid injection if not improving with conservative management (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide 20 mg mixed with 0.5 mL lidocaine 1% to tender area). Consider referral to radiologist or sport medicine physician for sonographically guided percutaneous tenotomy/dry needling. Nitroglycerin transdermal patch (one-quarter to one-half of a 0.2 mg/h patch) Q24H on point of maximum tenderness at the plantar fascia insertion into the calcaneus for 6–12 wk. Consider referral to sport medicine physician for PRP autologous blood injection at the site of the tendinosis to reduce pain and improve function.​ [41] ​ [42] ​ [43] Surgery rarely required. |
