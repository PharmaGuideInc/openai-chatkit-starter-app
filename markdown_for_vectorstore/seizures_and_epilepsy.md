### Introduction

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a predisposition to unprovoked seizures. Treatment of epilepsy entails not only prevention of seizures but also the management of biological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this disorder. This chapter focuses mainly on the role of antiseizure medications (ASMs; also known as antiepileptic drugs or AEDs) in adults with epilepsy and also outlines other important considerations in the management of this complex disease.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provides a practical definition of epilepsy as a brain disease defined by either 2 unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, 1 unprovoked seizure and a high (>60%) probability of further seizures over the next 10 years, or 1 unprovoked seizure and a clearly identifiable epilepsy syndrome (electroencephalogram [EEG] demonstrates generalized interictal epilepsy abnormalities).​[[1]](#c0016n00192) There are many seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, and the classification system for seizures and epileptic disorders can be intimidating to new learners.​[[2]](#c0016n00193)

### Goals of Therapy

- Appropriately manage patients presenting with a first seizure (see [The First Seizure](#c0016n00014) in Pharmacologic Choices)
- Prevent or minimize seizure recurrence and severity in patients with an established diagnosis of epilepsy, i.e., recurrent seizures
- Prevent or minimize adverse effects of ASMs
- Optimize quality of life, e.g., employment, psychosocial interactions, driving

### Investigations

[Figure 1](#c0016n00020) illustrates an algorithm for the management of seizures and epilepsy.

### History

- The most important factor in making a diagnosis is a detailed history of the patient’s “spells” obtained from both the patient and a witness (see [Clinical Features](#c0016n00005)).
- Determine if an aura occurs (e.g., rising abdominal sensation, sudden fear or anxiety, feeling of déjà vu). An aura indicates the onset of a focal seizure; its features may provide valuable clues to the anatomic site of the seizure onset. Lack of an aura may be due to generalized seizures or focal seizures that spread very rapidly.
- Inquire about history of recurrent or prolonged seizures in childhood, intracranial infection, head trauma, stroke, any systemic disorders that may affect the CNS, family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases.
- Establish whether a precipitant of isolated (provoked) seizure, such as use of drugs (prescribed or recreational) or alcohol; toxic or metabolic derangements caused by an acute medical illness; or an acute brain insult such as traumatic brain injury, stroke or encephalitis occurred within the last 7 days.
- For the patient with known epilepsy treated with ASMs who is presenting with a seizure recurrence, assess:

  - factors that may precipitate loss of seizure control (medication nonadherence, intercurrent illness with fever and vomiting, sleep deprivation, alcohol, nonprescription drug use, pregnancy). Note: nonadherence with ASM therapy is the most common cause of seizure breakthrough in patients with known epilepsy
  - the addition or withdrawal of a drug that may impact seizure threshold or interact with ASMs
  - sudden withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines or barbiturates

### Clinical Features

A seizure is classified as “focal” if it originates (by semiology or EEG localization) in one hemisphere of the brain and “generalized” if it appears simultaneously in both hemispheres.​[[3]](#FisherRSCrossJHFrenchJAEtAl.Operati-F6C1BA0A) See [Table 1](#0BE9E9F9) for a comparison of the most common seizure types. Since traditional terminology is still used by many practising clinicians, for the purpose of clarity, newer terminology for epileptic seizure types are provided with the traditional terms in parentheses.​[[3]](#FisherRSCrossJHFrenchJAEtAl.Operati-F6C1BA0A)

Consider whether the clinical features suggest one of the entities commonly mistaken for epileptic seizures, such as syncope or psychogenic nonepileptic spells, migraine, or transient ischemic attack (TIA).​[[4]](#c0016n00129)​[[5]](#c0016n00139)

**Table 1:** Clinical Features of Common Epileptic Seizure Types

| Seizure Type | Clinical Features |
| --- | --- |
| Focal (Partial) Seizures |  |
| Focal seizures without impairment of awareness (simple partial seizures) | Usually brief (<1 min) Motor, sensory, autonomic or cognitive features Aura may be present |
| Focal seizures with impairment of awareness (complex partial seizures) | Usual duration of 1–2 min Focally originating seizures characterized by behavioural arrest, often manifested as a blank stare Frequently accompanied by motor automatisms, e.g., lip smacking and chewing movements Aura may be present; brief postictal confusion is common Can begin without impairment of awareness before progressing or can have impairment of awareness at onset Commonly misdiagnosed as absence seizures |
| Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures)​ [3] | Begin as focal seizures but evolve to look like tonic-clonic seizures. A careful history may help identify focal features at onset (e.g., aura), thereby distinguishing them from generalized tonic-clonic seizures |
| Generalized Seizures ​ [4] ​ [5] |  |
| Absence (“petit mal”) seizures | Last only seconds (usually 5–10) No warning signs or postictal confusion Recur daily (often in clusters) in the untreated patient Onset in childhood or adolescence (almost never begin in adulthood) |
| Generalized tonic-clonic (“grand mal”) seizures | Duration of 1–2 min Fairly uniform sequence of motor features (tonic and clonic phases) Impaired consciousness, apnea and cyanosis Postictal stupor, confusion and headache |
| Atonic seizures | Abrupt loss of consciousness and muscle tone Return to awareness within seconds No other motor features Occur as part of a clinical syndrome in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy, significant intellectual disability and other seizure types Virtually never occur in otherwise intellectually and physically healthy adults |
| Myoclonic seizures | Generalized seizure type consisting of brief, bilateral “shock-like” jerks Multifocal asynchronous myoclonic jerks most commonly occur in the setting of a metabolic encephalopathy |
| Status Epilepticus |  |
|  | “Convulsive” status epilepticus (SE) was traditionally defined as recurrent primarily or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting >30 min or intermittent seizures lasting >30 min without return to baseline consciousness between events. However, almost all “isolated” tonic-clonic seizures last <2 min ;​ [6] a tonic-clonic seizure lasting >5 min most likely suggests “impending” SE and should be treated aggressively.​ [7] ​ [8] Any seizure type (absence, focal) can evolve to nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and this diagnosis should be considered in any patient with unexplained coma. Predisposing factors include subtherapeutic antiseizure medication serum levels (often related to nonadherence), drug withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines), and acute or chronic structural brain injury or tumor. |

### Physical Examination

- Look for evidence of any systemic disorder that can affect the CNS, e.g., malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorder, drug toxidromes or withdrawal syndromes
- Look for focal or lateralizing findings in the neurologic examination, e.g., hemianopia, motor weakness, hemisensory disturbance, reflex asymmetry, language dysfunction
- Assess potential injuries sustained during a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, e.g., tongue laceration, shoulder dislocation or vertebral compression fracture, burns, lacerations, contusions

### Laboratory and Diagnostic Investigations

- For the patient presenting with a *first seizure*, consider:​[[9]](#c0016n00130)

  - precipitants of isolated (provoked) seizure
    - metabolic abnormalities: CBC, glucose, electrolytes, calcium, renal and hepatic function
    - alcohol levels, toxicology screen, infection screen such as urinalysis and urine cultures (especially in elderly or developmentally challenged population)
    - chest x-ray if metastatic disease is a consideration
    - EKG to look for significant cardiac conduction abnormality
  - EEG to support the clinical impression of seizures and to determine whether the seizure is focal or primarily generalized.​[[10]](#TatumWORubboliGKaplanPWEtAl.Clinica-F6C3B0EC) The interictal EEG may show focal spikes in patients with focal seizures or generalized spike-waves in the generalized epilepsies. The EEG may also be helpful in determining the likelihood of seizure recurrence. A normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy or the possibility of future seizures
  - brain imaging to assess for a structural abnormality that could predispose a patient to seizures. An MRI is preferred and should be performed in all patients with an unprovoked seizure unless there is a clear diagnosis of a generalized epilepsy disorder such as childhood absence epilepsy or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, or known structural brain abnormality (e.g., previous stroke or major traumatic brain injury). Computed tomography (CT) of the head can be considered in the acute or urgent setting, especially if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated
  - lumbar puncture if the presenting clinical features suggest intracranial infection (meningitis, encephalitis) or a CT-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage
- For the patient with known epilepsy treated with ASMs who is presenting with a seizure recurrence, assess:

  - ASM serum levels (phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid); serum levels for other ASMs may be difficult to obtain and are of limited clinical value

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Encourage the recommended amount of sleep, as sleep deprivation can lower seizure threshold in some patients.
- Advise patients to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. Cocaine and amphetamines must be avoided because of their proconvulsant properties.
- The evidence for recreational marijuana as a “pro-” or “anti-” seizure drug is inconclusive. There is emerging evidence that formulations with high doses of cannabidiol (one of the cannabinoids found in some forms of marijuana) reduce seizure frequency in patients with severe refractory epilepsy.​[[11]](#DevinskyOMarshEFriedmanDEtAl.Cannab-45226289)​[[12]](#DevinksyOPatelADCrossJHEtAl.EffectO-94703A12)​[[13]](#StockingsEZagicDCampbellGEtAl.Evide-F6C42B55) The effects of cannabidiol on other seizure types is unknown. Health Canada approved cannabidiol oral solution (Epidiolex) in November 2023 for use as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex.
- Ask patients about their use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements. Some of these products may have proconvulsant properties or important pharmacologic interactions with ASMs.​[[14]](#c0016n00137)
- Discuss seizure precautions with patients and family members; see [General Safety Measures and Seizure Precautions](#c0016n00018).
- Certain types of diets, including the **ketogenic diet**, the **modified Atkins diet**, and the **low glycemic therapy diet** may reduce seizure frequency in some patients.​[[15]](#MartinKJacksonCFLevyRGEtAl.Ketogeni-4522FB3D)​[[16]](#SondhiVAgarwalaAPandeyRMEtAl.Effica) However, these treatments, particularly the ketogenic diet, require strict adherence to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet and are not practical for most adults with epilepsy; the modified Atkins and low glycemic therapy diet may be better tolerated. A dietician should be involved due to risk of nutritional deficiencies and interactions with ASMs.​[[17]](#KvernelandMTaubollEMolteber)
- A referral for epilepsy surgery and/or neuromodulation should be considered for patients with medically refractory epilepsy resistant to 2 or more ASMs appropriately selected and dosed.​[[18]](#c0016n00194)​[[19]](#RyvlinPRheimsSHirschLEtAl.Neuromodu-8653272A) Treatment failure does not include an ASM discontinued due to side effects.
- There is some evidence that complementary practices such as **yoga** and **mindfulness-based therapy** may be beneficial in improving quality of life, mood and possibly even seizure control in epilepsy.​[[20]](#TangVPoonWSKwanP.Mindfulness-basedT-45245F75)​[[21]](#PanebiancoMSridharanKRamaratnamS.Yo-4524821D) Other practices (meditation, relaxation training and acupuncture) have limited evidence supporting their efficacy. However, all of these practices can be considered because they may benefit the overall physical and psychological health of the patient and are usually associated with a low risk of harm.

### General Safety Measures and Seizure Precautions

- People with epilepsy are at higher risk than the general population for death from unintentional injury or poisoning and should be cautioned accordingly​[[22]](#GortonHCWebbRTCarrMJEtAl.RiskOfUnna-F6C4F7E1)
- To reduce the risk of burns during seizures:

  - discourage smoking
  - encourage patients to use microwave ovens and place pots and pans on the rear burners of stoves
- Heights and ladders should be avoided
- Power tools should not be used
- Showers are preferable to tub baths because of the risk of drowning
- Assess recreational activities as well as current and planned employment for environmental hazards should a seizure occur, and counsel accordingly
- Patients with active epilepsy who are caregivers for young children should not bathe them without assistance and should not use change tables for clothing or diaper changes
- Assess driving status; physicians should be aware of their legal obligations to local departments of transportation (mandatory vs. discretional reporting)
- Some patients may benefit from membership in an epilepsy support group

### Pharmacologic Choices

Deciding whether ASM treatment is indicated following a first seizure is an important consideration (see [The First Seizure](#c0016n00014)).

The choice of an ASM depends on the seizure type (see [Table 2](#n00225)), potential for drug interactions and side effects (see [Table 7](#c0016n00022)), desired titration speed, comorbidities (e.g., migraine, chronic pain, psychiatric disease), cost, patient preference and physician familiarity with the drug.​[[23]](#c0016n00172)​[[24]](#c0016n00173)

### Basic Principles

Basic principles for initiating ASM therapy:

- Select a single ASM based on seizure type (see [Table 2](#n00225) and [Figure 2](#First-linePharmacologicalTreatmentO-059C4D5C)).
- Start the ASM at a fraction of the usual maintenance dose (see [Table 7](#c0016n00022)) to minimize the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects unless there is a need for rapid seizure control. However, lamotrigine *always* requires slow titration to minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
- Inform patient of potential risks of treatment (especially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions). Patients of childbearing potential taking an ASM should receive a daily oral supplementation with a multivitamin containing 1 mg folic acid to prevent neural tube defects, since many pregnancies are unplanned​[[27]](#c0016n98732) (see [Prepregnancy Considerations](#c0016n00147)).
- Evaluate the patient after the usual maintenance dose has been achieved. Slowly increase the dose if seizures have recurred. Make a small dosage reduction if dose-related adverse effects are problematic (see [Table 7](#c0016n00022)).
- Add a second ASM if the maximum tolerated dose of the first ASM has failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Gradually withdraw the first ASM after the maintenance dose of the second drug has been achieved.
- Polytherapy is usually reserved for patients who have failed trials of monotherapy with 2–3 different drugs. In some cases, patients may have fewer side effects with relatively low doses of 2 concomitant ASMs.

### The First Seizure

- Whether to treat with ASMs or not after the first seizure can be a difficult decision for the patient and physician and must be individualized.​[[7]](#KrumholzAWiebeSGronsethGSEtAl.Evide-452B8416)​[[28]](#LeoneMAGiussaniGNevittSJEtAl.Immedi) Many patients will not require ASM treatment after a single seizure. The decision should be guided by a careful history to ensure there have not been prior unrecognized seizures (e.g., nocturnal or nonconvulsive seizures) and other clinical factors (e.g., abnormal neurological examination, epileptiform discharges on EEG, abnormal brain imaging, dementia). Physicians should have careful conversations with patients in whom the risks associated with recurrent seizures (e.g., driving restrictions, injury) are weighed against the risks of long-term ASM therapy.
- In most cases, there is no role for ASMs in patients with acute symptomatic (provoked) seizures, such as those provoked by metabolic derangements (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia) or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. For patients with acute traumatic brain injury, ASMs prevent seizures in the first 7 days after the injury, but have no effect on the development of later seizures. Patients with early seizures (i.e., <7 days after injury) may benefit from short-term use of ASMs, but long-term use of these medications does not prevent progression to epilepsy.​[[8]](#ScottishIntercollegiateGuidelinesNe-452DBD17)​[[29]](#SchierhoutGRobertsI.Anti-epilepticD-452CF8C4)​[[30]](#ThompsonKPohlmann-EdenBCampbellLAEt-452D3D97)

### Focal Seizures

In a large, multicentre trial comparing ASMs for patients with focal seizures, lamotrigine was better tolerated than carbamazepine and was similarly effective in obtaining long-term seizure freedom.​[[31]](#c0016n00131) The other ASMs used in the trial, gabapentin, topiramate and oxcarbazepine, were not superior to carbamazepine. A follow-up study comparing lamotrigine to other ASMs, including levetiracetam, further established lamotrigine as the first-line agent of choice for focal onset epilepsy both in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.​[[32]](#MarsonABurnsideGAppletonREtAl.TheSA)

**Levetiracetam** monotherapy was not superior to the “older” ASMs in a large, open-label study comparing levetiracetam to controlled-release carbamazepine (in patients with focal seizures).​[[33]](#c0016n00174) There is limited evidence comparing other, newer agents such as **brivaracetam**, **eslicarbazepine**, **lacosamide**, **oxcarbazepine** and **perampanel** to the older ASMs.​[[34]](#c0016n00211)​[[35]](#c0016n00212)​[[36]](#c0016n00213) However, a single large trial showed that lacosamide is noninferior to carbamazepine for use as monotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy.​[[37]](#BaulacMRosenowFToledoMEtAl.Efficacy-9D215591)

Cenobamate was approved as adjunctive therapy for managing partial-onset seizures in adults by Health Canada in June 2023.

### Generalized Seizures

A parallel trial for patients with generalized seizures showed that valproic acid was superior to lamotrigine and topiramate.​[[38]](#c0016n00132)​[[39]](#NevittSJSudellMWestonJEtAl.Antiepil-F6CD2626) Valproic acid was particularly effective in maintaining long-term seizure freedom in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. A follow-up trial, looking at a similar population, showed that levetiracetam was also inferior to valproic acid in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.​[[40]](#MarsonABurnsideGAppletonREtAl.TheSAIIVal) However, these trials were not designed to measure pregnancy outcomes, and there is evidence that among the commonly used ASMs, valproic acid may pose the highest risk to the fetus in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Most guidelines recommend that valproic acid should not be prescribed to patients of childbearing potential unless other options are either ineffective or intolerable; reasonable alternatives include levetiracetam and lamotrigine.

### Childhood Absence Epilepsy

For childhood absence epilepsy, ethosuximide and valproic acid are similarly effective in preventing seizures, and both medications are superior to lamotrigine.​[[41]](#BrigoFIgweSCLattanziSEtAl.Ethosuxim-5460B4CE) Ethosuximide is associated with lower rates of attention difficulties and fewer behavioural problems than valproic acid and is usually the drug of first choice in childhood absence epilepsy.​[[42]](#ShinnarRCShinnarSCnaanAEtAl.Pretrea-F6CDF0C6) However, ethosuximide is not effective in preventing other seizure types such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and should not be used as monotherapy in children with multiple seizure types.

### Status Epilepticus

For a summary of the management of Status Epilepticus, see [Table 3](#c0016n00226).

In patients with a history of status epilepticus or prolonged seizures, rescue medications that can be administered at home by caregivers may be prescribed in consultation with a neurologist.

### Managing the Adverse Effects of Antiseizure Medications

Many people with epilepsy will experience adverse effects related to ASM use, which can be divided into dose-related effects, idiosyncratic reactions​[[8]](#ScottishIntercollegiateGuidelinesNe-452DBD17) and long-term effects of ASM use. See [Table 4](#0852AEC3) and [Table 7](#c0016n00022) for details about common and serious adverse effects of specific ASMs.

**Table 4:** Managing Adverse Effects of Antiseizure Medications (ASMs)

| Adverse Effect | Description | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dose-related effects | The most common dose-related adverse effects from ASMs include dizziness, sedation, fatigue, ataxia, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, and nausea. | In most cases, these adverse effects can be ameliorated with a reduction in dose, if deemed to be safe in terms of seizure control. If the adverse effects are suspected to be related to the peak dose of an immediate-release medication (i.e., symptoms that occur when the serum level has peaked, usually within 30–60 min after each dose), consider slow-release formulations of ASMs (such as long-acting carbamazepine), more frequent administration with lower doses of the immediate-release ASM, or bedtime dosing of once-daily medications to minimize peak effects during waking hours. |
| Skin rash | The ASMs most likely to cause skin rash include phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine, although rash has been reported with almost every ASM.​ [45] Patients who have experienced skin rash with one ASM are much more likely to develop a skin rash with another ASM associated with high risk of rash.​ [46] Rash is most likely to occur within the first 6 wk of ASM introduction, but can occur at any time during treatment. | If a definite drug rash develops, the ASM should be stopped immediately. Continuation of ASMs after a skin rash develops can result in life-threatening reactions (see Drug-Induced Skin Reactions ) . In patients with a history of ASM-related skin rash, consider an ASM with low risk of skin rash and not chemically related to the offending agent. Introduce the ASM slowly and monitor carefully for rash. Carriers of HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 are at greater risk of CBZ-induced skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Genetic testing for HLA-B*15:02 is strongly recommended for patients with ancestry from countries with higher prevalence of allele expression (China, Thailand, Malaysia and India).​ [47] |
| Blood and/or hepatic dyscrasias | Mild elevations (<2–3 times the upper limit of normal) in liver enzymes and/or modest reductions in blood counts (e.g., neutropenia with carbamazepine, thrombocytopenia with valproic acid) are relatively common. Enzyme inducing ASMs increase the risk of hyperlipidemia.​ [48] | Obtain a baseline CBC and serum liver aminotransferases if treating with an ASM that may cause a hypersensitivity syndrome involving blood or liver; repeat in 4–6 wk. These minor changes do not require discontinuation of treatment; follow such abnormalities with serial blood tests. If CBC and liver enzymes remain stable, the frequency of repeat blood work can be gradually decreased. Yearly blood work is appropriate in stable patients. |
| Osteoporosis | Long-term use of valproic acid and enzyme-inducing ASMs (see Table 5 ) has been associated with increased risk of low bone density and fracture.​ [49] | In patients taking these medications, bone density should be monitored carefully according to osteoporosis guidelines (see Osteoporosis ), and supplementation with vitamin D and calcium should be considered. |
| Abbreviations: ASM antiseizure medication CBC complete blood count CBZ carbamazepine HLA human leukocyte antigen |

### Discontinuing Antiseizure Medications

In selected patients, after a significant duration of seizure freedom, antiseizure medication withdrawal can be considered. Withdrawal from ASMs, even after long periods of seizure freedom, can be associated with considerable risk of recurrent seizures.​[[50]](#GlossDPargeonKPackAEtAl.Antiseizure-86BCFBD7) A decision to withdraw ASMs has implications for driving, personal safety and psychological well-being. Such a decision should be made in consultation with a neurologist or epilepsy specialist.

### Managing Contraception while on Antiseizure Medications

- Review contraception (for more information, see Contraception):

  - There is an increased risk of combined oral contraceptive (COC) failure in patients taking enzyme-inducing ASMs (see [Table 5](#c0016n00224), [Table 6](#c0016n00229)). Ideally the COC should contain ≥50 mcg ethinyl estradiol; however, no COC products currently available in Canada contain >35 mcg. Some experts recommend taking 2 tablets/day of a low-dose COC to achieve 50–60 mcg ethinyl estradiol.​[[51]](#SpecialtyPharmacyServiceNHSQA.Https-54854243) In addition to hormonal methods, the use of a barrier method is recommended for increased contraceptive effect and to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections; however, barrier methods should not replace more effective methods of contraception.
  - Enzyme-inducing ASMs may also increase the risk of failure of some other contraceptive methods, including combined contraceptive patches, vaginal rings, the progestin-only oral contraceptive and some contraceptive implants (see [Table 5](#c0016n00224), [Table 6](#c0016n00229)).
  - Intrauterine devices (hormonal and nonhormonal) and progestin depot injection formulations may be reasonable alternatives for patients with epilepsy. Encourage the use of condoms with these methods to prevent sexually transmitted infections and provide a second form of contraception.
  - Lamotrigine metabolism is profoundly affected by concomitant use of COCs, which induce glucuronidation and decrease serum lamotrigine levels by at least 50%. Lamotrigine levels should be measured before and after initiation of a COC; consider doubling lamotrigine dose after starting a COC.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Because seizure disorders often affect patients during their childbearing years, it is important to consider the interaction between pregnancy/breastfeeding and the patient with epilepsy in a positive and proactive manner.​[[52]](#c0016n00143)​[[53]](#c0016n00144)​[[54]](#c0016n00145) Approximately 90% of patients with epilepsy who are seizure-free for at least 9 months prior to pregnancy will remain seizure-free during pregnancy.

### Prepregnancy Considerations

- Discuss pregnancy plans prior to conception:

  - Is ASM treatment still required? In general, if the patient is at significant risk of recurrent seizures without ASMs, especially convulsive seizures, ongoing ASM treatment would be recommended. While the risks of seizures to the fetus are not well known, they include risk of fetal hypoxia, low birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm labour and complications from a patient fall or injury. In addition, uncontrolled seizures have considerable risk to that patient.
  - ASM polytherapy that includes valproate or topiramate increases the risk of congenital malformations compared with monotherapy. Consider withdrawing the least helpful ASM if the patient is treated with ASM polytherapy. The least helpful ASM is the drug that had the smallest effect on seizure frequency when added.
  - Risk of teratogenicity is dose dependent for all ASMs, but particularly so for valproate and topiramate.
  - If possible, avoid valproic acid in patients of childbearing age, particularly those who are planning to become pregnant, due to increased risk of major congenital malformations and poor cognitive outcome. However, the risk of teratogenesis with valproic acid must be balanced against the potential risk associated with uncontrolled seizures.
  - Patients of childbearing potential who take ASMs should receive a daily oral supplementation with a multivitamin containing 1 mg folic acid, beginning at least 3 months before conception and continuing until 12 weeks’ gestational age, to potentially reduce the risk of teratogenic effects associated with ASMs.​[[27]](#c0016n98732) Higher doses (4 mg per day) are recommended in patients who have a history of neural tube defects​[[27]](#c0016n98732) and may be considered in those taking valproic acid. From 12 weeks’ gestational age, continuing through the pregnancy, and for 4–6 weeks postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues, continued daily supplementation should consist of a multivitamin with 0.4–1 mg folic acid.​[[27]](#c0016n98732)

### Choices during Pregnancy

- ASMs during pregnancy:​[[55]](#TomsonTBattinoDBromleyREtAl.Managem)

  - Over 90% of patients with epilepsy treated with ASMs have successful pregnancies and outcomes.
  - The comparative safety of different ASMs during pregnancy can be inferred from several national and international registries. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam have been studied in large numbers of pregnancies and are both associated with relatively low rates of teratogenicity. Valproic acid should be avoided, if possible, because of an increased risk of major congenital malformations and poor cognitive outcomes. Phenobarbital is associated with an increased risk of congenital cardiac malformations, and topiramate is associated with an increased risk of several malformations, including cleft lip and palate. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are also associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations.​[[56]](#AntiepilepticDrugsInPregnancyUpdate) Many other ASMs have been insufficiently studied to determine their precise risk.
  - Serial measurement of ASM levels during pregnancy should be considered when available and feasible, as they may drop significantly during pregnancy due to increased distribution, clearance and altered metabolism. If a drug level decreases by >25% compared to a prepregnancy reference level, consider a dosage adjustment. The ASMs with the most notable changes during pregnancy are discussed below.

    - Lamotrigine levels can drop by 50% or more during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and lamotrigine doses routinely need to be increased by 100% or more as a result. Consider measuring lamotrigine levels at least once a month during pregnancy and adjust dose accordingly. After delivery, the lamotrigine level will rise quickly within the first 1–2 weeks, and the dose will have to be adjusted early after delivery to avoid toxicity.
    - Levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and lacosamide levels can also drop during pregnancy, and monitoring of levels should be considered, especially in patients with a high risk of seizures related to minor changes in serum levels.​[[57]](#PennellPBKaranamAMeadorKJEtAl.Antis-86BDE3EB)
  - Do not switch ASMs during pregnancy to avoid teratogenesis. The risk of major congenital malformations is highest in the first trimester before many patients have discovered that they are pregnant. A change of ASM therapy during pregnancy exposes the fetus to risks associated with polytherapy and exposes the patient to the risks of serious adverse effects (including hypersensitivity reaction) and uncontrolled seizures and/or status epilepticus.
- Obtain expert obstetrical advice on timing and type of ultrasound to screen for fetal malformations.
- During the first weeks postdelivery, follow ASM levels closely as they may rise precipitously if the dose has not been reduced to the prepregnancy dose. Follow ASM levels closely and slowly titrate back to prepregnancy dose based on results. A slightly higher dose may be considered during the first 3 months of the postpartum period due to sleep deprivation and other stressors.

### Choices during Breastfeeding

- Breastfeeding should not be discouraged. Although many ASMs transfer into breast milk, their concentrations are significantly lower than maternal serum concentrations, and the clinical significance of exposure is unknown.​[[58]](#BirnbaumAKMeadorKJKaranamAEtAl.Anti) Several studies suggest that the advantages of breastfeeding likely outweigh the potential risks of ASM exposure in children of patients with epilepsy.​[[59]](#MeadorKJBakerGABrowningNEtAl.Breast-F72DC537)​[[60]](#VeibyGEngelsenBAGilhusNE.EarlyChild-F72DE944)
- In patients who are taking barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide or lamotrigine, infants may be sedated; infants exposed to barbiturates and benzodiazepines in utero who are not breastfed may have withdrawal symptoms in the first week after delivery.​[[61]](#StephenLJHardenCTomsonTEtAl.Managem-54629396) In selected cases, regular monitoring of clinical signs (e.g., lethargy, poor feeding, sedation) and of drug concentrations in breast milk and/or in the infant’s plasma may guide breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Do not rely on serum ASM levels alone to guide therapy.​[[62]](#Aicua-RapunIAndrePRossettiAOEtAl) Some patients will have satisfactory seizure control at low ASM levels, while others will have dose-related toxicity with ASM levels in the “therapeutic” range. Obtain a serum ASM level when the patient is seizure-free and has no dose-related toxicity; this ASM level may serve as a reference point for the future if seizures or drug toxicity occur. A useful adage is “treat the patient, not the serum level.”
- With many ASMs, drug interactions are potential problems. Drugs with hepatic enzyme–inducing properties (see [Table 5](#c0016n00224)) may reduce the levels of concomitant medications. Consider the presence (or absence) of other medications when selecting an ASM.
- Studies suggest that switching between brand and generic formulations or between different generic formulations will likely not harm the majority of low-risk patients.​[[63]](#PriviteraMDWeltyTEGidalBEEtAl.Gener-458FA4CD)​[[64]](#KesselheimASStedmanMRBubrickEJEtAl.-458FE4E4) Some patients may, however, be sensitive to even minor changes in ASM dosing and thus caution should be used.​[[8]](#ScottishIntercollegiateGuidelinesNe-452DBD17)
- It is reasonable to refer any patient with uncontrolled seizures despite adequate trials of 2–3 ASMs to a tertiary-care epilepsy centre for further evaluation.
