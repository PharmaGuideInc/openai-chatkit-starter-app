### Goals of Therapy

This chapter summarizes the nonsurgical management of low back pain.

### Acute Low Back Pain

- Promote rapid/earlier recovery and reduce distress

### Subacute/Recurrent Low Back Pain

- Prevent chronicity through proper assessment and management
- Prevent or minimize work absence

### Chronic Low Back Pain

- Promote or restore healthy behaviour, fitness and appropriate role functions by defining and treating medical and psychological factors associated with persistent/recurrent pain, according to evidence-based principles

### Investigations

### Initial Assessment

Acute low back pain is defined as occurring within 0–30 days of onset. Subacute low back pain is defined as persisting for 4–12 weeks post onset while recurrent low back pain is defined as occurring up to 6 months after onset. Sciatica refers to pain originating in the back and referred below the level of the knee. There are two subsets: sciatica with radiculopathy (demonstrable on neurologic exam, electromyogram, CT or MRI) and sciatica without radiculopathy, likely due to a referred pain mechanism.

The Clinically Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) back tool (see [Figure 1](#COREbacktool)) has been developed to guide clinicians through the assessment and management of patients with back pain and to triage patients to appropriate specialist intervention when needed.

A detailed clinical history and physical exam can help determine the cause of low back pain and identify any “red flags” (see [Table 1](#c0055n00010)), which when present indicate further investigation and/or referral for consultation are indicated.​[[1]](#c0055n00297)​[[2]](#c0055n00298)​[[3]](#c0055n00300)​[[4]](#c0055n00299)​[[5]](#c0055n00033) A large retrospective study assessing the predictive accuracy of common red flags in patients presenting with low back pain found that the presence of red flags only modestly increased the likelihood of a serious diagnosis.​[[6]](#Premkumar2018) Additionally, the absence of red flags did not strongly predict the absence of serious diagnosis. Certain combinations of red flags significantly increased the likelihood of a serious diagnosis. A combination of age >50 years and history of trauma significantly increased the likelihood of fracture and a combination of history of cancer and unexplained weight loss increased the likelihood of spinal malignancy. Similarly a combination of fever, chills or sweating with history of infection strongly increased the probability of an infection. However, the combination of red flags decreased the sensitivity. A thorough clinical history, relevant physical examination and neurologic assessment as well as the use of clinical judgment are therefore essential when evaluating a patient with low back pain.

Initial work up should also consider common conditions (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, lumbo-pelvic pain syndromes).

**Table 1:** “Red Flag” Symptoms/Signs in Assessment of Low Back Pain

| Condition | Red Flags in Patient with Low Back Pain​[a] | Investigations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cancer | Age >50 ; previous cancer history; unexplained weight loss; failure to improve after 1 month of treatment​ [2] | Positive laboratory tests (including elevated ESR, reduced hematocrit)​ [2] and imaging showing erosion or blastic lesions |
| Cauda equina syndrome | Acute urinary retention or overflow incontinence; loss of anal sphincter tone/fecal incontinence; perineal numbness; change in sexual function; weakness of legs​ [1] | Emergency neurological assessment and MRI of lumbosacral spine |
| Epidural abscess | Intravenous drug abuse or sources of infection; local or radicular pain unrelieved by position change; fever, sensory loss, paraparesis or quadriparesis, bowel/bladder impairment | Emergency neurological examination, positive laboratory tests for source of infection; MRI of spinal cord, urine drug screen |
| Herniated nucleus pulposus | Positive SLR (leg pain at <60°) ; weak dorsiflexion of ankle (L4-5) or great toe (L5-S1 or L4-5); reduced ankle reflex (L5-S1); reduced light touch in L4, L5 or S1 dermatomes of foot/leg​ [1] | MRI of lumbar spine |
| Spinal fracture or compression fracture | Age >50 , female gender, major trauma, pain and tenderness, and a distracting painful injury;​ [4] also consider a history of osteoporosis or corticosteroid use | Plain x-rays of the spine |
| Spinal osteomyelitis | Intravenous drug abuse; sources of infection (e.g., skin, teeth, urinary tract or indwelling catheter); fever; vertebral tenderness​ [3] | Positive laboratory tests for source of infection; urine drug screen, MRI of spine |

[a] A combination of two red flags or more increase the likelihood of a serious diagnosis.

**Table 2:** Yellow Flags (Psychological Risk Factors and Predictors of Chronicity)

| Risk Factors for Chronicity | Mental Status Indicators of Significant Anxiety or Depression |
| --- | --- |
| Duration of work absence High levels of self-reported functional disability Self-report of extreme pain and constant pain in multiple body areas History of prolonged sick-listing after previous injuries Prior history of absenteeism Delays/obstacles in work re-entry process Patients who believe that they will never return to work Adversarial attitude toward employer Long-standing history of psychiatric distress or maladjustment | Insomnia or nightmares Irritability Social withdrawal Panic episodes or anxiety during the day or night Persistent tearfulness Poor concentration Inability to enjoy (anhedonia) Poor appetite/weight loss Poor libido Thoughts that “life is not worth living” |

For recurrent back pain or persistent back pain of 3–6 months, reassessment is advised and should include reevaluation for yellow flags (see [Table 2](#c0055n10010)).​[[5]](#c0055n00033)​[[7]](#c0055n00039) Although compensation or litigation alone has an indefinite effect on prognosis, where compensation levels are high or when the employee is in conflict, compensation and litigation may significantly impair prognosis.​[[7]](#c0055n00039) Additional predictors of chronicity (significant pain >3 months) include depression and the patients’ perceived risk of their pain becoming chronic.​[[8]](#Traegar2016)

### Physical Examination

The following physical exams are recommended:​[[9]](#wellhealth)

- Observe the gait, heel (L4–5) and toe walking (S1), Trendelenburg gait pattern (L5)
- Standing:
  - perform modified Schöber
  - examine trunk lateral bending and spine extension
- Sitting:
  - examine patellar reflex and quadriceps power (L3-4)
  - test ankle dorsiflexion power (L4-5) and ankle flexion power (S1), and wasting if present
  - examine great toe extension (L5) and flexion power (S1)
  - perform a Slump test (referred pain to buttock and back on the affected side) and check for consistency with a supine straight leg raise (SLR) test
  - perform a FABER test
- Lying:
  - while patient is in a prone position, examine femoral nerve stretch (L3-4) and saddle sensation testing (S2-4)
- Sensation:
  - examine dermatome sensation with light touch and paperclip or pin (L3-S2)
  - look for generalized diffuse tenderness, upper and lower body and right and left side, trunk and limbs
  - if symptoms warrant, look for peripheral sensation abnormalities (e.g., entrapment, polyneuropathy)

### Diagnostic Imaging

Decision to order diagnostic imaging depends on presence of red flags (see [Table 1](#c0055n00010)). For uncomplicated low back pain (acute, subacute or chronic) or for chronic radiculopathy with no red flags, diagnostic imaging is not recommended.​[[10]](#ACRimaging)​[[11]](#Chou2009) Patients without low back pain often show anatomic abnormalities on imaging.​[[12]](#Jensen1994) Additionally, in the absence of red flags, routine imaging has poor prognostic value and is associated with increased risk of surgery.​[[13]](#Srinivas2012)

MRI or CT with contrast and other imaging modalities are indicated in the presence of risk factors (e.g., low velocity trauma, osteoporosis, elderly patient, chronic steroid use, suspicion of cancer, infection or immunosuppression). Additionally, imaging may be warranted in surgery candidates with persistent or progressive symptoms during or following 6 weeks of conservative management in patients who have new or progressive symptoms or clinical findings, with history of prior lumbar surgery, or with suspected cauda equina syndrome or rapidly progressive neurologic deficit.​[[10]](#ACRimaging)

### Acute Low Back Pain

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Patients with low back pain with or without sciatica should be informed on the nature of low back pain and reassured of the low likelihood of a serious underlying condition.​[[14]](#Traeger2017) Patients should also be educated about the self-limiting nature of low-back pain.​[[15]](#NICEguidance)

For acute or recurrent back pain with or without sciatica of <30 days, provide symptomatic relief, encourage the patient to continue or resume activity and work as soon as tolerated. Avoid unnecessary bedrest for uncomplicated back pain as well as premature physical therapy. This approach results in the shortest duration of sick leave and pain and some improvement in ability to perform daily activity.​[[5]](#c0055n00033)​[[16]](#c0055n00323)​[[17]](#c0055n00035)​[[18]](#c0055n00036) For acute low back pain, bedrest is not supported by evidence. Nonpharmacologic options are favoured, including exercise.​[[19]](#Qaseem2017)​[[15]](#NICEguidance)

Spinal manipulative therapy may have modest effects on pain and disability in acute low back pain.​[[20]](#Paige2017) It is best to combine manual therapy with other treatment modalities, e.g., exercise, psychological interventions.​[[15]](#NICEguidance)

Although often used, especially by allied health professionals treating low back pain, the evidence for acupuncture efficacy is weak and contradictory.​[[21]](#c0055n00380)​[[22]](#c0055n00381)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of acute low back pain are presented in [Table 3](#c0055n00030). Note that pharmacologic management options used for low back pain may also be used for neck pain. Refer to Neck Pain and Whiplash for further discussion if a patient has coexisting neck pain.

There is evidence that acetaminophen is not effective for reducing pain intensity and disability, or improving quality of life in short-term low back pain.​[[23]](#refitem-1222114-4DDA8B25) However, given the greater safety profile compared to NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, a trial of acetaminophen (e.g., 500 mg Q4H) is a reasonable option in acute uncomplicated back pain.

For acute uncomplicated low back pain, NSAIDs are effective for pain relief, particularly during the first few weeks, but there is no evidence that one NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) is more effective than another.​[[24]](#c0055n00161) Celecoxib shows fewer GI side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs, and several NSAIDs (both COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs) have been associated with increased cardiovascular risks in certain patient populations.​[[25]](#c0055n00335) Cardiovascular risk is greater with celecoxib, diclofenac and high-dose ibuprofen.​[[26]](#c0055n00382) Therefore, when selecting an NSAID, consider tolerability, patient contraindications (risk of GI or cardiovascular adverse events, other contraindications to use) and cost. For more information on risks associated with NSAIDs therapy, Osteoarthritis.

In patients with nonradicular, nontraumatic acute low back pain, naproxen alone was as effective as naproxen in combination with methocarbamol, orphenadrine, acetaminophen and oxycodone or with cyclobenzaprine in reducing pain and improving function.​[[27]](#Friedman2015)​[[28]](#Friedman2018) Adding any of these agents to naproxen significantly increased the risk of adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, dyspepsia and nausea.

During the acute phase of low back pain, there is contradictory evidence that **muscle relaxants** may be effective for relief of pain and spasm during short-term use, but are more likely to cause adverse effects such as drowsiness and dizziness.​[[5]](#c0055n00033)​[[27]](#Friedman2015)​[[28]](#Friedman2018)​[[29]](#c0055n00114)​[[30]](#refitem-1222116-4DE2AFB9) Muscle relaxants might include **benzodiazepines**, cyclobenzaprine, nonprescription preparations containing methocarbamol or orphenadrine, or the antispasticity drugs baclofen or tizanidine.

Early use of opioids does not offer advantages in disability outcome; thus, nonopioid options are preferable early on. A prospective study of patients with low back pain found slightly greater propensity for disability at 6 months for those taking opioids compared to those not taking opioids.​[[31]](#c0055n00383)

Not all types of back pain have the same mechanism. In soft tissue and hyperalgesic pain, agents with a central mechanism of action are preferred, e.g., baclofen, buprenorphine, GABA derivatives, tramadol. In prostaglandin-mediated pain, NSAIDs are preferred. When pain is severe and not responsive to other appropriate measures, opioids may be considered, beginning with low doses for a brief period of 3–5 days followed by review.​[[32]](#refitem-1222118-4DE3477A)

### Subacute and Recurrent Low Back Pain

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

If the pain and work absences are not resolved by the end of the 1​st month, early active treatment (individual patient education, workplace visit and planned work re-entry) aimed at return to productive function has the greatest efficacy with regard to resolving pain, restoring functional ability and successful work return.​[[33]](#c0055n00040)​[[34]](#c0055n00160)​[[35]](#c0055n00159) Setting a treatment timeline and projected date for return to work is essential for management. Return to work programs that include activity in the workplace increase success.​[[7]](#c0055n00039)​[[34]](#c0055n00160)​[[35]](#c0055n00159) The active ingredient in successful work return, however, appears to be timely workplace intervention including all the stakeholders rather than clinic treatment modalities and, if possible, to avoid the patient having to cease work for treatment.​[[17]](#c0055n00035)​[[18]](#c0055n00036)​[[34]](#c0055n00160)​[[35]](#c0055n00159)

Patient education at this stage should stress that low back pain usually has a favourable outcome if it is managed by active exercise and timely return to function and occupation, rather than expecting the pain to completely resolve first. Focus individual education on staying active and returning to normal activities, avoiding worry, and learning coping skills and ways to avoid strain and back injuries. Screen for and treat psychosocial factors or refer when necessary.​[[7]](#c0055n00039)

There are many potential modalities of symptomatic physical therapy, e.g., ice, heat, laser, ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Evidence for efficacy of any individual modality is presently inadequate, with the exception that active exercise and avoidance of unnecessary bedrest improve outcomes.​[[16]](#c0055n00323)​[[17]](#c0055n00035) Combining modalities (e.g., massage plus exercise, or manipulation plus exercise) is more effective than single-modality treatment.​[[36]](#c0055n00322)​[[37]](#c0055n00324)

At approximately 3–6 months, the focus is on interrupting progress toward chronic pain. If there is marked functional disability associated with pain that is recurrent or persisting for 3 months or more, establish a coordinated program among the primary care provider, patient, employer and compensation agency. If the coordinated program is unsuccessful, identify possible psychological comorbidity and consider timely referral to a multidisciplinary chronic pain management clinic for intensive treatment.​[[5]](#c0055n00033)​[[7]](#c0055n00039)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of subacute and recurrent low back pain are presented in [Table 3](#c0055n00030). Note that pharmacologic management options used for low back pain may also be used for neck pain. Refer to Neck Pain and Whiplash for further discussion if a patient has coexisting neck pain.

. . . . .

### Chronic Low Back Pain

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic therapy is most effective with a combination of 2 or more modalities,​[[5]](#c0055n00033)​[[7]](#c0055n00039)​[[15]](#NICEguidance) including:

- Active exercise
- “Back school” or patient education
- Functional restoration
- Physical conditioning programs​[[38]](#c0055n00118)
- Yoga (contradictory evidence)​[[39]](#c0055n00384)​[[40]](#Wieland2017)
- Multidisciplinary rehabilitation​[[41]](#c0055n00385)​[[42]](#Kamper2015)
- Relaxation therapy
- Cognitive and behavioural therapy ​[[43]](#c0055n00386)​[[44]](#Cherkin2016)
- Psychosocial intervention and training in coping skills
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction​[[44]](#Cherkin2016)

For chronic low back pain, the goal of therapy is to regain function, which often translates into work re-entry. Efficacy for work return as a specific outcome is associated with conducting therapy if possible in the work setting or workplace visits, in the context of a planned work re-entry.​[[35]](#c0055n00159) When combined in a multimodal package, nonpharmacologic options such as patient education, cognitive behavioural therapy and relaxation therapy are more effective for chronic low back pain if conducted in the context of workplace and work re-entry.​[[34]](#c0055n00160)​[[35]](#c0055n00159) Additionally, patients must be engaged in goal-setting and monitoring progress for optimal outcomes.​[[7]](#c0055n00039) For low back pain management resources and links, see: [www.thewellhealth.ca/low-back-pain](https://thewellhealth.ca/low-back-pain/).

There is a lack of evidence regarding whether patients who have failed treatment in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program (or chronic pain management program) will benefit from a 2​nd attempt. After treatment failure, identify and address barriers that interfered with progress. These might include a psychiatric disorder (especially major depression, anxiety disorder or dysthymia), an attitudinal problem such as unwillingness to set goals for change, a substance or medication abuse problem, a previously undetected medical/surgical problem or obstacles to work re-entry within the job environment.

In patients with chronic low back pain, prescribed walking programs have been shown to be as effective as usual nonpharmacologic methods such as physical therapy, group exercise classes, or strength training for improving pain, functioning, and quality of life. Providing patients with a pedometer, walking diary and instructions for a tailored, graduated, walking program (building up to 30 minutes of brisk walking 5 days a week) is a beneficial and cost-effective option for managing chronic low back pain.​[[45]](#refitem-1172129-BFC791D1)​[[46]](#refitem-1172130-BFC7937F) Moderate-quality evidence suggests that motor control exercises (core strengthening) are better than minimal interventions for chronic low back pain, but not superior to other forms of exercise.​[[47]](#Saragiotto2016)

For chronic low back pain, there is anecdotal but insufficient clinical trial evidence to recommend therapeutic ultrasound,​[[48]](#c0055n00387) insoles,​[[49]](#c0055n00330) lumbar supports,​[[50]](#c0055n00332), prolotherapy​[[51]](#c0055n00331) or manual material handling intervention and assistive devices for preventing and treating back pain in workers.​[[52]](#c0055n00329) Imaging guided radiofrequency facet rhizotomy, which interrupts the nerve root, can be considered for intractable facet-mediated back pain.​[[63]](#refitem-1222149-579B1F7B) For acupuncture alone or combined with other therapies for chronic back pain, there is limited evidence of short-term relief of pain and functional impairment.​[[53]](#c0055n00119)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of chronic low back pain are presented in [Table 3](#c0055n00030). Note that pharmacologic management options used for low back pain may also be used for neck pain. Refer to Neck Pain and Whiplash for further discussion if a patient has coexisting neck pain.

Despite widespread use of many medications for the treatment of chronic low back pain, there is a lack of high-quality evidence. There is some support for the use of NSAIDs for chronic low back pain.​[[54]](#c0055n00388)​[[55]](#Enthoven2016)

Efficacy of antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants) has not been demonstrated for relief of chronic low back pain.​[[56]](#c0055n00163) Nevertheless, chronic pain is often associated with comorbidities. When major depression or anxiety disorders are comorbid with chronic pain, psychotropic medications may be indicated for proper treatment, even though the pain itself will not necessarily be improved by these medications. Duloxetine is the only antidepressant approved for use in chronic low back pain but its place in therapy is undetermined. It may be a cost-effective option in the elderly, who are at an increased risk of GI and CV complications due to NSAIDs.​[[57]](#c0055n00389)

Adequate evidence for muscle relaxants for chronic back pain is lacking.​[[30]](#refitem-1222116-4DE2AFB9)​[[54]](#c0055n00388) Although there is no quality evidence, there is some clinical experience that the GABA derivatives gabapentin or pregabalin may sometimes be helpful for chronic low back pain associated with pain/tenderness in multiple areas.​[[58]](#Shanthanna2017)

There is limited evidence that tramadol with or without acetaminophen is more effective than placebo for uncomplicated chronic back pain.​[[59]](#c0055n00162)

Opioids may only provide modest short-term pain relief in patients with chronic low back pain and are not well tolerated. However, they may be used in patients who do not have contraindications for their use and have persistent low back pain that is not responsive to nonopioid analgesics.​[[54]](#c0055n00388)​[[60]](#AbdelShaheed2016) Physicians may prefer acetaminophen/​codeine over other opioids because of concerns about misuse; however, codeine can also be misused, acetaminophen has a toxic effect on the liver with excessive use, and a significant minority of patients do not have effective analgesia from codeine due to impaired CYP2D6 function.​[[61]](#c0055n00390) If used, acetaminophen with codeine should be only one part of a more comprehensive treatment plan.

If opioids are to be used, they should be in small doses less than 50 mg morphine equivalent (MEQ) per day and initially no more than 3–5 days. Buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist-antagonist, in transdermal patch is useful in chronic back pain when there is significant central sensitization or myofascial pain. It is also well tolerated in the elderly and in cases of renal impairment, but approximately 20% of patients develop contact dermatitis under the transdermal patch.​[[62]](#c0055n00395)

When considering opioid analgesics, discuss and agree on a tapering strategy prior to commencing treatment. Doses higher than 90 mg MEQ per day are not recommended. Opioids should not be considered in the presence of significant depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or a history of substance misuse/dependency. When prescribing opioids or other controlled substances, screen patients for risks of potential drug abuse and prescribe with appropriate precautions and follow-up. For more information on prescribing opioids for patients with non-cancer chronic pain according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines, consult the Opioid Manager section of www.thewellhealth.ca.

Injection therapies for chronic low back pain, e.g., trigger point blocks with **local anesthetics** or **epidural steroids**, have not had statistically significant efficacy with regard to pain relief and work disability;​[[64]](#c0055n00164)​[[65]](#c0055n00392) however, there is a tendency toward positive results with only minor side effects. Studies of facet joint injections with corticosteroid, with or without local anesthetic, have found conflicting evidence for relief compared to placebo.​[[64]](#c0055n00164) Imaging guided radiofrequency facet rhizotomy, can be considered for intractable facet-mediated back pain.​[[64]](#c0055n00164) There is limited evidence for efficacy of trigger point blocks for short-term relief. Injection therapy may be attempted in patients with low back pain, provided injections are well tolerated and accompanied by patient improvement for an adequate duration. Injection therapy should be accompanied by other proven rehabilitation therapies.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Management during Pregnancy

More than 50% of pregnant women will experience back pain during pregnancy, usually in the lumbar and sacroiliac areas. Low back pain in pregnancy is more likely if there is a previous history of low back pain or being overweight. Contributing factors include hormonal changes, anterior displacement of the centre of gravity (which accentuates lumbar lordosis) and weight gain during pregnancy. Spondylolysis or the progression of spondylolisthesis may occur. There is a small risk of disk herniation during pregnancy; if imaging is necessary, noncontrast MRI could be performed.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Since the majority of treatments for back pain are nonpharmacologic, most of the recommendations remain applicable to the expectant mother. Ideally, a woman planning a pregnancy should address problems of weight and core fitness before conception. During pregnancy, a program of walking and modified exercise is recommended to strengthen abdominal and back muscles. Advice on exercise and body mechanics should be modified to be consistent with the stage of pregnancy.

Evidence suggests benefits from exercise, education, water-based exercise, multimodal physical therapies including manual therapy, and acupuncture.​[[66]](#c0055n00393)​[[67]](#c0055n00243) However, the evidence for these treatments is limited in quantity and quality.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be used over a limb during pregnancy but not over the low back or abdomen due to the possibility of precipitation of labour.

### Pharmacologic Choices

If nonpharmacologic options are insufficient to manage back pain and drug treatment is deemed necessary, the following information may serve as a guide in making an informed decision.

Acetaminophen in therapeutic doses is an appropriate choice for analgesia in the pregnant woman. Avoid use of topical diclofenac that is formulated in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle, as the vehicle's safety in pregnancy is unknown. Short-term use of NSAIDs in the 1​st or 2​nd trimester may be considered. Third-trimester use of NSAIDs should be avoided due to increased risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and neonatal pulmonary hypertension.​[[68]](#c0055n00244) On October 30, 2020, Health Canada started investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant women 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[[69]](#HCNSAIDsPregnancy) This investigation is in response to a U.S. FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[[70]](#FDANSAIDs2020) Ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid may be considered if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected.

Where possible, avoid the use of opioids during pregnancy; if not feasible, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible time, as high doses and use near term may result in adverse neonatal effects (opioid withdrawal syndrome, respiratory depression). Weaning from chronic opioid therapy, where feasible, should begin in the 2​nd trimester to reduce the risk of spontaneous abortion or preterm labour. Dose reductions of no more than 10% of the total dose per week are suggested.​[[71]](#c0055n00245) The last 30% of dose reduction may require slower tapering, e.g., reducing by 5% of the total dose per week. Small amounts of immediate-release opioid may be required to treat transient symptoms of withdrawal during the final week of weaning.

Neonatal withdrawal has also been reported after long-term tramadol treatment in the pregnant mother.​[[72]](#c0055n00246)​[[73]](#c0055n00247)

**Tricyclic antidepressants** are considered relatively safe in pregnancy,​[[68]](#c0055n00244) but should generally not be used to treat chronic low back (or neck pain) during pregnancy as evidence regarding their efficacy is lacking.

Avoid use of muscle relaxants (e.g., baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, orphenadrine), as there are insufficient data on their safe use during pregnancy. There is a possible risk of congenital malformations with diazepam use, and extended use in the pregnant mother has been associated with adverse effects in the neonate such as drug withdrawal and floppy infant syndrome.​[[68]](#c0055n00244)

Insufficient data are available regarding the safe use of gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) during pregnancy.

Lidocaine or bupivacaine may be used to inject trigger points for pain control. In pregnancy, the doses should be low, and lidocaine or bupivacaine should be avoided in the presence of fetal distress or anoxia—conditions that might occur during delivery.​[[74]](#c0055n00333)​[[75]](#c0055n00334) **Normal saline** may be used for injection of trigger points as an alternative to lidocaine or other local anesthetics.

### Management during Breastfeeding

In the postpartum and breastfeeding period, about one-third of women will continue to experience low back pain. Risk factors include the weight gained during pregnancy, lifting and carrying the infant, and the ergonomics of how the mother carries and tends the infant.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

During the postpartum period, the mother should continue a program of walking and modified exercise to strengthen abdominal and back muscles. It is also important to institute appropriate diet and weight loss and to focus on good body mechanics when carrying and caring for the baby.

There is no contraindication to the use of TENS in the breastfeeding mother except while the infant is actually nursing.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Acetaminophen in therapeutic doses is an appropriate choice for analgesia in the breastfeeding mother. Ibuprofen has also been used safely during breastfeeding. Short-term use of most other NSAIDs is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding;​[[76]](#c0055n00248) choose agents with shorter half-lives where possible.

For most opioid analgesics, the amount of drug transferred into breast milk is small. However, due to the serious nature of opioid adverse events, opioid use ​during lactation should be done with caution and be limited in duration (2–3 days). Breastfeeding mothers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of opioid toxicity for themselves (constipation, oversedation) and their babies (drowsiness or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, decreased muscular tone). Mothers should stop breastfeeding if they develop signs of toxicity.​[[77]](#Anderson2016) ​[[78]](#Ito2018)

Health Canada and the US FDA advise against the use of codeine during breastfeeding unless the benefits outweigh the risks.​[[79]](#HCcodeine2008)​[[80]](#FDAcodeine2018) Controversy exists in the interpretation of the case report that was one of the bases of the recommendation.​[[81]](#Zipursky2020)​[[82]](#Pimlott2020) Until the controversy is resolved, it may be reasonable to limit use of codeine in breastfeeding mothers.

Small amounts of tramadol and its metabolites are transferred into breast milk, but published data of the effects on infants are lacking.​[[83]](#c0055n00251) Tramadol also has a long half-life (7 hours for tramadol and 8.5 hours for the active metabolite in newborns), which may be a concern.

**Tricyclic antidepressants** can cause sedation in the newborn if used in the antenatal period or during breastfeeding.​[[76]](#c0055n00248)

Diazepam accumulates in the newborn during breastfeeding and is associated with a risk of adverse effects in the infant.​[[68]](#c0055n00244) There is no published information on the effects of most other nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxants on the breastfed infant.

Limited data indicate that low levels of gabapentin appear in infant serum, but no apparent adverse effects to the baby have been reported.​[[84]](#c0055n00252)

### General Considerations

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- A significant minority of chronic pain sufferers have comorbid depression, anxiety or dysthymia (chronic depression/anxiety), often masked by the pain presentation. Key symptoms or yellow flags (see [Table 2](#c0055n10010)) can reveal an underlying mood disorder. Comorbid mood disorders often respond to antidepressants, which can improve coping with pain.
- For back pain and chronic soft tissue pain, tricyclic or other types of antidepressants have equivocal efficacy, but may be useful for their antidepressant effect.​[[7]](#c0055n00039)
- Some patients with back pain who have difficulty sleeping may benefit from a caffeine-free analgesic product.
