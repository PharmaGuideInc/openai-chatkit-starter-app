### Introduction

The occurrence of a first transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke increases the risk of experiencing a second ischemic event. Patients experiencing a TIA or mild stroke (without disabling deficits) may derive the most long-term benefit from full investigation and treatment. Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke is the main subject of this chapter. Primary prevention of stroke is covered in detail elsewhere (see Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease).

The short-term prognosis after a first TIA is worse for patients with certain characteristics and symptoms; in these individuals, the incidence of stroke within 2 days of TIA is around 8%.​[[1]](#c0023n00024) Adverse prognostic indicators include >60 years of age, blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, diabetes mellitus, speech and/or motor symptoms, and duration of symptoms >10 minutes. Accordingly, these higher-risk patients should be promptly investigated and treated, ideally the same day, especially if the symptoms occurred in the past 48 hours.​[[2]](#c0023n00036) An evaluation by a physician with stroke expertise is recommended. Studies have reported a substantial reduction in risk associated with optimal urgent management.​[[3]](#AmarencoPLavallxe9ePCLabreucheJEtAl-66846A19)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent disabling neurologic deficits (stroke) and recurrent TIA
- Prevent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular mortality

### Investigations

- Complete history with attention to:

  - nature, frequency, duration and distribution of symptoms (cerebral localization)
  - identification of vascular risk factors
  - in younger patients, attention to other potential etiological factors (trauma, cardiac abnormalities, infection, coagulation disorders, drugs)
- Physical examination:

  - complete neurologic assessment
  - visual assessment including eye movements, visual fields, acuity and funduscopy
  - complete vascular examination including auscultation (cranium, neck, cardiac), palpation (temporal artery, peripheral pulses) and blood pressure in both arms
- Laboratory tests—indicated in most patients with TIAs or mild strokes:

  - CT scan of brain (to exclude a hemorrhagic process and/or TIA mimics) and CT angiography (arch to vertex). Cervical duplex ultrasonography is acceptable as an alternative to CT angiography in some patients
  - CBC, coagulation parameters, blood glucose, renal, lipid and hepatic enzyme profile
  - in select patients (young patients or older patients with possible arteritis), more specialized blood tests may be indicated, e.g., ESR, immunologic work-up, hypercoagulable screen, antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteine
  - baseline ECG (exclude atrial fibrillation or other contributing arrhythmia)
  - other cardiac tests (e.g., transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, 24–48 hour Holter monitoring) may be indicated (usually have a higher yield in patients with established cardiac disease or in older patients); in selected cases, a 30-day period of cardiac monitoring using a loop recorder may be indicated.​[[4]](#GladstoneDJSpringMDorianPEtAl.Atria-9C257CDA) In younger patients (<60 y) without a determined etiology (cryptogenic stroke), performance of a transesophageal echocardiography should be considered to exclude a patent foramen ovale​[[2]](#c0023n00036)
  - MRI, MR angiography (MRA) may be required to confirm the degree of arterial occlusion and/or exclude other neurologic conditions mimicking cerebral ischemia; cerebral angiography may be required in select patients to confirm a vasculopathy (moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia) or vasculitis

### Therapeutic Choices

Therapeutic options for preventing the recurrence of ischemic stroke are summarized in [Figure 1](#c0023n00005).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Encourage smoking cessation (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation).
- Advise patient to control vascular risk factors through weight reduction, diet modification (reducing alcohol, fat and salt consumption), exercise​[[5]](#Dx2019IsabellaNTShkredovaDARichards-66970DB4) and diabetes management, if required (see Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity).
- Recommend rehabilitative therapy (physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy) within 24–48 hours if there are residual neurologic deficits.
- In selected patients with a documented patent foramen ovale (PFO) on echocardiography and no other specific etiology for their stroke (cryptogenic), consider a cardiology referral to assess for closure of the PFO.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[6]](#NtaiosGPapavasileiouVSagrisDEtAl.Cl-6697F1D5)​[[7]](#KuijpersTSpencerFASiemieniukRACEtAl-668AB497)

### Carotid Endarterectomy

- The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid disease with ≥50% stenosis in patients >65 years of age can be as high as 10%. The risk of ischemic stroke increases with the degree of stenosis, the progression of the stenosis and the presence of coronary disease, hypertension and/or peripheral vascular disease.​[[8]](#c0023n00025) The annual rate of unheralded stroke ipsilateral to a substantial (≥50%) asymptomatic stenosis is about 1.5%.​[[8]](#c0023n00025) The presence of carotid disease is a marker of concomitant coronary disease, which accounts for about half of all ischemic events in these individuals.​[[8]](#c0023n00025) No evidence supports the use of ASA for ischemic stroke prevention specifically in this clinical context; however, its use is recommended for its cardioprotective effects. The role of prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid disease may be considered in select individuals with a high degree (≥60–70%) of stenosis, predicted life expectancy of 3–5 years and when expected complication rates are low (≤3%).​[[9]](#c0023n00026) In many cases, however, it is also acceptable to treat medically with control of vascular risk factors and appropriate antithrombotics.​[[10]](#JonesDWBrottTGSchermerhornML.Trials-66847412)
- Recommend CEA in addition to long-term antithrombotic therapy for patients with carotid symptoms that are ipsilateral to a significant (≥70%) carotid stenosis documented by angiography, cervical duplex, MRA or CT angiography. Although less beneficial, consider CEA for symptomatic 50–69% stenosis in selected individuals.​[[10]](#JonesDWBrottTGSchermerhornML.Trials-66847412) The optimal timing for CEA is within 2 weeks of the ischemic event. Carotid stenting (CAS) should remain an alternative only in selective cases for which CEA is thought too risky (substantial coronary risk, repeat endarterectomy, anatomical variants and radiation damage).​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[10]](#JonesDWBrottTGSchermerhornML.Trials-66847412)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Antiplatelet agents (see [Table 1](#c0023n00023)) are the drugs of choice for long-term prevention of atherothrombotic events (embolic phenomena secondary to intra-arterial disease).​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[11]](#c0023n00027) Oral anticoagulants are used to prevent cerebral ischemic events from emboli presumed to be of cardiac origin (see Supraventricular Tachycardia).

Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments have been shown to be effective for patients who have previously experienced a TIA or an ischemic stroke.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[12]](#c0023n00029)​[[13]](#KatsanosAHFilippatouAManiosEEtAl.Bl-668479FC) Discussion of appropriate treatment options and targets can be found in Dyslipidemias and Hypertension.

### Antiplatelet Agents

### Acetylsalicylic Acid

Often given as initial therapy for stroke prevention, ASA, when used in high-risk individuals, results in about a 25% relative risk reduction (RRR) of vascular events (cardiac and cerebral). Its protective effect is more modest in patients with TIA or ischemic stroke, with approximately 13% RRR for the prevention of major vascular events.​[[11]](#c0023n00027)​[[14]](#c0023n00163) It is well tolerated with side effects that are often dose-dependent. Patient acceptability and low cost are advantages. The recommended dosage for stroke prevention is 80–325 mg/day,​[[2]](#c0023n00036) depending on the patient’s tolerance and the clinical situation.

When combined with an oral anticoagulant, ASA 100 mg/day provides better protection against cardioembolic events than an anticoagulant alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves;​[[15]](#c0023n00032) however, this combination does increase the risk of systemic bleeding and should be used with caution.

### Thienopyridines

Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is somewhat more effective than ASA for the prevention of ischemic events, including stroke, in patients at high risk of ischemic events.​[[16]](#c0023n00033) The absolute difference in annual rate of ischemic stroke, MI or vascular death between clopidogrel and ASA is 0.5%, corresponding to an 8.7% RRR in favour of clopidogrel. Thus, clopidogrel is an alternative antiplatelet agent in patients who are allergic to or cannot tolerate ASA.​[[16]](#c0023n00033) It can be prescribed as an alternative in patients who have new cerebral ischemic events while on ASA, although there are no clinical trials to support this practice.

In patients with a history of stroke or TIA, combined use of **low-dose ASA and clopidogrel** long-term is associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, and does not significantly reduce the rate of ischemic events, including stroke.​[[17]](#c0023n00034)​[[18]](#c0023n00035)​[[19]](#c0023n00179) Long-term use of ASA plus clopidogrel is not routinely recommended for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.​[[2]](#c0023n00036) However, short-term use of the ASA/clopidogrel combination for between 21 and 30 days has recently been shown to be beneficial in the acute setting.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[20]](#WangYWangYZhaoXEtAl.ClopidogrelWith-9C2D28F7)​[[21]](#JohnstonSCEastonJDFarrantMEtAl.Clop-6684825E)

### Dipyridamole/ASA

Dipyridamole/​ASA (200/25 mg) given twice daily reduces the relative risk of stroke by 23% (mostly for ischemic stroke) when compared with ASA in patients with cerebral ischemic symptoms.​[[22]](#c0023n00038) This finding was confirmed in a randomized controlled trial in which the incidence of death, stroke, MI or major bleeding complications was significantly lower in patients with cerebral ischemia treated with dipyridamole/ASA than ASA alone (absolute risk reduction 3%, RRR 19% and NNT 34 over a mean of 3.5 years).​[[23]](#c0023n00039) No increased risk of cardiac events was reported in the dipyridamole/ASA groups in either study; however, a higher daily dose of ASA may be desirable in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease. The addition of ASA 81 mg once daily to the twice-daily dipyridamole/ASA combination appears reasonable in these patients, though the efficacy and safety of this measure are unknown. Because dipyridamole/ASA is administered twice a day and it is associated with a higher rate of drug discontinuation due to side effects, e.g., headache, it is recommended as a second-line option.

### Anticoagulants

### Vitamin K Antagonists

Oral anticoagulants prevent cerebral and systemic emboli in patients with acute MI, valvular and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic cardiac valves. The risk of bleeding is influenced by many factors, e.g., the intensity of anticoagulation, concomitant use of high doses of ASA or other drugs with antiplatelet effects.​[[24]](#c0023n00040) Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) are superior to clopidogrel plus ASA for prevention of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke.​[[25]](#c0023n00127) For most patients, the INR target is 2.5 with a goal time in therapeutic range >70%.​[[2]](#c0023n00036) Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and prior TIA/stroke may require a higher target INR of 3.​[[26]](#c0023n00041)

### Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation based on the results of the RE-LY study.​[[27]](#c0023n00133) The oral factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are also approved for this indication.​[[28]](#c0023n00147)​[[29]](#c0023n00170)​[[30]](#GiuglianoRPRuffCTBraunwaldEEtAlEdox-947EC53D) Most clinical practice guidelines consider these novel anticoagulants useful alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[31]](#c0023n00148)​[[32]](#c0023n00149)​[[33]](#KotechaDKirchhofP.WhatsNewInThe2016-6686AB2B) In many cases, these agents are suggested as a first choice, especially for patients in whom anticoagulant therapy needs to be initiated. Overall, they have similar or superior efficacy for the prevention of ischemic events and a comparable if not better safety profile, in particular for intracranial hemorrhages. Cautious patient selection is important, especially in elderly patients with renal insufficiency in whom renal function monitoring is advised. Combining direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists with antiplatelet therapy is not recommended unless there is an additional cardiac indication. Specific agents are available to reverse the antithrombotic effect of these agents in certain circumstances (e.g., urgent surgery).​[[34]](#CukerABurnettATrillerDEtAl.Reversal-6686AED9)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Secondary Stroke Prevention and Pregnancy

During pregnancy, the risk of stroke is highest during the peripartum and postpartum periods. A multidisciplinary approach including stroke and maternal-fetal medicine expertise is suggested for optimal management and prevention.​[[35]](#SwartzRHLadhaniNNNFoleyNEtAl.Canadi-6686B188)

### Secondary Stroke Prevention during Pregnancy

The choice of an antithrombotic will depend mostly on the stroke etiology: anticoagulants if cardioembolic or antiplatelet for all other etiologies. If an antiplatelet agent is required, low-dose ASA 81 mg daily would be the medication of choice, as there is less evidence to support the safety of other antiplatelets during pregnancy. When anticoagulation is indicated, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred, warfarin is potentially teratogenic, and insufficient information exists at present for the DOACs during pregnancy. Pharmacological blood pressure management for stroke prevention (ischemic and hemorrhagic) during pregnancy should include as first choices labetalol, methyldopa or long-acting nifedipine. Close monitoring of blood pressure is suggested and the recommended target is < 140/90 (see also Hypertension). Management of hyperlipidemia should be based on a healthy diet and exercise. There is a lack of reliable information regarding the safety of statins during pregnancy; it would thus be reasonable to avoid these drugs.

### Secondary Stroke Prevention and Breastfeeding

Low-dose ASA is considered safe during breastfeeding, but the safety of other antiplatelet agents is unknown. Warfarin is also considered safe during breastfeeding, but the safety of the DOACs has not been established. The same group of antihypertensive medications considered safe in pregnancy, can be used during breastfeeding. Other drugs may also be considered (see Hypertension). Lipid-lowering medications are not recommended during breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- In most cases, antithrombotic treatment should be continued long term, especially in older individuals with atherosclerosis and vascular risk factors.
- For prevention of recurrent stroke, dipyridamole/​ASA appears to be more protective than ASA alone if started within 6 months of a cerebral ischemic event.​[[23]](#c0023n00039) Dipyridamole/​ASA and clopidogrel appear to provide comparable protection against recurrent stroke.​[[36]](#c0023n00126)
- It is common practice to switch treatment to dipyridamole/​ASA or clopidogrel in patients who experience *recurrent* attacks of cerebral ischemia while on doses of ASA 325 mg/day or less, although this has not been validated in clinical trials.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[37]](#Cxf4txe9RZangYHartRGEtAl.ASAFailure-9C262BED)
- The combination of **low-dose** ASA (81 mg/day) **plus an oral anticoagulant** in patients who have *new events* while on an anticoagulant alone and who are at risk for a cardioembolic stroke is not recommended. The efficacy of this approach has not been confirmed in clinical trials, and the risk for hemorrhagic complications is increased.
- Combination therapy (**oral anticoagulant plus low-dose** ASA) is superior to anticoagulant alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves but carries an increased risk of bleeding episodes. For patients *intolerant* of ASA, dipyridamole (400 mg/day) plus an oral anticoagulant may be used. This approach has not been validated in clinical trials.
- The combination of **low-dose** ASA (80 mg) **plus** clopidogrel is not recommended for long-term stroke prevention. However, in the acute setting, the short-term use (21–30 days) of this combination is beneficial.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[20]](#WangYWangYZhaoXEtAl.ClopidogrelWith-9C2D28F7)​[[21]](#JohnstonSCEastonJDFarrantMEtAl.Clop-6684825E)
- In healthy postmenopausal women, the risks associated with hormone therapy (increased risk of coronary heart disease and breast cancer and a 40% increase in stroke risk) exceed the beneficial effects on colorectal cancer and hip fracture.​[[38]](#c0023n00042)
- In postmenopausal women who have suffered a recent stroke or TIA, hormonal therapy with **estrogen** does not have a protective effect.​[[39]](#c0023n00043)
- The use of **hormonal** contraceptives is associated with a small increase in the absolute risk of ischemic stroke.​[[40]](#c0023n00044) It is recommended that oral contraceptives be avoided in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.​[[2]](#c0023n00036) In addition, they should probably be avoided in the presence of other risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, smoking and migraine with aura.​[[2]](#c0023n00036)​[[41]](#TepperNKWhitemanMKZapataLBEtAl..Saf-5490DD7E) See Contraception for a full discussion of contraceptive options.
