### Introduction

Without proper tools (such as a visual acuity chart, slit lamp or indirect ophthalmoscope), it is difficult for a primary care practitioner to diagnose and manage the complications of a postoperative cataract patient. The goal of this chapter is to review signs and symptoms that would require an urgent referral to an ophthalmologist. These include postoperative infection, glaucoma, inflammation or any suspected issues with healing. [Figure 1](#c0017n00001) can be utilized to help assess if urgent referral is required.

The medications listed within the chapter are those that are typically given *prophylactically* to prevent infection (see [Table 2](#c0017n00250)), a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) (see [Table 3](#c0017n00253)) and cystoid macular edema (CME) (see [Table 4](#c0017n00252)), as well as to improve healing (see [Table 5](#c0017n00251)).

### Goals of Therapy

The goals of *perioperative prophylactic pharmacologic treatment* are:

- Control inflammation
- Prevent infection
- Maintain eye comfort
- Promote early visual rehabilitation

The goals of *postoperative assessment* are:

- Detect intraocular infection in its early stages
- Detect postoperative uveitis or IOP elevation
- Detect other abnormalities in the postoperative course, such as a retinal detachment, iris prolapse, wound leak, flat anterior chamber, excessive corneal edema or intraocular hemorrhage

### Investigations

[Figure 1](#c0017n00001) illustrates an assessment process for the postoperative cataract patient. [Table 1](#RedFlags) summarizes the red flags requiring urgent referral.

- Pain:

  - the postoperative eye should be comfortable; at worst, the patient may have a mild foreign-body sensation
  - more intense pain may suggest increased IOP, increased inflammation and/or infection; postoperative inflammation is more common within the first 48 hours of surgery, while postoperative infection is most common between 3 and 7 days following surgery
- History of recent trauma:

  - any trauma to the eye in the early postoperative phase requires thorough reassessment with a slit lamp
- Change in vision (worsening, darkening, loss of detail or peripheral visual loss):

  - any significant change could indicate infection, hemorrhage, retinal detachment or other acute intraocular pathology requiring immediate attention
- Visual phenomena (flashing lights, dark shadows or floaters):

  - worsening of floaters requires thorough reassessment to rule out infection, retinal tear/detachment or uveitis
  - in the first few days or weeks after implantation of an intraocular lens, many patients notice a glare or shadow in the peripheral vision (dysphotopsia); if within this time frame, it is usually not a cause for concern, provided that confrontation visual field testing (finger counting using peripheral vision) is normal
  - using a pinhole to test visual acuity will eliminate the effect of refractive error if the patient has apparent reduced acuity
- Itching of the eye (as predominant symptom):

  - suggests allergy to medications or dry eye
  - patient should be re-examined to determine the cause of itching and whether alternate eye drops should be prescribed
- Examination of eye:

  - swelling of lids and/or conjunctiva suggest drug allergy or infection
  - pupil(s) should react normally to light unless a mydriatic agent has been used; photophobia (glare sensitivity and pain from light exposure) can indicate anterior uveitis or corneal haze (from infection, inflammation or increased IOP)
  - the cornea should be clear of any clouding or infiltrates (to rule out corneal or anterior segment infection, inflammation, or IOP elevation); it should reflect a clear, well-demarcated image when the direct ophthalmoscope or pupil light is shone on it
  - ophthalmoscope should be used to see if the disc is clearly viewed and a red reflex is present (to rule out vitreous clouding, inflammation or infection)
- Review of ocular medications:

  - reinforce proper use
  - clarify any confusion
  - discuss with family member
- Verify follow-up visits with surgeon

**Table 1:** Red Flags Requiring Urgent Referral

| On history: | On examination: |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trauma to eye postsurgery | Swollen or red eyelids or conjunctiva | Hazy cornea |
| Blurry or worsening vision | Hypopyon (white layer) in anterior chamber | Poor or absent red reflex with direct ophthalmoscopy |
| Persistent or progressively painful eye (may also have headache, nausea, vomiting or feel unwell) or light sensitivity | Flat (poorly formed) anterior chamber | Seidel-positive wounds (leakage of fluid from anterior chamber when fluorescein is instilled in eye) or iris peaking toward wound or prolapsing from wound |
| Persistent or progressive shadows, flashes, or floaters | Elevated intraocular pressure |  |

### Therapeutic Choices

Although cataract surgery is a very commonly performed procedure, practice patterns related to patients’ preoperative and postoperative care vary depending upon the surgeons’ preferences and habits.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Prophylactic ophthalmic medications may include:

- **Antibacterials** (see [Table 2](#c0017n00250))

  The measures used to reduce the risk of postoperative endophthalmitis are preoperative use of iodized povidone, preoperative and postoperative antibiotics, and the use of intraoperative intracameral antibiotics.​[[1]](#Ciulla2002)​[[2]](#Nentwich2015)

  A broad-spectrum antibacterial is often used perioperatively to reduce the risk of endophthalmitis. The endophthalmitis rates reported in the literature have decreased from 0.32% in the 1970s to 0.29% or less in the early 2000s, depending upon the country.​[[3]](#Carrim2009)​[[4]](#Melo2010)​[[5]](#Friling2013) Declining rates of infection have been attributed to better technology, perioperative use of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones and the introduction of anterior chamber injection of antibiotics at the end of the surgery.​[[6]](#EndophthalmitisStudyGroupEuropeanSo-A70D9677)​[[7]](#Moshirfar2007)​[[8]](#Romero-Aroca2012)

  Despite inconsistent evidence that perioperative antibiotics reduce the rate of endophthalmitis, antimicrobials before, during and after cataract surgery have become standard of care. However, there are controversies regarding the choice of antimicrobial, its route of administration, duration and timing.​[[9]](#Aragona2020)​[[10]](#Bandello2020) Perioperative topical antibiotics such as fourth-generation fluoroquinolones (besifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) are commonly used.​[[11]](#c0017n00226)​[[12]](#c0017n00227) Alternatively, fixed combination preparations containing an antibacterial and a corticosteroid, e.g., tobramycin/​dexamethasone, may be preferred by some surgeons for their ease of use, which can potentially improve adherence to therapy. Local bacterial resistance patterns may also influence a surgeon’s choice of perioperative antibacterial agent.​[[13]](#Sadaka2017)​[[14]](#Yannuzzi2018)​[[15]](#Stringham2017)​[[16]](#Kato2021)

  Alternatively, an antibiotic can be administered by intracameral injection, whereby the antibiotic is injected directly into the anterior chamber of the eye at the end of the surgery. Evidence for the effectiveness of this practice is conflicting. Some studies have shown no benefit with this method,​[[17]](#SharmaSSahuSKDhillonVEtAl.Reevaluat-A4E4C59F)​[[18]](#RudniskyCJWanDWeisE.AntibioticChoic-A4E4C371) while others, including one study by the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons, have found it to be more effective than intraoperative topical antibacterial therapy.​[[6]](#EndophthalmitisStudyGroupEuropeanSo-A70D9677)​[[19]](#Haripriya2017)​[[20]](#Shorstein2013)​[[21]](#Bowen2018)​[[22]](#MontanPGWejdeGKoranyiGEtAl.Prophyla-AA8B540A)​[[23]](#Linertova2014)​[[24]](#Moser2019) Furthermore, there are concerns regarding intracameral use of noncommercially prepared antibiotic preparations, which may impact a surgeon’s decision.​[[25]](#Chang2015) These include issues such as development of resistant strains or toxic anterior segment syndrome.​[[13]](#Sadaka2017)​[[14]](#Yannuzzi2018)​[[15]](#Stringham2017)​[[16]](#Kato2021)​[[26]](#LundstromMFrilingEMontanP.RiskFacto-A4E6000D) Most recently, the use of intracameral **vancomycin** was associated with a rare but devastating complication termed hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV).​[[27]](#WitkinAJChangDFJumperJMEtAl.Vancomy-A4E601EF) When selecting an intracameral agent, the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an agent may guide a surgeon’s decision.​[[23]](#Linertova2014)
- **Glaucoma medications** (see [Table 3](#c0017n00253))

  These medications are used temporarily to lower the IOP after eye surgery if it is elevated. Patients with pre-existing glaucoma should be encouraged to continue using their preoperative glaucoma drops. The medication regimen may need to be modified during the postoperative period to protect against an early postoperative rise in IOP. If an IOP spike occurs in the postoperative period, it generally lasts only a few days and is amenable to topical medical management. The surgeon will typically select a noninflammatory antiglaucoma agent, such as an alpha-adrenergic agent, beta-adrenergic antagonist or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, combined with close monitoring to ensure pressure-lowering effect. Occasionally a surgical procedure called an anterior chamber paracentesis may be required to reduce the pressure.
- **Anti-inflammatory agents** (see [Table 4](#c0017n00252))

  These medications are used for a few weeks postoperatively to reduce inflammation and the risk of developing CME. A Cochrane review of low-quality evidence demonstrated that ophthalmic NSAIDs alone or in combination with ophthalmic corticosteroids may be more effective in controlling inflammation and preventing CME when compared with ophthalmic corticosteroids alone.​[[28]](#JuthaniVVClearfieldEChuckRS.Non-ste-8040CA86) Additional studies have validated the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in the prevention of postoperative inflammation and CME.​[[29]](#Erichsen2020)​[[30]](#Ylinen2018)​[[31]](#ElGharbawy2019) Anti-inflammatory agents may contribute to a faster visual recovery and reduced postoperative pain.​[[32]](#Fong2019) There is variation in practice regarding the selection of anti-inflammatory agent, so it is best to consult the surgeon if there is any confusion regarding which drop the patient should use.​[[33]](#Palacio-Pastrana2020)​[[34]](#Abessi2018)​[[35]](#KhalafAllah2019)​[[36]](#Wang2020)​[[37]](#Toyos2019)​[[38]](#Donnenfeld2018)​[[39]](#Tzelikis2018)
- Ophthalmic dilators and cycloplegics (see [Table 5](#c0017n00251))

  These medications are used to keep the iris away from the implant during the early healing period and to improve comfort by decreasing ciliary muscle spasm.
- **Oral analgesics**  may be required (e.g., acetaminophen 500 mg every 4–6 hours).

Other systemic medications should be continued, including antiplatelets and anticoagulants, unless otherwise specified by the surgeon.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Any changes to postoperative ophthalmic medications should be discussed with the treating ophthalmologist.
- Initiate topical antibacterial drops immediately following surgery rather than waiting until the first postoperative day.​[[40]](#c0017n00344)​[[41]](#c0017n00345)​[[42]](#c0017n00346)
- Advise patients to separate the administration of different eye drops by a period of at least 5 minutes. If there is a contraindication to systemic absorption of the medication, counsel the patient to close the eye and, while trying to avoid touching the operated eye, put pressure on the inner canthus for 30–60 seconds after instilling drops. This is done to reduce the transfer of ophthalmic medication to the nasal and/or oral mucosa where it may be absorbed systemically. In all other patients, simply closing the eye for 30–60 seconds may be sufficient to maximize ophthalmic absorption.
- Any worsening of vision, floaters, eye pain or redness, especially in the first postoperative week, should be considered endophthalmitis until proven otherwise and requires urgent assessment by an ophthalmologist.
- Treatment with many medications in this setting is for a limited course; therefore, any unused ophthalmic medication should be disposed of properly.
- Patients having clear corneal cataract surgery should take all their usual medications (including anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents) on the day of surgery except for some diabetic medications. Due to the risk of hypoglycemia, insulin and insulin secretagogue (sulfonylureas, meglitinides) doses may be modified or the medication may be held the day before or on the day of surgery. Metformin may be held the day before and on the day of surgery due to the risk of lactic acidosis. If medication doses and/or regimens are modified, more frequent glucose monitoring may be required.​[[43]](#MarksJB.PerioperativeManagementOfDi-D01807BC) This should be discussed with the physician prior to surgery.
- There may be room for improvement in prescribing patterns, with potential substantial cost savings, given the lack of superior efficacy of costly versus less-costly eye drops in the perioperative period.​[[44]](#Zafar2020)
