### Introduction

Obesity is a complex heterogeneous disorder that places individuals at increased risk for adverse health consequences from the accumulation of excess and abnormal body fat (adiposity).​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020) It is a progressive and relapsing condition; both the World Obesity Federation and the Canadian Medical Association classify obesity as a chronic medical disease.​[[2]](#refitem-117211-4946FB68) In 2015, 28.1% of Canadians 18 years of age or older—an estimated 10 million adults—were classified as having obesity.​[[3]](#refitem-119212-4A3DE2BB) Childhood obesity is likewise on the rise, affecting more than 580 000 children in Canada.​[[4]](#refitem-119213-4AC4F44F)

### Goals of Therapy

- The overall aim is to improve health for those with adiposity-related health impairments
- At a minimum, the goal is to stabilize and prevent further weight gain
- Prevent weight regain
- Prevent and treat obesity-related comorbidities and complications

### Investigations

### Screening and Initial Assessment

Historically, the definition of obesity was based on body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m​2, calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)​2. However, BMI likely underestimates the effects of excess body weight on health, as weight distribution and ectopic adiposity may increase health risks, even at BMI levels well below the conventional BMI cut-offs.​[[7]](#c0107n00024) Measures of abdominal obesity, such as waist circumference, have been suggested as additional markers of cardiometabolic risk. While the integration of BMI and waist circumference may provide a better assessment of cardiometabolic health than BMI alone, it still has many limitations. Most importantly, this classification system was created using data from White European males and is less accurate with respect to young adults who have not yet reached full growth, lean or muscular adults, adults over 65 years of age, and people of different ancestries such as Asian, Black, Canadian First Nations and Inuit.

Because of these limitations, clinicians should not rely on BMI beyond initial screening.​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020) More comprehensive staging tools should be used to assess mortality risk based on adiposity. The Edmonton Obesity Staging System ranks mortality risk in individuals with overweight based on obesity-related comorbidities and functional status.​[[8]](#c0107n00167) This tool is meant to complement anthropometric measures, provide a meaningful method of triaging patients and has been validated as a better predictor of mortality than BMI (see [Table 1](#c0107n99165)).

**Table 1:** Classification of Obesity using the Edmonton Obesity Staging System

| Stage | Assessment of weight-related health problems, mental health and quality of life |
| 0 | No sign of obesity-related risk factors No physical symptoms No psychological symptoms No functional limitations |
| 1 | Patient has obesity-related subclinical risk factors or Mild physical symptoms; patient currently not requiring medical treatment for comorbidities or Mild obesity-related psychological symptoms and/or mild impairment of well-being |
| 2 | Patient has established obesity-related comorbidities requiring medical intervention or Moderate obesity-related psychological symptoms or Moderate functional limitations in daily activities |
| 3 | Patient has significant obesity-related end-organ damage or Significant obesity-related psychological symptoms or Significant functional limitations or Significant impairment of well-being |
| 4 | Severe (potential end-stage) disabilities from obesity-related comorbidities or Severely disabling psychological symptoms or Severe functional limitations or Severe impairment in well-being |

### Additional Investigations

- A thorough history can help identify root drivers of weight gain. Obesity Canada’s 4M framework classifies these root drivers as either mechanical, mental, metabolic and/or social milieu. Additionally, a thorough history can help predict potential complications and barriers to treatment. Such history can include:

  - weight history, including previous attempts at weight loss, precipitating events (pregnancy, injury) and contributing factors such as medications (see [Table 2](#medications))
  - lifestyle (diet and activity); readiness for change; psychosocial, emotional and physical barriers to lifestyle change; smoking; alcohol; substance abuse
  - reasons for willingness to change and possible health and quality-of-life goals
  - family history of obesity and comorbidities
  - support system and insurance coverage for obesity treatment
  - assessment as indicated for anxiety (see Anxiety Disorders), attention deficit (see Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), depression (see Depression), eating disorders (see Eating Disorders) and insomnia (see Insomnia)
- Physical examination:

  - check vital signs
  - target organ damage, including hepatomegaly, abdominal wall hernias, acanthosis nigricans, intertrigo
  - identify genetic and associated conditions
  - assess for low back pain (see Low Back Pain) and osteoarthritis (see Osteoarthritis) as indicated
  - assess for chronic fatigue syndrome (see Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and fibromyalgia (see Fibromyalgia) as indicated
- Laboratory and diagnostic procedures:

  - screen for diabetes mellitus (see Diabetes Mellitus), dyslipidemia (see Dyslipidemias), hypertension (see Hypertension) and gout (see Gout and Hyperuricemia)
  - conduct liver function tests—liver ultrasound where indicated
  - discourage routine thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testing
  - assess pulmonary functions and sleep studies where indicated
  - conduct ECG, exercise test and echocardiography where indicated
  - assess for gastroesophageal reflux and gallbladder disease where indicated

**Table 2:** Medications Associated with Weight Gain

### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of obesity is presented in [Figure 1](#c0107n00053).

### Strategies for Treatment of Obesity

Obesity is a heterogeneous condition and no single management strategy works for every patient. There is currently no cure for obesity; successful management involves a long-term “coping” strategy that allows the patient to reduce their body weight and prevent weight regain. Typically, treatment is characterized by intermittent periods of remission and relapse, commonly referred to as “weight cycling.” The health risks of weight cycling versus maintaining a long-term stable weight remain controversial.

Obesity Canada has developed a set of tools based on the 5As framework for obesity management. Embedded in the tool are the established tenets of chronic disease management including patient eduction, self-management, ongoing follow-up and support (see [Table 3](#c0107n00127)).

**Table 3:** Obesity Canada’s 5As of Obesity Management​[[9]](#c0107n00128)

|  | Definition | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ask | Ask permission to discuss weight; be non-judgmental; explore readiness for change. | Weight is a sensitive issue; avoid verbal or nonverbal cues that imply judgment; indication of readiness may predict outcomes. |
| Assess | Assess BMI, waist circumference, obesity stage (see Table 1 ); explore root causes of obesity. | BMI alone should not serve as an indicator for obesity interventions. |
| Advise | Advise on health risks of obesity, benefits of modest weight loss, need for long-term strategy, treatment options. | Health risk of excess weight can vary; avoidance of weight gain and/or modest weight loss can have health benefits; treatment options should consider risk. |
| Agree | Agree on realistic weight loss expectations and targets, specifics of treatment plan. | Most patients have unrealistic expectations; interventions should focus on changing behaviour; providers should seek patient’s desire for proposed treatment. |
| Assist | Assist in identifying and addressing barriers; provide resources and assist in identifying and consulting with appropriate providers; arrange regular follow-up. | Most patients have significant barriers to weight management; patients are confused and cannot identify credible from noncredible sources of information; follow-up is an essential principle of chronic disease management. |

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Multicomponent behavioural interventions (healthy food choices and increased physical activity) should be encouraged and can be supported with 3 primary interventions: bariatric surgery, pharmacotherapy and psychological intervention. Additionally, behavioural interventions should consider the patient’s experience and underlying causes of obesity and avoid simplistic approaches such as “eat less, move more.”​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020)

### Nutrition Planning and Diet Composition

In addition to safety, efficacy and nutritional adequacy, nutritional interventions should be culturally acceptable to the patient, affordable, and meet the patient’s individual values and treatment goals.​[[5]](#ObesityCanadaMNT) All structured, calorie-restricted diets result in comparable and significant short-term weight loss in adherent patients;​[[6]](#Johnston2014) however, long-term efficacy and safety of diets have not been established in randomized controlled trials. Additionally, caloric restriction is associated with changes to neurobiological pathways that would favour increased food intake and weight gain.​[[5]](#ObesityCanadaMNT)

### Physical Activity

Increased physical activity and fitness are clearly associated with a reduction in cardiometabolic risk.​[[10]](#c0107n00026) Regular physical activity also enhances the patient’s sense of well-being, promotes weight maintenance, and reduces insulin resistance and the loss of bone mineral density that is associated with weight loss.​[[11]](#c0107n00027) However, exercise alone is not an effective strategy for weight loss.​[[12]](#refitem-1192115-4A40E1DC)

Individual patients should be assessed to determine fitness level before starting an exercise program. A treadmill stress test should be considered for individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk.

- Exercise coupled pharmacotherapy may help accelerate fat loss while maintaining lean body mass and helps sustain weight loss over the long term.
- Encourage all patients to spend ≥30 minutes doing continuous or intermittent (minimum of 10-minute bouts accumulated throughout the day) physical activity at least 5 days each week. Initially, physical activity could begin with 5–10 minute bouts, with increasing frequency, duration and intensity over time.
- Resistance training can help build lean body mass and sustain weight loss in the long term.
- Higher intensity exercise (e.g., high-intensity interval training [HIIT]) is associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Higher intensity training can also help achieve similar benefits to moderate-intensity activity in a shorter amount of time.
- Wearable activity trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch and smartphone apps) can reliably measure heart rate, number of steps and distance travelled. However, wearable activity trackers do not accurately measure energy expenditure and therefore caution must be exercised when using such measurement for meal planning.​[[13]](#Evenson2015)

### Psychological Interventions

Psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]; acceptance and commitment therapy) and behavioural therapy (e.g., goal-setting, cognitive restructuring, stimulus control and relapse prevention) can successfully support behavioural interventions (i.e., interventions that aim to increase energy expenditure and decrease caloric intake). These forms of therapy can be most successful when educating and supporting patients with:​[[14]](#OCguidelinespsychiatry2020)

- Internalized weight bias (e.g., by considering obesity as a medical condition rather than a moral failure by the individual)
- Managing expectations (e.g., by shifting the focus on satisfaction with health gains rather than with weight loss, and by discussing the neurohormonal responses to weight loss that favour weight gain)
- Values-oriented behaviour (e.g., by supporting patients in choosing behaviours consistent with their values)
- Awareness of wanting (e.g., by identifying high-risk settings)
- Restraint development (e.g., by educating patients about permission thoughts and restraint thoughts and ways to counter these thoughts by considering personal values)
- Understanding modulators (e.g., by educating patients about the modulators of the appetite system and by managing issues such as stress, fatigue and anxiety)

Although more research is needed, evidence suggests that behavioural therapy delivered using various technologies (e.g., phone-counselling, smartphone apps, web-based methods) can be successful in achieving behavioural modifications and can therefore be considered, especially as adjuncts to in-person delivery of such therapies.​[[14]](#OCguidelinespsychiatry2020)

### Bariatric Surgery

Evidence suggests that bariatric surgery provides significant psychosocial and health benefits in patients with severe obesity,​[[15]](#c0107n00031) including reduction in both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.​[[16]](#c0107n00135)​[[17]](#c0107n00136)​[[18]](#c0107n00137) Maintenance of weight loss for up to 15 years has also been demonstrated.​[[19]](#c0107n00169) As a result, bariatric surgery should be considered in patients with severe obesity (Stage 2 with comorbidities or higher).​[[15]](#c0107n00031)​[[16]](#c0107n00135)​[[17]](#c0107n00136)​[[18]](#c0107n00137)​[[20]](#c0107n00143) Furthermore, the superiority of bariatric surgery to conventional treatment in preventing and controlling diabetes in patients with obesity has been demonstrated.​[[21]](#c0107n00168)​[[22]](#c0107n00139)​[[23]](#c0107n00140)​[[24]](#c0107n00141)​[[25]](#c0107n00181)

Risks and long-term complications of bariatric surgery are unclear and may vary depending on baseline patient characteristics and type of surgery performed.​[[26]](#c0107n00186) One-year mortality rates postsurgery range from 0.3%–4.6%; long-term mortality data are not available.​[[27]](#c0107n00170)​[[28]](#c0107n00180) Postoperative complications occur in 17% of patients and the re-operation rate is 7%.​[[28]](#c0107n00180) Complications most commonly include GI obstruction, surgical site infections and incisional hernia.​[[29]](#c0107n00172)

### Eligibility for Bariatric Surgery

Bariatric surgery should be considered in individuals with severe obesity or those with moderate obesity and at least 1 obesity-related comorbidity.​[[30]](#c0107n00149) Obesity Canada recommends also considering patients with obesity who have attempted nonsurgical weight-loss interventions.​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020) Relative contraindications for bariatric surgery include severe heart failure, unstable coronary artery disease, end-stage lung disease, active cancer diagnosis/treatment, cirrhosis with portal hypertension, Crohn disease, uncontrolled drug or alcohol dependency, and severely impaired intellectual capacity. Laparoscopic surgery may be difficult or impossible in patients with giant ventral hernias, severe intra-abdominal adhesions, a large liver, central obesity or physiological intolerance of pneumoperitoneum.

A team approach to perioperative care is mandatory with special attention to nutritional and metabolic issues.​[[31]](#c0107n00151) The best outcomes are achieved by interdisciplinary teams working in high-volume centres and are largely dependent on appropriate patient selection and follow-up. Patients with underlying psychiatric or emotional issues should be carefully evaluated. Counsel on the need for lifelong nutritional changes to avoid nutritional complications.

### Nutritional Counselling

Postoperative nutritional therapy following bariatric surgery depends on the type of bariatric procedure performed.​[[31]](#c0107n00151) All postbariatric surgery patients should have routine screening for nutritional deficiencies. See [Table 4](#c0107n00152) for specific recommendations. Generally, patients will require 2 complete multivitamin pills per day in addition to calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. However, as multivitamin formulations may vary, health-care providers and patients need to carefully check the labels.​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020) Drugs to avoid after bariatric surgery include GI irritants (e.g., oral bisphosphonates and NSAIDs) and drugs at high risk of inducing hypoglycemia (e.g., sulfonylureas).

**Table 4:** Postoperative Follow-Up for Bariatric Surgery

| Follow-up | LAGB/ LSG | RYGB | BPD/BPD-DS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visits: initial, interval until stable, once stable (months) | 1, 1–2, 12 | 1, 3, 6–12 | 1, 3, 6 |

### Pharmacologic Choices

- The combination of lifestyle modification and antiobesity drug therapy is superior to lifestyle modification alone.
- Discontinuation of antiobesity medication generally results in weight regain and should therefore be continued as long as there is benefit. Antiobesity medications can also be used to maintain weight loss achieved by lifestyle modifications.
- There is no indication that currently available antiobesity medications are associated with pulmonary hypertension, valvular dysfunction or other cardiovascular abnormalities associated with earlier antiobesity medications such as sibutramine, which was removed from the Canadian market in 2010 due to concerns about heart-related adverse events.

See [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss) and [Table 6](#c0107n00048) for a comparison of different weight loss medications.

### Orlistat

Orlistat 120 mg TID (see [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss) and [Table 6](#c0107n00048)) is a pancreatic and gastric lipase inhibitor that reduces dietary fat absorption by 30%, resulting in an effective reduction in caloric intake of around 180 kcal/day on a diet containing 60 g of fat.​[[32]](#Hutton2004) A high fat intake is poorly tolerated during orlistat therapy because of an increased incidence of GI adverse effects, including bloating, steatorrhea and oily discharge. Orlistat is less effective in patients on low-fat diets and is difficult to take for individuals with irregular eating patterns. In randomized, double-blind long-term trials, orlistat was associated with a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 2.9 kg.​[[32]](#Hutton2004)​[[33]](#Rucker2007) Orlistat is approved for use in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycemic and metabolic control.

### Naltrexone/Bupropion

The bupropion/​naltrexone 180/16 mg BID (extended release) formulation (see [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss) and [Table 6](#c0107n00048)) is indicated for weight management alongside diet and exercise for adults with obesity or overweight with the presence of at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. The combination has a synergistic mode of action and works by mediating hormones involved in appetite and reward at the level of the hypothalamus. Neither bupropion or naltrexone have meaningful effect on weight loss alone. Bupropion/naltrexone (extended release) was associated with a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 4.1%.​[[34]](#refitem-1192117-4AB8EF69) The most common adverse effect is transient nausea.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist

Liraglutide 3 mg daily (see [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss) and [Table 6](#c0107n00048)) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist that is administered by subcutaneous injection. GLP-1 agonists stimulate insulin secretion, reduce postprandial glucagon levels, slow gastric emptying and reduce appetite, resulting in both weight reduction and reduced blood glucose levels. Liraglutide has been approved in Canada for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and has also been indicated for chronic weight management in adults as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. It has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, e.g., cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke, when used for management of diabetes or weight loss.​[[35]](#Davies2017) Clinical trials have shown that in conjunction with lifestyle measures, liraglutide 3 mg daily SC can induce and sustain a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 2–6% and may be used as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults with obesity or those with overweight plus at least 1 weight-related comorbidity (such as diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia).​[[37]](#refitem-1142122-950D6369)​[[39]](#refitem-1142123-950D8903)​[[40]](#Konwar2022)

Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (see [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss) and [Table 6](#c0107n00048)) is a once weekly GLP-1 administered by subcutaneous injection. It was shown to be effective in reducing weight in patients living with obesity, with or without diabetes.​[[42]](#Wadden2021)​[[43]](#Wilding2021)​[[44]](#Davies2021) Randomized trials comparing effectiveness of semaglutide with liraglutide as well as network meta-analyses suggest that semaglutide is superior to liraglutide in inducing weight loss.​[[46]](#Rubino2021)​[[47]](#Rubino2022)​[[48]](#Oneil2018)​[[49]](#Pratley2019) ​[[50]](#Shi2022) In clinical trials, semaglutide and liraglutide had similar rates of adverse effects and safety profiles.​[[47]](#Rubino2022)​[[48]](#Oneil2018)​[[49]](#Pratley2019) ​[[50]](#Shi2022) Of note, use of GLP-1 agonists has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, bowel obstruction and gastroparesis when compared with naltrexone/bupropion; however, the absolute risk increase remains low.​[[51]](#Sodhi2023)

**Table 5:** Pharmacotherapy for Weight Loss

**Abbreviations:**

MASLD
:   metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease

### Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg weekly (see [Table 5](#PharmacotherapyForWeightLoss)) is a dual action glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist currently Health Canada–approved only for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition to enhancing GLP-1 anorexigenic effects centrally, GIP is thought to act peripherally by targeting adipose tissues​[[52]](#Samms2020) and therefore increasing weight loss while also potentially having positive effects on obesity-related conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; previously called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease).​[[53]](#Targher2023) Once-weekly injections were shown to be effective in reducing weight in patients with obesity, with or without diabetes.​[[54]](#Jastreboff2022)​[[55]](#Lin2023)​[[56]](#Cai2024)​[[57]](#Pan2024) Tirzepatide has a safety profile similar to that of GLP-1 agonists, with side effects including GI events.​[[55]](#Lin2023)

As of June 2024, tirzepatide has not been approved for the treatment of obesity in Canada.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Obesity and Pregnancy

Obesity during pregnancy has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, birth defects, cesarean delivery, fetal macrosomia, perinatal deaths, postpartum anemia and childhood obesity in offspring.​[[61]](#c0107n00114)

Recent guidelines recommend that preconceptional and interconceptional counselling be made available to all patients of reproductive age to raise awareness of possible pregnancy complications associated with obesity and how to prevent them.​[[62]](#c0107n00165)​[[63]](#c0107n00115)

### Prepregnancy Considerations

Adipose tissue is critical in controlling the regulation of estrogen production and the concentration of sex hormone–binding globulin in the blood. Body weight and composition play an important role in pubertal maturation, whereby excessive weight gain at younger ages is associated with earlier menarche and menstrual problems including amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and long menstrual cycles.​[[64]](#c0107n00116) Obesity is a strong risk factor for polycystic ovarian syndrome, which results in menstrual irregularities and chronic anovulation. In the United States, 25% of ovulatory infertility may be attributable to obesity and being overweight.​[[65]](#c0107n00117)

Menstrual functioning, ovulation and fertility improve with weight loss. In patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, as little as a 5% reduction in weight has been associated with improved fertility.​[[66]](#c0107n00118) Maintaining this weight loss may prove challenging for patients of childbearing age. Restrained eating, dieting or weight cycling prior to pregnancy have been associated with gaining more weight during pregnancy.

Bariatric surgery for patients with severe obesity has been associated with better outcomes in the patient and the child.​[[67]](#c0107n00177) However, due to the possibility of nutritional deficiencies for both the patient and child, those who have undergone bariatric surgery are advised to delay pregnancy for 1–2 years.​[[31]](#c0107n00151) Patients becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery are advised to seek care from an obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies.

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

### Maternal Complications during Pregnancy

During pregnancy, patients with obesity are at increased risk for GDM and preeclampsia​[[62]](#c0107n00165) and should be screened for glucose intolerance early in prenatal care. Tight glucose control in patients with GDM seems to reduce the risk for preeclampsia.

### Maternal Complications in the Peripartum Period

Cesarean deliveries and associated morbidities are more common among those who have obesity.​[[62]](#c0107n00165) Patients who have excess weight or obesity have more postoperative complications following cesarean delivery.​[[62]](#c0107n00165)​[[68]](#c0107n00187) These include wound infection/breakdown, excessive blood loss, deep venous thrombophlebitis and postpartum endometritis. Labour is also longer in patients who have excess weight or obesity.

### Birth Outcomes

Congenital anomalies are more common in infants born to those who have obesity. Neural tube defects are approximately twice as frequent, with spina bifida being more common than anencephaly. Other birth defects that can occur more frequently include oral clefts, heart anomalies, hydrocephaly and abdominal wall abnormalities. Obesity has been found to be a risk factor for intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth.​[[69]](#c0107n00119)

### Management

During pregnancy, all patients classifying as having excess weight or obesity should be informed about current gestational weight gain target goals, but also advised to not lose weight during pregnancy. It is recommended that they gain no more than 5–9.1 kg (11–20 lb) during pregnancy if they are classified as having obesity.​[[70]](#refitem-1222161-507DCE21) They should be counselled about eating healthfully and encouraged to be physically active. Pharmacotherapy for weight management is not recommended.​[[1]](#OCguidelines2020)

### Obesity and Breastfeeding

Decreased rates of breastfeeding may be associated with excess weight or obesity,​[[63]](#c0107n00115) which raises concern, as breastfeeding has been associated with reduced development of obesity later in life. A high BMI before conception has been shown to be inversely related to the successful initiation of breastfeeding, the duration of lactation and the amount of milk produced. Having excess weight or obesity adversely affects lactation performance in a variety of ways.​[[63]](#c0107n00115) There are mechanical difficulties associated with latching on and proper positioning of the infant. The high cesarean section rates among this subpopulation delays the onset of first suckling. If first suckling occurs ≥48 hours after delivery, prolactin response will be lower, which may compromise milk production and over time lead to early cessation of lactation.

Patients classified as having excess weight or obesity should be encouraged to breastfeed as well as eat healthfully and engage in regular exercise. It is unlikely that orlistat is transferred into breast milk since only traces are absorbed orally.​[[71]](#c0107n00178) However, the drug can cause vitamin deficiencies, which may be undesirable in breastfeeding patients and is therefore not recommended. Limited evidence suggests that bupropion is transferred into breast milk in very small amounts and unlikely to cause side effects in breastfed infants;​[[72]](#c0107n00179) however, there are 2 case reports of possible seizure in breastfed infants where the patients were taking bupropion. No data is currently available on the use of GLP-1 agonists during breastfeeding. However, because liraglutide and semaglutide are large protein molecules, they are likely to be transferred into breast milk in very small amounts and would be destroyed in the infants GI track.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Obesity is a chronic disease—focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term interventions.
- High genetic risk for obesity does not imply that weight cannot be managed, but may make management more difficult. Improved adherence to healthy dietary patterns long term can negate the genetic association with weight gain, as demonstrated in 2 large cohort studies evaluated over a 20-year period.​[[73]](#refitem-1192163-4CD7D36F)
- Identify psychosocial, emotional and physical barriers—addressing these may be required before obesity treatment is initiated.
- Focus on improvements in health and quality of life, not on changes in body weight.
- Exercise is not the best way to lose weight, but can reduce visceral fat, increase cardiovascular fitness and help with weight maintenance.
- Prepare the patient for the weight-loss plateau; managing expectations is an important part of obesity management.
- Several oral pharmacologic agents are in the pipeline for the treatment of obesity, notably oral semaglutide​[[74]](#Knop2023) and orforglipron.​[[75]](#Wharton2023) Oral medications may be preferred by some patients and can therefore be an alternative to injectables.​[[76]](#Donnan2022)
