CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Just over 62 000 Canadians were believed to be living with HIV infection at the end of 2018,​[[1]](#Haddad) and a further 2122 new infections were diagnosed in 2019.​[[1]](#Haddad) Health Canada’s surveillance data indicate that the prevalence of new HIV infections for 2021 was 11.3% higher than in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced demand for and ability to provide services related to sexually transmitted and bloodborne infections (STBBIs), including HIV testing, suggesting that this may not reflect the true rate of new infections.​[[2]](#PHAC-85EB9865) Modern use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) has improved the prognosis of HIV infection, which is now regarded as a chronic, manageable condition. However, increased efforts are needed to prevent new infections from occurring.

HIV is transmissible through exposure to the virus via sexual or blood-borne routes, as well as during pregnancy and childbirth and via breastfeeding if the birthing parent has an uncontrolled HIV infection. ARVs have been demonstrated to prevent new HIV infections in 4 ways:

- The administration of ARVs to an individual living with an HIV infection in order to achieve an undetectable viral load and prevent transmission of the infection to their sex partner(s); this is called “Treatment as Prevention.”
- The administration of ARVs to a pregnant person living with HIV infection in order to suppress that person’s viral load and reduce the risk of transmission of the infection to the baby during pregnancy and childbirth. For more information, see “Choices during Pregnancy” in HIV Infection: Treatment.
- The administration of ARVs to a non-infected individual who is at high risk or has an ongoing risk of acquiring HIV; this is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). ARVs are given prior to and continued after potential exposures.
- The administration of ARVs to individuals shortly after they have been exposed to HIV in order to reduce the risk of developing HIV infection; this is known as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
  - When ARVs are used following an exposure in the workplace (e.g., a needle-stick injury), it is referred to as occupational PEP.
  - When ARVs are used following an exposure that happens as result of sexual activity or injection drug use, it is referred to as nonoccupational PEP (nPEP).

This chapter focuses on pre- and postexposure prophylaxis. Guidelines exist that provide advice for the use of PrEP, PEP and nPEP, including how to determine who should receive ARVs and which ARV regimens are recommended in each setting.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)​[[4]](#CDC-USD-2021)​[[5]](#CDC-USDHHSi-85EBF48F)​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955) Decisions about whether prophylaxis is indicated in each situation are based on the likelihood of transmission considering both the exposure type and the likelihood that the source person has transmissible HIV infection.

### Goals of Therapy

- Assess the risk of and prevent HIV transmission
- Provide safe and effective ARV prophylaxis

### Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis

### Introduction

ARVs can reduce the risk of HIV transmission when taken by individuals before they have exposure to the virus. This is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Canadian guidelines indicate that PrEP should be offered to individuals who are at high risk or have ongoing risk of contracting HIV.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187) In the United States, the 2021 CDC guidelines recommend that all clinicians talk to their sexually active patients about PrEP at least once.​[[4]](#CDC-USD-2021)

PrEP should not be used for someone who is known to be HIV positive and should not be started in someone with signs/symptoms of acute HIV infection or with a probable recent exposure to HIV until a new infection is ruled out. These individuals should be assessed for a new HIV infection and if diagnosed, should receive treatment for HIV infection (see HIV Infection: Treatment).

### Investigations​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)​[[4]](#CDC-USD-2021)​[[7]](#CDC-USDHHS-85EBE0C6)

- Clinical history to assess HIV risk and candidacy for PrEP:

  - Sexual history, including gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual behaviours, drug use, multiple (or new) partners, use of condoms.
  - Substance use, including sharing drug use equipment and use of drugs during sex, e.g., methamphetamines.
  - History of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) within the past 6–12 months.
  - Prior use of nPEP.

- Physical exam:

  - Signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection, e.g., fever, rash, joint pain, oral ulcers, fatigue, night sweats, sore throat, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, loss of appetite.
  - Signs or symptoms of any STIs (for more information, see Sexually Transmitted Infections).

- Baseline laboratory tests to rule out pre-existing HIV infection and evaluate PrEP candidacy:

  - HIV testing: HIV-negative status must be confirmed shortly before starting PrEP; use of a fourth-generation combination antibody/antigen assay is preferred. If the start of PrEP is delayed (e.g., >2 wk) for any reason following an initial negative test, retesting may be warranted prior to starting treatment in order to rule out pre-existing infection or recent seroconversion. If acute HIV infection is suspected, repeat the HIV test 7–21 days later (or use an HIV RNA nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT], if available) and defer PrEP until test results are received.
  - STIs: serology for syphilis; screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea (by urine NAAT plus throat and rectal swabs for culture or NAAT, as indicated based on sexual exposure). Treat any identified infections.
  - Hepatitis A, B and C: serologies should be verified at baseline (i.e., hepatitis A antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen, surface antibody and core antibody; and hepatitis C antibody). Offer vaccination against hepatitis A and B if nonimmune.

    For patients with hepatitis B or C infection: hepatitis infection is not a contraindication to the use of PrEP. However, since the medications used for PrEP (emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide [AF], tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DF]) are active against hepatitis B infection, liver function should be monitored for reactivation of hepatitis B infection when PrEP is discontinued. PrEP medications are not active against hepatitis C. Patients with viral hepatitis should be monitored and assessed for hepatitis treatment by an experienced health-care provider.
  - Renal monitoring: serum creatinine and urinalysis should be performed at baseline to rule out pre-existing renal impairment. PrEP should not be used if CrCL is <30 mL/minute, and tenofovir DF should not be administered if CrCl is <60 mL/minute.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)
  - Pregnancy screening: for all persons of child-bearing potential.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- HIV prevention services including risk-reduction counselling, condoms, regular HIV testing and STI testing should be offered to all individuals.
- PrEP provides protection against HIV infection only; thus, regular use of condoms is recommended to prevent other STIs as well as pregnancy. Evidence suggests there may be an increased rate of STIs among some PrEP users;​[[8]](#TraegerMW-19B6CF6B) therefore, regular testing and screening for STIs is recommended for all individuals.
- Proven harm-reduction strategies for people who use injection drugs should be offered, such as access to clean needles and injection works, as well as opioid agonist therapy.
- Many people at risk of HIV infection may be at risk for comorbid mental health disorders and substance use and may have social challenges, e.g., unstable housing or food or financial insecurity. Mental health screening with appropriate management and social support should be offered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy.​[[9]](#Appendix1-TanDHS-85EC6422)

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Risk Assessment​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)

- To conduct a risk assessment effectively, clinicians should aim to create a safe space where people feel comfortable discussing their sexual practices, while recognizing that not everyone will feel comfortable doing so. Clinicians should be mindful that an individual’s risk may change unexpectedly due to circumstances; therefore, a targeted risk assessment approach may underestimate actual risk. For this reason, recent guidance suggests that individuals who ask for PrEP should receive it, even in the absence of specific reported risk factors.​[[4]](#CDC-USD-2021)​[[10]](#Calabrese-85EC8C1F)​[[11]](#AAHM_PrEP)
- For individuals who do not ask for PrEP, an assessment to determine their ongoing risk of acquiring HIV may be useful to inform who should be offered PrEP. Risk of HIV transmission is dependent on 2 factors: the type of exposure (see [Table 1](#RiskOfInfection)) and the likelihood that the source person (sexual partner) has uncontrolled HIV infection (see [Table 2](#RiskCategories)).
- PrEP is *not* recommended when the risk of infection is negligible or none. This includes situations where the exposure risk is low and when the likelihood of the source having uncontrolled HIV infection is negligible or none.

  *Note:* when a sexual partner has known HIV infection and is taking ARVs with an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months, the risk of HIV transmission is considered none/zero.​[[12]](#Partner1)​[[13]](#RodgerAJ)​[[14]](#Bavinton) This concept is referred to as “Undetectable=Untransmittable,” or U=U. In these situations, PrEP is not indicated for the uninfected person, provided the 2 people are sexually monogamous.
- PrEP is recommended in the following cases:​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)

  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) or transgender women who report engaging in condomless anal intercourse in the past 6 months and who have any of the following:​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)​[[9]](#Appendix1-TanDHS-85EC6422)

    - infectious syphilis or rectal bacterial STI(s)
    - recurrent use of nPEP
    - ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-positive person with substantial risk of transmissible HIV (see [Table 2](#RiskCategories))
  - People engaging in heterosexual sex with partner(s) who have HIV infection and a substantial or low (but not negligible/none) risk of having transmissible HIV and there is reported condomless vaginal or anal intercourse.
  - People who inject drugs (PWID) if they are sharing drug use paraphernalia with a person who has a non-negligible risk of HIV infection or if they meet criteria based on sexual risk listed above.

### First-Line PrEP Therapy

In Canada, there are 2 medications approved for PrEP: emtricitabine/​tenofovir DF and emtricitabine/​tenofovir AF. Each of these is a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) coformulated into 1 tablet, which is normally taken daily for PrEP.

When taken on a daily basis with excellent adherence, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of HIV transmission among MSM and transgender women​[[15]](#GrantRM-85ECD920)​[[16]](#McCormackS-85ECFFD0)​[[17]](#GrantRM2-85ED1AB2) and in heterosexual men and women.​[[18]](#BaetenJM-85ED46DF)​[[19]](#ThigpenMC-85ED5E74) However, efficacy greatly depends on level of adherence and the population studied (e.g., lower efficacy in women, people who use drugs); in clinical trials, overall efficacy varied from 44–86% among MSM and transgender women to up to 100% among MSM with high adherence.​[[15]](#GrantRM-85ECD920)​[[16]](#McCormackS-85ECFFD0)​[[17]](#GrantRM2-85ED1AB2) Modelling studies suggest that based on the previous U.S. CDC criteria​[[5]](#CDC-USDHHSi-85EBF48F) for PrEP use (which is similar to Canadian criteria), approximately 25 MSM would need to take PrEP to prevent 1 new HIV infection.​[[20]](#JennessSM-19B96F14) Women may be more at risk of PrEP failure with missed doses due to pharmacokinetic differences in drug absorption and distribution to vaginal tissue.​[[21]](#CottrellML-85ED7B9B) In all patients, adherence must be assessed and supported at each follow-up visit to optimize effectiveness.

Daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir AF has also been approved for PrEP, except for those at risk due to receptive vaginal intercourse (due to lack of data). The DISCOVER trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of emtricitabine/tenofovir AF in comparison to emtricitabine/tenofovir DF for daily oral PrEP in MSM and transgender women.​​[[22]](#Hare-85EDD33A) Tenofovir AF is associated with less renal and bone toxicity compared with tenofovir DF when used for HIV treatment, though evidence suggests this is not as significant a concern for either drug when used for PrEP. Furthermore, it has an improved pharmacokinetic profile, making it an attractive option for PrEP from both a safety and efficacy standpoint. However, weight gain has been a reported adverse effect for PrEP, and it is more costly than generic emtricitabine/tenofovir DF.

Patients who initiate PrEP should be assessed for efficacy and safety at 1 month, 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter. Tolerability is very good, though some people experience a “start-up syndrome” consisting of headache, nausea and/or flatulence, which typically resolves within 1 month of starting therapy. While reduced bone mineral density has been reported with tenofovir DF, routine DEXA monitoring is not indicated in PrEP unless there is a history of pathologic or fragility fractures or significant risk factors for osteoporosis, in which case tenofovir AF might be a preferable option.

PrEP prescriptions should not exceed a 90-day supply, as it is critical to confirm a continued HIV negative status before continuing therapy to avoid missing a new HIV infection. HIV testing (in addition to testing for other STIs) must be performed every 3 months (see [Investigations](#Investigations_1)). If an individual tests positive for HIV or presents with signs or symptoms consistent with an acute HIV infection, PrEP must be discontinued immediately to prevent development of drug resistance, and the patient should be assessed for appropriate HIV treatment.

At each follow-up visit, individuals should be asked about tolerability and adherence to PrEP, and the use of harm-reduction strategies should be reinforced (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#nonpharms_1)).

### Off-Label and Investigative PrEP Therapy

### On-Demand PrEP Therapy

An alternative to daily oral PrEP is “on-demand” PrEP, which consists of taking 2 tablets of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF 2–24 hours before first sexual exposure, followed by 1 pill daily until 48 hours after the last sexual activity.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187) On-demand PrEP was demonstrated to reduce HIV transmission by 86% in MSM in the IPERGAY study.​[[23]](#MolinaJM-85EDECC8) Frequency of PrEP use among these study participants suggested they engaged in sexual activity at least weekly; extrapolating these results to individuals who engage in less frequent sexual activity or those in other risk groups is uncertain. On-demand PrEP is an off-label use of emtricitabine/TDF in Canada and should be viewed as an alternative recommendation due to the lower quality of evidence to support its use.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187) Emtricitabine/tenofovir AF is not recommended for on-demand dosing.

### Long-Acting PrEP Therapy

Long-acting medications are under investigation for PrEP, including a long-acting cabotegravir IM injection, twice-yearly lenacapavir SC injection, a dapivirine intravaginal ring, an islatravir monthly oral capsule and a subdermal implant. Clinical studies investigating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of these options are ongoing.

Cabotegravir has been found to be superior to daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in MSM and transgender women who have sex with men (66% reduction in HIV infection),​[[24]](#Landovitz-Cabo) and in cisgender women who have sex with men (89% reduction, though total infections in this study were low).​[[25]](#HPTN084) Cabotegravir has not yet been approved for PrEP in Canada; however, it is approved for this indication in the United States.​[[26]](#FDAAppro-43686EBC) Approved U.S. dosing consists of 600 mg IM injection administered monthly for the first 2 months (after an optional oral lead-in), followed by 600 mg IM every 2 months thereafter.​[[27]](#MedLetter_cabo)

### Follow-Up and Monitoring Assessment for Patients on PrEP

- Consider follow-up at 30 days to assess PrEP tolerability and adherence and to address any questions or concerns.
- PrEP prescriptions should never exceed 90 days; regular follow-up must occur every 3 months while on PrEP to identify any PrEP failures, recent seroconversion and safety/appropriateness of continued PrEP, as follows:

  - Clinical assessment: symptoms of HIV seroconversion, adherence to PrEP, any drug coverage issues, ongoing indication to continue PrEP, behavioural risk-reduction strategies.
  - HIV testing: must be repeated every 3 months while on PrEP, along with evaluation for signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection that may have occurred within the previous 12 weeks. Delay provision of PrEP refill prescriptions if HIV testing is not completed or acute HIV infection is suspected. The risk of continuing PrEP if the patient has contracted HIV infection is that 2-drug PrEP is insufficient to treat HIV infection and could lead to development of ARV resistance.
  - Renal monitoring: serum creatinine should be reassessed 30 days after starting PrEP, then every 3 months while on tenofovir DF-based PrEP to monitor for renal impairment.
  - Pregnancy screening: every 3 months, as appropriate.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)
- STIs: reiterate importance of regular condom use to prevent STIs and pregnancy, as appropriate. Screening for syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea should be performed every 3 months.
- Hepatitis C antibody (and hepatitis B screen, if non-immune): repeat annually.

### Discontinuing PrEP

When the decision is made to discontinue daily oral PrEP, it is not clear how long a person needs to keep taking medication after a potential exposure before it can be safely stopped. HIV protection decreases over 7–10 days following discontinuation of PrEP.​[[7]](#CDC-USDHHS-85EBE0C6) Guidelines suggest MSM with a long duration of PrEP adherence may require only 2 additional days of therapy following their last exposure.​[[9]](#Appendix1-TanDHS-85EC6422) However, in the absence of better evidence, individuals with other risks (e.g., PWID, women) may take PrEP for up to 28 days, based on extrapolation of data from PEP.​[[9]](#Appendix1-TanDHS-85EC6422)

The optimal timing for HIV testing following discontinuation of PrEP is unknown. Since PrEP may delay the detection of HIV antibodies, it is suggested that HIV testing at 8 weeks is reasonable.​[[9]](#Appendix1-TanDHS-85EC6422)

. . . . .

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, Occupational (PEP)

### Introduction

An occupational exposure to HIV can occur when there is a percutaneous injury (e.g., needle-stick, cut) or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with exposure to blood or other potentially infectious body fluid or tissue. Potentially infectious body fluids include pericardial, peritoneal, cerebrospinal and amniotic fluids, as well as any fluid that contains visible blood. Other body fluids (e.g., tears, urine, saliva, vomitus) are not infectious unless they contain visible blood.​[[28]](#BellDM-B64DDDCC) Occupational exposures occur most commonly among workers in health-care or laboratory settings, though workers in other environments (e.g., first responders in the community) may experience unintentional exposures to HIV.

The risk of acquiring HIV infection following an occupational exposure is quite low, approximately 0.3% following a percutaneous injury and about 0.09% for mucous membrane exposure.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955) Primary prevention of occupational exposures through application of universal precautions, use of personal protection equipment and following safety practices in the workplace is advocated. However, if a worker does experience a significant percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to a potentially infectious body fluid, PEP may be administered to prevent HIV infection. Due to their similar routes of transmission, workers should also be assessed for possible hepatitis B and C exposure with hepatitis B postexposure prophylaxis and monitoring as indicated in accordance with practice guidelines.​[[29]](#USPHS-B64DE0FA)​[[30]](#Schillie-B64DE60F)

### Investigations

- Follow workplace policy/protocols for management of occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens.
- Consider timing of the exposure. Occupational exposures are considered urgent medical concerns and should be treated immediately. When indicated, PEP should be initiated as soon as possible (i.e., within hours). Animal studies suggest PEP is most effective when administered within 72 hours, though extremely high-risk exposures may warrant PEP initiation even if a longer period of time has lapsed.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)
- If possible, assess the HIV status of the source person; however, do not delay initiation of PEP while awaiting test results. If the results later indicate the source is HIV-negative, PEP can be discontinued and no follow-up HIV testing for the exposed person is required.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)

  - If the source person is of unknown HIV status and provides consent for testing, administer a rapid point-of-care HIV screening test or laboratory-based test for HIV and screen for signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection.
  - If the source person is known to have HIV infection and provides consent, obtain an HIV viral load measurement and ARV drug and resistance history to guide selection of ARVs for PEP, if indicated. If the source person has a detectable viral load or has known ARV resistance, expert guidance on selection of an appropriate PEP regimen, taking into account known or anticipated resistance, is warranted.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)
- Baseline laboratory testing for the exposed person:

  - HIV testing: PEP is indicated only for potentially exposed individuals who do not have HIV infection; therefore, determination of HIV status at baseline is necessary. Testing with a fourth-generation combination antibody/antigen assay is preferred, though point-of-care HIV tests may be used, if available, in addition to standard testing.
  - Hepatitis B serology (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen, surface antibody, core antibody), hepatitis C serology (i.e., hepatitis C antibody) and alanine aminotransferase to assess for hepatitis.
  - Pregnancy testing, if appropriate.
  - Renal function (e.g., serum creatinine) and complete blood count (CBC) if PEP is being considered.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:

- The importance of using precautions (e.g., barrier method of contraception, avoid blood and tissue donation, defer pregnancy and breastfeeding, if possible) to prevent secondary transmission at least until the 3-month HIV test is confirmed as being negative.
- The importance of reporting signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection.
- Reassurance and psychological counselling, if necessary, as anxiety is common in occupational-exposure situations.

### Pharmacologic Choices

It is recommended that health-care institutions have a policy for managing occupational exposures to blood-borne pathogens, which addresses exposure to HIV and other blood-borne pathogens (such as viral hepatitis); maintain ARV starter kits consisting of a 3–5 day supply of medication in emergency departments to permit rapid initiation of PEP.

Selection of PEP medications is based primarily on tolerability and convenience (e.g., number of doses per day, number of pills per dose) to optimize adherence. If the exposed person has underlying renal or hepatic issues or is taking other medications, consideration should be given to the safety, dosage adjustment requirements and drug interaction potential with PEP medications (see [Table 5](#dt-hivPrevention1)). PEP should be prescribed for 28 days.

There is a lack of evidence to demonstrate superiority of 3 drugs over 2 drugs for PEP, or for superior efficacy of one PEP regimen over another. Three-drug PEP regimens, consisting of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) plus a third ARV medication (e.g., integrase inhibitor [INSTI], protease inhibitor [PI] or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) are recommended based on extrapolation of efficacy in treatment of HIV infection and because newer ARV medications are well-tolerated and associated with low risk for serious toxicity.

The 3-drug PEP regimen recommended by practice guidelines for occupational exposures is emtricitabine/tenofovir DF plus raltegravir (an INSTI); alternative regimens are listed in [Table 3](#OccPEPTable). However, since the guidelines were last updated (in 2013), newer, better tolerated and/or more convenient ARV agents have become available, which have replaced older ARVs in some hospital PEP protocols. For example, some hospitals are using dolutegravir in place of raltegravir as part of their first-line regimen.

Drug interactions between PIs or NNRTIs and other medications are common and should be assessed in individuals who are taking other medications. Despite this, PI–based regimens may be preferred in cases where the source person is known to be HIV-positive and drug resistance is a concern. A single-tablet, once-daily regimen consisting of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is an alternative with lower pill burden; however, drug interactions are also common with this regimen due to cobicistat, which is a cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor. In cases where drug resistance or renal impairment are a concern, consultation with an HIV expert or specialist is recommended.

**Table 3:** Options for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Following Occupational Exposure (PEP)​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)

| Therapeutic Regimens | Select Regimen | Two Drugs from N[t]RTI Class | Plusa Third Drug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preferred regimen | Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Truvada, generics) once daily | Dolutegravir (Tivicay)​ [a] once daily Raltegravir (Isentress) twice daily (or once daily if high-dose formulation) |
| Alternative regimens | Lamivudine (3TC, generics) plus tenofovir DF (Viread, generics) once daily Lamivudine/zidovudine (Combivir, generics) twice daily; may be administered separately in renal impairment | Atazanavir (Reyataz, generics) boosted with ritonavir (Norvir) once daily Darunavir (Prezista) boosted with ritonavir (Norvir) once daily Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) once daily Etravirine (Intelence) twice daily Rilpivirine (Edurant) once daily |
| Single-tablet alternative regimen | Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Stribild) once daily |

[a] This recommendation is based on expert opinion and *not* guidelines since dolutegravir was not available when this guideline was published (in 2013).

**Abbreviations:**

### Follow-Up and Monitoring for Patients on PEP

Institutional occupational health guidelines for PEP follow-up should be followed where available.

Re-evaluate exposed person within 72 hours of exposure to assess tolerability of PEP and consider HIV test results of source person, if available, to adjust PEP as necessary.

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:

- The importance of adherence and completion of the full 28-day course of PEP.
- The possible side effects and drug interactions associated with a PEP regimen and how to manage symptoms if they occur.

Follow-up testing and assessment for the exposed person:

- Assess for signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, rash, joint pain, oral ulcers, fatigue, night sweats, sore throat, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, loss of appetite) within 2–12 weeks of exposure.
- Whether PEP is administered or not, repeat testing for HIV should be performed at 6 weeks and at 3 months. Hepatitis B and C serology should be repeated at 6 months.
- If PEP is administered and baseline lab results were abnormal or person is symptomatic, repeat serum creatinine and CBC in 2 weeks.

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, Non-Occupational (nPEP)

### Introduction

Non-occupational exposures to HIV typically occur through sexual activity or injection drug use. nPEP may be provided to individuals who experience a moderate or high-risk non-occupational exposure (see [Table 1](#RiskOfInfection)) to prevent HIV infection.

### Investigations​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)​[[5]](#CDC-USDHHSi-85EBF48F)

- Clinical history to assess nature of the exposure:

  - Determine the type of exposure (see [Table 1](#RiskOfInfection)) and the timing of the exposure; nPEP is indicated if the exposure occurred within 72 hours and should be started as soon as possible.
  - Distinguish between consensual and non-consensual exposure; sexual assault support services should be offered if needed.
  - Determine whether the person has taken nPEP previously; repeated courses of nPEP may indicate ongoing risk and an indication for PrEP (following the management of the current exposure).

- If possible, assess the HIV status of the source person. However, do not delay initiation of nPEP while awaiting test results. If the results later indicate the source is HIV-negative, nPEP can be discontinued and no follow-up HIV testing for the exposed person is required.

  - If the source person is of unknown HIV status and provides consent for testing, administer a rapid point-of-care HIV screening test or laboratory-based test for HIV and screen for signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection.
  - If the source person is known to have HIV infection and provides consent, obtain an HIV viral load measurement and ARV drug and resistance history to guide selection of ARVs for nPEP, if indicated.
  - If the source person is currently taking ARVs and has had an undetectable HIV viral load for at least 6 months, nPEP is not indicated, as the risk of transmission is none/zero.​[[12]](#Partner1)​[[13]](#RodgerAJ)​[[14]](#Bavinton) If the source person has a detectable viral load or has known ARV resistance, expert guidance on selection of an appropriate nPEP regimen, taking into account known or anticipated resistance, is warranted.
  - If the source person is unknown or does not provide consent for HIV testing, consider likelihood of HIV infection based on epidemiologic factors (see [Table 2](#RiskCategories)).

- Baseline laboratory testing for the exposed person:

  - HIV testing: nPEP is indicated only for potentially exposed individuals who do not have HIV infection; therefore, determination of HIV status at baseline is necessary. Testing with a fourth-generation combination antibody/antigen assay is preferred, though point-of-care HIV tests may be used, if available, in addition to standard testing. Do not delay start of nPEP to await results of baseline HIV test. nPEP should be discontinued if the HIV test is positive, with immediate referral to an HIV care provider for appropriate treatment.
  - Hepatitis B serology (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen, surface antibody, core antibody), hepatitis C serology (i.e., hepatitis C antibody) and alanine aminotransferase to assess for hepatitis.
  - Test for other STIs if exposure was due to a sexual encounter. Obtain serology for syphilis; urine NAAT plus throat and rectal swabs for culture or NAAT for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
  - Pregnancy testing, if appropriate.
  - Renal function (e.g., serum creatinine) and complete blood count (CBC) if nPEP is being considered.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:

- The importance of using precautions (e.g., using condoms and harm-reduction strategies for PWID, avoiding blood and tissue donation, deferring pregnancy and breastfeeding, if possible) to prevent secondary transmission at least until the 3-month HIV test is confirmed as being negative.
- The importance of reporting signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection.

### Pharmacologic Choices

nPEP is indicated for HIV-negative persons who present within 72 hours of having a moderate- or high-risk exposure (see [Table 1](#RiskOfInfection)) if the source person has a non-negligible risk of HIV infection (see [Table 2](#RiskCategories)). nPEP should be initiated within 72 hours of the exposure (ideally within 24 hours) or as soon as possible. nPEP is not normally indicated when the risk of transmission is low or if the source person has known HIV infection but is taking ARVs and has an undetectable HIV viral load, as there would be zero risk of transmission in this situation.

nPEP should be taken for 28 days and should be stopped early only if the source is found to be HIV-negative or is HIV-positive with an undetectable HIV viral load due to effective ARVs. Individuals should be supported for optimal adherence to complete the full 28 days of therapy and encouraged to report any adverse effects so they can be managed or have their nPEP therapy switched if necessary.

A variety of 3-drug nPEP regimens can be considered. There is no evidence to suggest one regimen is superior to another, so selection is based on tolerability, cost, drug interaction potential and patient preference. Therapeutic options for nPEP can be found in [Table 4](#nPEPTable). Regimens should consist of 2 N[t]RTIs plus a third ARV medication; first-line options include:​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)

- N[t]RTI options: Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is the preferred N[t]RTI combination in most nPEP regimens unless there is renal impairment (CrCl <60 mL/min) or other contraindications.
- Third drug options:

  - Dolutegravir can be taken once daily, is well-tolerated and has low potential for drug-interactions. However, as it is a relatively new medication, there is less evidence for its use in nPEP.
  - Raltegravir is well-tolerated and has low potential for drug interactions; however, it usually requires twice-daily dosing, which may be inconvenient. The once-daily high-dose formulation of raltegravir is recommended as an alternative regimen for nPEP.
  - Darunavir plus ritonavir may be administered once daily, is well-tolerated and may be preferred in cases where the source person has known HIV infection with a drug-resistant virus. This regimen should be taken with food and has a high potential for drug interactions, especially with medications that affect or are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system or P-glycoprotein.

**Table 4:** Options for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Following Non-Occupational Exposure (nPEP)​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)

| Therapeutic Regimens | Select Regimen | Two Drugs from N[t]RTI Class | Plusa Third Drug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preferred regimen | Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Truvada, generics) once daily | Darunavir (Prezista) boosted with ritonavir (Norvir) once daily Dolutegravir (Tivicay) once daily Raltegravir (Isentress) twice daily |
| Alternative regimens | Lamivudine (3TC, generics) plus tenofovir DF (Viread, generics) once daily Lamivudine/zidovudine (Combivir, generics) twice daily: may be administered separately in renal impairment | Atazanavir (Reyataz, generics) boosted with ritonavir (Norvir) once daily Darunavir/cobicistat (Prezcobix) once daily Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) once daily Raltegravir HD (Isentress HD) once daily |
| Single-tablet alternative regimen | Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Stribild) once daily |

**Abbreviations**

tenofovir DF
:   tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

### Follow-Up and Monitoring for Patients on nPEP

Re-evaluate exposed person within 72 hours of exposure to assess tolerability of nPEP, and consider HIV test results of source person, if available, to adjust nPEP as necessary.

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:

- The importance of adherence and completion of a full 28-day course of nPEP.
- The possible side effects and drug interactions associated with the nPEP regimen and how to manage symptoms if they occur.

Follow-up testing and assessment for the exposed person:

- Assess for signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, rash, joint pain, oral ulcers, fatigue, night sweats, sore throat, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, loss of appetite) and any STIs within 2–12 weeks of exposure.
- Whether nPEP is administered or not, repeat testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and STIs (in the case of sexual exposure) should be performed at 3 months. If hepatitis C infection was acquired as result of the exposure, HIV testing should be repeated again at 6 months due to the risk of delayed HIV seroconversion.
- If indicated, repeat pregnancy testing at 4 weeks.
- If nPEP is administered and baseline lab results were abnormal or person is symptomatic, repeat serum creatinine and CBC in 2 weeks.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

When a pregnant person experiences a possible exposure to HIV or has ongoing high risk of exposure, a full discussion of the risks and benefits of (n)PEP or PrEP is warranted during shared decision-making. The risk of HIV transmission from birthing parent to child is very high if the birthing parent experiences an acute HIV infection during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[[31]](#LockmanS-85EE541F) Because risk factors may be under-reported, PrEP should be offered to those who feel they may be at risk of HIV acquisition.​[[32]](#AIDSInfo-85EFA8A5) The CDC guidelines include guidance for use of PrEP for people considering becoming pregnant, during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​[[4]](#CDC-USD-2021) For more information, see “Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding” in HIV Infection: Treatment.

### Choices during Pregnancy

Risks associated with the use of antiretroviral medications during pregnancy depend on the duration of exposure, timing during pregnancy and which medications are used. Product labelling indicates emtricitabine/tenofovir DF can be used during pregnancy at standard doses.​[[33]](#TruvadaCPhAPM)

Data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry indicates no increased risk of birth defects among infants born to HIV-infected person who took dolutegravir, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, raltegravir or ritonavir-boosted darunavir during pregnancy.​[[34]](#AntiretroviralPregnancyRegistry-85EF0B74)

Elvitegravir/cobicistat should not be used due to potential subtherapeutic drug levels during pregnancy with standard dosing.​[[32]](#AIDSInfo-85EFA8A5)

There is limited data on pregnancy outcomes among people who used PrEP; however, clinical trial data evaluating emtricitabine and tenofovir DF suggest no evidence of increased risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, congenital malformations or infant mortality.​[[35]](#MugoNR-85EEEE4D) If PrEP is utilized in pregnancy, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is recommended and patients should be reminded that excellent adherence is essential in order for it to be effective.​[[32]](#AIDSInfo-85EFA8A5)

For PEP, preferred regimens during pregnancy include emtricitabine/tenofovir DF plus either dolutegravir 50 mg once daily, raltegravir 400 mg BID or darunavir 800 mg (boosted with ritonavir 100 mg) once daily:

- No dosage adjustments are required for emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in pregnancy.
- Raltegravir is well-tolerated in pregnancy, though it must be dosed twice daily due to the lack of data on the use of the once-daily high-dose raltegravir formulation in pregnancy.​[[32]](#AIDSInfo-85EFA8A5)
- Ritonavir-boosted darunavir is recommended to be dosed twice daily to treat HIV infection during pregnancy;​[[32]](#AIDSInfo-85EFA8A5) however, Canadian guidelines suggest once-daily dosing is sufficient for nPEP due to the lower viral burden in the setting of PEP (versus established HIV infection) and based on favourable pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)
- Lamivudine/zidovudine may be used in place of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in pregnancy.

### Choices during Breastfeeding

The risk of HIV transmission from birthing parent to child is very high if the patient experiences an acute HIV infection during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[[31]](#LockmanS-85EE541F) Breastfeeding is not normally recommended for HIV-positive individuals in Canada, even if the patient is on effective antiretroviral therapy, due to the lack of evidence regarding the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk in patients with an undetectable viral load. Discussions regarding the use of PrEP or (n)PEP in those who are breastfeeding should compare the risk of the individual contracting HIV infection (if they do not take PrEP or (n)PEP) and the risks to the baby (potential toxicity due to antiretroviral medication exposure through breast milk; risk of HIV transmission through breast milk if the person seroconverts while breastfeeding). In some cases where (n)PEP is being considered, cessation of breastfeeding may be warranted.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)

While the product monograph does not recommend emtricitabine/tenofovir DF use during breastfeeding,​[[33]](#TruvadaCPhAPM) Canadian guidelines suggest that PrEP may be used in those who are breastfeeding where benefits outweigh the risks.​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187)

It is unknown whether raltegravir and darunavir are transferred into breast milk.​[[36]](#LactMed-8F34132B) Emtricitabine and tenofovir DF are both transferred into breast milk at low to moderate levels.​[[36]](#LactMed-8F34132B)

Canadian guidelines recommend against breastfeeding if nPEP is required,​[[3]](#TanDHS-85EBA187) while other guidelines suggest breastfeeding should not be a contraindication to PEP when needed, though the risks and benefits to the baby should be discussed with the person who is breastfeeding to ensure informed shared decision-making.​[[6]](#KuharD-85EC2955)

### Therapeutic Tips

- For many reasons (e.g., stigma, fear, access to care, gendered power dynamics), some individuals (e.g., women, Black patients) may be insufficiently addressed by current PrEP guidelines. Clinicians should exercise clinical discretion and consider relevant contextual information about the individual presenting for care to ensure equitable access to preventative care.​[[37]](#Nelson)
- Transgender persons are at a disproportionately increased risk of HIV infection due to the intersectionality of social and structural factors, and should be considered for PrEP based on their individual risk.​[[38]](#CDC-4369F4F5) Discussion of sexual risk should include type of sexual activity, as different body parts respond differently to PrEP (e.g., anal vs. genital/vaginal intercourse) and levels of adherence for effective prevention varies accordingly as well. Health-care providers should offer support as needed and be aware that transgender persons may have increased barriers to PrEP access and adherence due to stigma and discrimination and limited access to supportive health care. Trans Care BC has developed a useful [resource](https://www.transcarebc.ca/sites/default/files/2024-03/HIV_PrEP_Considerations.pdf) to assist in these conversations.
- Remind individuals on PrEP that it is effective against HIV only and does not provide protection against other STIs; therefore, condoms are still recommended.
- Adherence support is important to ensure optimal efficacy of PrEP and PEP. Individuals who repeatedly miss doses of PrEP should be reminded of the importance of behavioural risk-prevention strategies.
- For patients with hepatitis B infection, monitor for reactivation and flares of hepatic disease following discontinuation of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, whether used for PrEP or (n)PEP, and assess whether there is need for ongoing hepatitis B treatment.
- PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV transmission, yet it is not widely used. Patients may not disclose behaviours that place them at risk of infection, so health-care providers should routinely assess sexual risk and use of illicit substances in a nonjudgmental manner and offer PrEP when indicated.
- PrEP may be considered for adolescents at risk, though special considerations including establishing therapeutic partnerships and supporting adherence through more frequent follow-up are warranted. Clinical considerations for PrEP use among adolescents have been published.​[[39]](#TannerM19C39555)
- Individuals who repeatedly seek nPEP should be offered PrEP. PrEP can be initiated immediately following completion of their 28-day course of nPEP. Failure to immediately transition to PrEP may increase their risk of infection and requires a new baseline assessment to rule out HIV infection before starting PrEP.
