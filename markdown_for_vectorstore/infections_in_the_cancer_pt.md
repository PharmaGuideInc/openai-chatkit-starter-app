### Introduction

Infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients despite the progress in their recognition, therapy and prevention. The ever-expanding armamentarium of antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy and immunotherapy has produced a positive impact on survival rates in cancer patients. However, this has also rendered patients more susceptible to infections because of prolonged immune dysfunction associated with this improved survival.

### Goals of Therapy

- Decrease morbidity associated with infection
- Minimize risk of death from infection
- Enhance the supportive care and quality of life of cancer patients by using prophylactic measures to prevent infection while adhering to antibiotic stewardship principles and reducing adverse events
- Utilize outpatient antimicrobial management appropriately to facilitate care, to prevent or reduce length of hospital stay, and to enhance the quality of life for cancer patients

### Investigations

- Thorough history with attention to:

  - history of significant infections, drug allergy or sensitivity, including nature of reaction(s)
  - the nature of the malignancy and associated defects in host defenses, e.g., neutropenia, B-cell and/or T-cell dysfunction
  - the impact on host defenses of cytotoxic, myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive therapy employed to treat the patient’s cancer; note the day of fever onset relative to the first day of the most recent cycle of chemotherapy
  - neutropenia (severity and expected duration) as the depth and duration of neutropenia are the main predisposing factors for infection
  - iatrogenic procedures performed on the patient, e.g., splenectomy, placement of venous access devices or other surgical procedures
  - whether the nature of the malignancy suggests obstruction of natural body passages, e.g., bronchus, bowel, ureter, biliary tree
  - CNS dysfunction, e.g., changes in cranial nerve function, strength, coordination, stance and gait, sensation, and mental status
  - occupational and travel history, and exposure to animals
- Complete physical examination with particular attention to venous access sites, wounds, skin, mouth, pharynx, sinuses, chest, rectum and other possible sites of infection; note any localizing signs of possible infection, e.g., shortness of breath, localized pain, facial or extremity swelling, mental status changes, seizures, or weakness of an extremity indicating a CNS infection
- Laboratory tests:

  - CBC and differential to assess the absolute neutrophil count
  - biochemical profile with attention to renal and liver function
  - at least 2 sets of blood cultures; ensure blood cultures are done from peripheral site as well as all lumens of venous access devices
  - culture of any other suspected site of infection, e.g., urine, skin, sputum
  - radiographic studies appropriate for suspected sites of infection, e.g., chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest for pneumonia, CT scan of the abdomen for an intra-abdominal focus of infection, CT or MRI of the extremities for potential infection involving these areas, CT scan or MRI of the head for encephalitis, meningitis or cerebral abscess
  - stool for Clostridioides difficile and other potential pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella* spp., *Shigella* spp., *Campylobacter* spp., viruses and protozoa) if diarrhea is present (note that immune therapy–related colitis can cause diarrhea)
  - serological or quantitative PCR tests (serology, antigen or nucleic acid amplification tests for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, *Cryptococcus* spp., Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis, human herpes viruses, respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and *Toxoplasma* spp.), if indicated
  - when appropriate, biopsy for pathology and culture of skin lesions and other potential sources (sinuses, nose, lung and gastrointestinal [GI] tract) suspected to be infectious

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Environmental precautions are important to prevent infection in cancer patients.

- Standard infection control measures, especially handwashing, are of particular importance in immunocompromised patients.
- Special air handling, including high-efficiency particulate filtration rooms, is mandatory for profoundly neutropenic patients at high risk for filamentous fungal infections.
- Use specialized infection control procedures (contact precautions) for patients colonized or infected with multidrug resistant organisms, e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, *Candida auris* and C. difficile.
- Use droplet precautions for respiratory viral illnesses.
- Use airborne precautions for varicella-zoster infections and those patients suspected of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infections.
- Avoid fresh flowers and plants in rooms of neutropenic patients. The evidence for the restriction of certain food types (raw fruits and vegetables, raw eggs, aged cheese, etc.) in a low-bacterial diet is conflicting.​[[1]](#VanDalenECMankALeclercgEEtAl.LowBac-30EF20B7)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Antimicrobials (antibacterials, antifungals and antivirals) used to treat infections in cancer patients are presented in [Table 1](#c0103n00021), [Table 2](#c0103n09090) and [Table 3](#c0103n09091).

Although neoplasms can cause fever in cancer patients, seek an infectious etiology in all cases of elevated temperature. *Fever* is defined as a single oral temperature ≥38.3°C or a temperature of ≥38°C for a ≥1-hour period in the absence of obvious environmental causes.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)

*Neutropenia* is defined as a neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 10​9/L. A more profound degree of neutropenia (<0.1 × 10​9/L) confers a much greater risk of developing more severe infection. In addition, the risk of infection is directly related to the duration of neutropenia. Lower risk of infection is present in patients with neutropenia of ≤7 days whereas higher-risk patients are those with neutropenia >7 days’ duration. Because of the high risk of life-threatening bacterial infection and the inability to reliably distinguish patients with bacterial infection from noninfected patients at presentation (particularly in neutropenic patients), initiate prompt empiric IV antibiotic therapy to cover the potential pathogens.​[[2]](#c0103n00491) However, in most patients, the etiology of the infectious episode remains unknown.

Most infections are caused by microorganisms that have colonized the patient at or near the site of infection, e.g., the skin, oropharynx, GI tract, lungs or genitourinary tract. Bacteria are the principal pathogens causing infections in cancer patients, representing >60% of initially documented episodes of infection.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)

### Antibacterial Therapy

The choice of antibacterial agents in febrile cancer patients is predicated on the neutrophil count, the patient’s clinical status, the site of infection and local microorganism susceptibilities, with particular attention to prevalent multidrug resistant organisms such as MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing organisms and carbapenem-resistant organisms (see [Figure 1](#c0103n00004)).

In selecting the initial antibiotic regimen and the site of care (inpatient or outpatient setting) consider:​[[3]](#c0103n00023)​[[4]](#c0103n00024)​[[5]](#c0103n00492)​[[6]](#c0103n1002)​[[7]](#c0103n00025)

- Concurrent comorbid medical illnesses (e.g., heart failure, COPD, renal disease, liver disease, bleeding disorders)
- The control of the patient’s cancer
- The presence of serious medical complications

Outpatient antibiotic therapy may be employed not only for non-neutropenic patients, but also for low-risk neutropenic patients who do not have the aforementioned medical conditions or uncontrolled cancer (see [Figure 2](#c0103n00005)). Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy that ensures adequate coverage for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms is necessary for febrile neutropenic patients.

Monotherapy with an IV broad-spectrum antipseudomonal beta-lactam (ceftazidime, imipenem/​cilastatin, meropenem or piperacillin/​tazobactam) is suitable for the treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes. A 2007 meta-analysis found cefepime monotherapy may be associated with higher all-cause mortality compared with other beta-lactams;​[[8]](#c0103n00495) however, a subsequent meta-analysis found no association with increased mortality.​[[9]](#c0103n00518)

Vancomycin may be incorporated into the initial therapeutic regimen for patients with suspected venous access catheter–related infection, positive blood cultures for gram-positive bacteria in groups or chains, severe mucositis, known colonization with MRSA, or hypotension or other evidence of cardiovascular impairment.​[[2]](#c0103n00491) Alternatively, vancomycin may be added later to the initial broad-spectrum regimen if none of the aforementioned infection conditions are present and fever is persistent. Once susceptibility testing for the infecting organism has been completed, vancomycin should be discontinued if the infecting organism is shown to be susceptible to other antibiotics or if no vancomycin-susceptible organism is recovered.​[[10]](#PaulMDicksteinYBorokSEtAl.Empirical-24B002BC)

Linezolid or daptomycin may be required for MRSA and/or VRE infections.

Metronidazole or clindamycin may be used as part of the initial antibiotic regimen for presumed anaerobic infection related to the GI tract or skin provided that antianaerobic activity is not already included in the initially selected regimen, e.g., beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination or a carbapenem.

The duration of antibacterial therapy is determined as follows:

- In neutropenic patients, continuation of antibacterial therapy until patients are no longer neutropenic (neutrophils ≥0.5 × 10​9/L) and are afebrile for ≥48 hours is one accepted approach. An alternative approach may involve early discontinuation of IV broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy if the patient is afebrile for >72 hours and clinically stable. This strategy of antimicrobial stewardship attempts to offset antibiotic resistance and unwanted antibiotic-related side effects.​[[11]](#VerlindenAJansensHGoossensHEtAl.Saf-8DE61899) For patients with microbiologically or clinically documented infection, continue broad spectrum antibacterial therapy for a minimum of 10–14 days and until patients are afebrile and no longer neutropenic (neutrophils ≥0.5 × 10​9/L) for ≥48 hours.
- In non-neutropenic cancer patients with a suspected bacterial infection, continue antibiotic therapy for approximately 7 days and until the patient is afebrile for ≥48 hours. Alternatively, switch from IV antibiotic therapy to oral therapy to complete an appropriate course of therapy directed toward the site that is infected.
- In patients who are persistently febrile and neutropenic after 4–7 days of appropriate antibacterial therapy, reassess and consider antifungal therapy as outlined below.

### Antifungal Therapy

Parenteral antifungal therapy should be initiated for documented invasive or disseminated fungal infection in non-neutropenic and neutropenic cancer patients.

Treatment of a proven, probable or possible invasive fungal infection in a neutropenic patient requires parenteral antifungal therapy with amphotericin B compounds, caspofungin or IV or oral voriconazole.​[[12]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDEtAl.Clinic-252AAF41)​[[13]](#WalshTJTepplerHDonowitzGREtAl.Caspo-3108D1C9) Voriconazole or caspofungin (for invasive aspergillosis) are preferred in patients with renal dysfunction.​[[14]](#PattersonThomasF.EtAl.PracticeGuide-24B1461C) When creatinine clearance is <50 mL/min, oral voriconazole may be preferred over IV voriconazole due to accumulation of the IV vehicle in renal dysfunction.

The amphotericin B lipid preparations have equivalent efficacy but produce less nephrotoxicity and infusion reactions than conventional **amphotericin B deoxycholate**. They may be used in patients with fungal infections who fail to respond to amphotericin B deoxycholate or for patients with documented or potential amphotericin B intolerance or toxicity (particularly nephrotoxicity).​[[15]](#c0103n00026)

Posaconazole, also available in oral and IV formulations, may be used for refractory invasive fungal infections or in patients intolerant to other medications.​[[16]](#c0103n00431)

**Candida**

Caspofungin, micafungin or anidulafungin may effectively treat candidemia in neutropenic or non-neutropenic patients.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)​[[17]](#c0103n00494) In non-neutropenic patients who are not critically ill, fluconazole may be used for candidemia for susceptible organisms.​[[12]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDEtAl.Clinic-252AAF41)

Non-neutropenic patients who develop oral candidiasis may be treated with a topical agent such as nystatin. However, esophageal candidiasis should be treated with systemic oral agents such as fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole or voriconazole. Patients with extensive lesions may require parenteral therapy with fluconazole, an amphotericin B formulation, voriconazole, caspofungin or micafungin.​[[12]](#PappasPGKauffmanCAAndesDEtAl.Clinic-252AAF41)

**Aspergillus**

Voriconazole, available both in oral and IV formulations, conferred superior efficacy and survival compared with amphotericin B for primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis;​[[18]](#c0103n00027) it has better activity against infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. It is the preferred agent for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.​[[14]](#PattersonThomasF.EtAl.PracticeGuide-24B1461C)

Itraconazole, which is available only in an oral formulation, has enhanced activity against Aspergillus spp. compared with fluconazole and is an alternative for oral step-down therapy after parenteral treatment for invasive aspergillosis.

Isavuconazole, available in both oral and IV formulations, has been demonstrated to be equally efficacious in treating aspergillosis compared to voriconazole but produces less hepatotoxicity than voriconazole.​[[19]](#Maertens-3E4058AA)

Amphotericin B lipid preparations are an alternative to voriconazole for the treatment of documented invasive aspergillosis. Caspofungin may be considered as second-line therapy for refractory cases of invasive aspergillosis. For recalcitrant infections, voriconazole may be used in combination with anidulafungin or caspofungin, or a lipid-based formulation of amphotericin B may be used.​[[20]](#c0103n00330)​[[21]](#c0103n00514)

### Antiviral Therapy

There is no indication for the empiric use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of cancer patients without evidence of viral disease.​[[2]](#c0103n00491) Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir are the mainstay of therapy for susceptible influenza virus causing respiratory tract infections in cancer patients.

Skin or mucous membrane lesions due to herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus may be treated with oral or IV acyclovir. Oral famciclovir or valacyclovir are better absorbed from the GI tract than acyclovir, and are alternatives.​[[22]](#c0103n00028) IV foscarnet is indicated for acyclovir-resistant herpesvirus infections in immunocompromised patients.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in bone marrow transplant recipients may be treated with ganciclovir IV, or with valganciclovir when oral therapy is desirable. Maribavir or IV **foscarnet** may be used for documented ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV.

### Supportive Care Measures

Both IV remdesivir and oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be used to treat COVID-19 in cancer patients.​[[23]](#imCompCovid)

**Granulocyte (G-CSF)** and **granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs)** (e.g., filgrastim, pegfilgrastim) may decrease the incidence and duration of neutropenia after chemotherapy for patients with lymphomas or solid tumors who are at higher risk of developing febrile neutropenic complications after chemotherapy.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)​[[24]](#c0103n00496) They are recommended as adjunctive treatment of febrile neutropenia for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. They may also be considered for patients who remain profoundly neutropenic with documented infection such as pneumonia, severe cellulitis or sinusitis; however, colony-stimulating factors in combination with antimicrobials do not improve mortality.​[[25]](#MhaskarRClarkOALymanGEtAl.Colonyx20-251C669D) Once neutrophil counts reach ≥0.5 × 10​9/L, colony-stimulating factor support should be discontinued.

Primary prophylaxis with a G-CSF may also be utilized starting with the first cycle and continuing through subsequent cycles of chemotherapy in patients who have an approximately 20% or higher risk for febrile neutropenia based on patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors. G-CSF prophylaxis may also be administered in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy such as in breast cancer treatment.​[[24]](#c0103n00496)

### Prevention of Infection in Cancer Patients

For cancer patients with pronounced T-cell dysfunction produced either by ≥20mg/day of prednisone for at least 28 days or the use of purine analogues, prophylaxis with oral sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim is recommended to prevent *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia.​[[26]](#SternAGreenHPaulMEtAl.ProphylaxisFo-251E3944) Alternative prophylactic agents are inhaled pentamidine, atovaquone and dapsone.

Strategies designed to prevent bacterial infection in profoundly neutropenic cancer patients, such as those with acute leukemia, focus on eliminating resident microflora and preventing acquisition of new potential pathogens. Potential antibiotic regimens are fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim or orally nonabsorbable antibiotics (gentamicin, vancomycin and nystatin). Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin significantly decrease febrile morbidity, bacterial infections and mortality for patients with acute leukemia and those undergoing bone marrow transplantation.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)​[[27]](#Gafter-GviliAFraserAPaulMEtAl.Antib-251C67DC) Prophylaxis during the expected period of neutropenia in the first month of chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma (levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 7 days) also reduces the rate of febrile episodes.​[[28]](#c0103n00432) There may be a predilection for gram-positive infection when ciprofloxacin is used prophylactically. This may be overcome by adding another antibiotic with good activity against gram-positive organisms, e.g., a penicillin or a macrolide;​[[29]](#c0103n00031) however, this practice is not currently recommended in international guidelines.​[[2]](#c0103n00491)

Antifungal prophylaxis with oral fluconazole effectively prevents invasive fungal infection in patients who develop profound and prolonged neutropenia (>7 days) such as allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and in patients with acute leukemia who are undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy.​[[30]](#c0103n00327)​[[31]](#c0103n00328) If fluconazole has been used prophylactically, it should not be used empirically or for documented fungal infections in neutropenic cancer patients. For these situations, a parenteral amphotericin B formulation​[[2]](#c0103n00491) or caspofungin​[[13]](#WalshTJTepplerHDonowitzGREtAl.Caspo-3108D1C9) are the drugs of choice; however, voriconazole is the drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis.

Itraconazole prophylaxis may be preferred for individuals at greater risk of developing invasive aspergillosis, such as allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients being treated for graft-versus-host disease with immunosuppressive therapy.

Posaconazole is as effective as fluconazole in preventing all invasive fungal infections, but is superior for prevention of invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease.​[[32]](#c0103n00434) In patients with acute leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy, posaconazole is more effective than both fluconazole and itraconazole for prevention of invasive fungal infections.​[[33]](#c0103n00435)​[[34]](#c0103n00520)

Micafungin is effective as prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients.​[[35]](#c0103n00433)

Antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir should be used to prevent herpes virus infections in patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy as well as patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation.

Letermovir may be employed to prevent post-transplant CMV infections in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who are cytomegalovirus seropositive.​[[36]](#MartyFMLjungmanPChemalyRFEtAl.Leter-6E2DAC1C)

### Vaccination of Cancer Patients

Cancer patients are considered to be immunocompromised and as a result should not receive live vaccines during periods of immunosuppression.​[[37]](#c0103n00516)​[[38]](#c0103n00517) Furthermore, live vaccines should be administered ≥4 weeks prior to immunosuppression. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to immunosuppression. For more information related to vaccination in patients with cancer, see the [Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG): Part 3—Vaccination of Specific Populations, Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-8-immunization-immunocompromised-persons.html).

The magnitude and duration of immune response to vaccinations may be diminished in immunosuppressed cancer patients.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Avoid aminoglycosides in patients with impaired renal function, particularly those receiving treatment with other nephrotoxic drugs such as cisplatin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B or vancomycin.
- In deciding on cost-effective empiric therapy, drug acquisition costs by themselves are of limited value. Also consider the relative effectiveness, side effect profile and overall resource consumption of the available treatments.
- Combination therapy for febrile neutropenia with a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside is associated with more adverse events (e.g., a higher incidence of nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity) than monotherapy with a beta-lactam.
- Identification of low-risk patients appropriate for outpatient antibiotic management may enhance the patient’s quality of life and reduce costs.

[b] The extended-interval regimen (high-dose, once-daily administration) is thought to be associated with less toxicity. However, for patients with uncertain or impaired renal function, some clinicians prefer to use the conventional dosing method (daily dose divided Q8H) because of more experience with this regimen in this population. Whichever regimen is used, serum levels and renal function should be monitored and the dose and/or interval should be adjusted accordingly.

[c] These agents are listed on Public Health Agency of Canada’s “[Reserve list for antimicrobial drugs](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/antibiotic-antimicrobial-resistance/reserve-list-antimicrobial-drugs.html)” and should be used only when resistance has been established or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated.
