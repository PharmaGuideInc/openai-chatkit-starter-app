### Introduction

Pharyngitis is one of several upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that is caused by different viruses or bacteria and presents with common symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise to varying degrees. This chapter focuses on viral pharyngitis and its symptomatic management.

Chapters with information about other URTIs include:

- Acute Rhinosinusitis: see Acute Rhinosinusitis
- COVID-19: see COVID-19
- Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis: for bacterial pharyngitis, see Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis
- Influenza: see Influenza
- Viral Rhinitis: see Viral Rhinitis

### Pathophysiology

### Pharyngitis

Acute pharyngitis is an inflammatory syndrome of the pharynx, which can present as pain, redness and swelling of the throat and, most often, symptoms of the common cold. Fever, swelling of the lymph nodes, joint pain or muscle aches are sometimes present. Many bacterial and viral organisms are capable of inducing pharyngitis, but the majority (50–80%) are viral.​[[1]](#Bisno)​[[2]](#Sykes) Pharyngitis may be present with allergic rhinitis, COVID-19, rhinosinusitis and gastric reflux. It may also be due to exposure to irritating substances or environmental pollutants, ingestion of caustic substances, or direct trauma to the pharynx. Pharyngitis can also be present as part of symptom complexes of other serious illnesses.

Infectious pharyngitis is commonly caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses are known to cause URTIs. Rhinovirus is the most common pathogen implicated in viral pharyngitis, accounting for about 20% of cases.​[[1]](#Bisno)​[[3]](#Wolford) Other causative viruses include adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza and parainfluenza. Less common causative viruses are coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex viruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus and HIV.​[[2]](#Sykes)​[[3]](#Wolford)

Among bacterial causes, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is by far the most implicated (15–30% of cases in children 5–15 years of age and 5–15% in adults).​[[4]](#RedBook_GAS)​[[5]](#Ashurst) Other common bacterial and fungal causes include *Chlamydia pneumoniae*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Candida*, *Neisseria meningitidis* and *N. gonorrhoeae*. Pharyngitis due to GABHS is usually seen during the winter and early spring. Impetigo, suppurative complications (peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis rhinosinusitis), rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may occur secondary to bacterial pharyngitis.​[[4]](#RedBook_GAS) Rheumatic fever is prevented by treatment of GABHS within 9 days of onset of the infection.​[[4]](#RedBook_GAS) For more information on bacterial pharyngitis, see Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce pain
- Alleviate other symptoms
- Minimize inflammation

*Note*: therapy for viral pharyngitis does not eradicate, shorten the duration of or prevent complications of infection. Most types of pharyngitis are self-limited and resolve in about 7–10 days. Therefore, therapy for viral pharyngitis focuses on symptom management. Patients should begin to feel relief within the first 24–48 hours, but symptoms may persist for up to 10 days.

### Patient Assessment

Determine symptoms, duration and risk factors for serious disease. See Figure 1 and Assessment of Patients with Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Assessment of Patients with Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms for an assessment algorithm and summary of the differentiating characteristics of URTIs.

A sore throat is common to many URTIs and usually does not require specific treatment. Symptoms suggestive of GABHS include sore throat with a sudden onset, fever and headache. Nasal congestion, conjunctivitis and cough are not generally suggestive of bacterial pharyngitis.​[[6]](#Shulman)​[[7]](#approa) A modified Centor score can be used to help determine the likelihood of GABHS and therefore the need for antibiotic treatment;​[[8]](#McIsaac2004)​[[9]](#McIsaac1998) for more information on the Centor score, see Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis.

A sore throat that presents with severe symptoms or compromises the airways requires immediate medical attention. Patients with epiglottitis may initially complain of sore throat and odynophagia, but this can rapidly evolve into a life-threatening situation. Symptoms of epiglottitis include trouble swallowing, significant drooling, laryngeal/voice findings (e.g., muffled, hoarse, croaky or husky), stridor, increased breathing rate, improved comfort by leaning forward, anxiousness and even panic. Ludwig angina, a severe cellulitis of the floor of the mouth, is another medical emergency that is suggested by severe halitosis, drooling, pain or tenderness, or difficulty breathing. A chronic or recurrent sore throat should undergo further investigation for other causes including cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, environmental irritants, allergies and HIV.

### Prevention

Upper respiratory tract viruses are transmitted by direct contact (hand-to-hand), aerosol particles or contact with settled droplets. Not touching the face and eyes can help prevent transmission of infection. Routine handwashing is also recommended.​[[10]](#Heikkinen)​[[11]](#Jefferson) Proper handwashing technique is described in Sore Throat from a Viral Infection—What You Need to Know at the conclusion of this chapter.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are widely used in health-care settings or in situations when water is not available; however, they may be of limited value for preventing spread of respiratory infections.​[[12]](#Aiello)​[[13]](#Wong) Handwashing remains the first and most important step for cleaning hands, especially if they are visibly soiled. Hand sanitizers may be used as a supplement to regular, effective handwashing when water is not readily available and when hands are not visibly soiled.

Sneeze and cough etiquette is another method traditionally advised for the prevention of URTIs. This involves coughing or sneezing into the arm, sleeve or tissue. If a tissue is used, it should be promptly thrown away and the hands washed.​[[14]](#PHAC2009) Utilizing a mask for preventing transmission or exposure to pathogens may be considered for persons with upper respiratory tract symptoms, those who may be at higher risk of complications (immunocompromised, pregnancy, older adults, young children) or those in increased transmission settings (i.e., crowded, poorly ventilated or prolonged close contact).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For pharyngitis, nonpharmacologic treatment consists of bed rest, good hydration and increased humidity (>50%).

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Symptomatic management should be the main goal of therapy in viral pharyngitis. The pain associated with pharyngitis (e.g., sore throat, fever, myalgia) may be eased with systemic (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) or local analgesics (e.g., benzocaine, dyclonine hydrochloride, phenol). Local analgesics (anesthetics) are available as lozenges, sprays and gargles and provide short-term relief (30–45 min). ASA should not be used in children and adolescents with viral illnesses due to its association with Reye syndrome. Methemoglobinemia is an uncommon but serious adverse effect that has been reported with the use of benzocaine applied to the oral mucosa.​[[15]](#HC2006) Some lozenges contain antiseptics (e.g., cetylpyridinium, dequalinium); however, there is no evidence of benefit, particularly since most cases of pharyngitis are viral. Nonmedicated lozenges may reduce the discomfort of a sore throat by their demulcent effect on the throat and their ability to increase salivation. Topical treatments should not be recommended if severe pain upon swallowing and dysphagia is present. Abrupt closure/spasm of the epiglottis leading to death has been reported with their use in the presence of epiglottitis.​[[16]](#FedRegist)

Antihistamines, antitussives and short-term decongestants can also be used to alleviate other symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections (e.g., sneezing, post-nasal drip, nasal congestion, dry cough); for more information see Acute Cough and Viral Rhinitis.

Antibiotic therapy for viral pharyngitis is inappropriate and should be avoided. Antibiotics are not indicated for viral infections because they are not active against viruses. Antibiotics do not alleviate symptoms or eradicate, shorten the duration of or prevent complications of viral infections. In addition to not being effective for viral infections, antibiotics expose patients to several risks such as increased risk of antibiotic resistance, drug-related adverse events, disruption of the normal microbiota and risk of a superinfection (such as *C. difficile* or yeast infection). Patient awareness of when it is appropriate to ask for antibiotics is important; health-care professionals play a significant role in patient education regarding this issue. If bacterial pharyngitis is suspected, see Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis.

### Echinacea

*Echinacea* is hypothesized to stimulate the immune system and is widely used to prevent and treat the common cold and other respiratory infections.​[[17]](#pscvrn1039) Three species of echinacea are available: *Echinacea angustifolia*, *E. purpurea* and *E. pallida*. Although *E. purpurea* is the most frequently studied, *E. angustifolia* is most commonly used in North America. Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of echinacea for this indication. Though it appears to be safe, evidence regarding its efficacy in treatment is inconclusive.​[[18]](#echinaceaSysMet)​[[19]](#pscvrn1042) There may be a role for echinacea in preventing URTIs and complications including tonsillitis/pharyngitis.​[[20]](#PrevEch)

The treatment dose that is commonly used is 1 g of *E. purpurea* TID, although appropriate evidence is lacking. Treatment begins at the first sign of symptoms and continues for at least 10–14 days.​[[17]](#pscvrn1039) The preventative dose is usually 300–500 mg TID. Echinacea is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are uncommon but have included allergy, nausea and dizziness, tingling of the tongue, and excessive salivation. Allergic cross-sensitivity can occur with members of the Asteraceae/Compositae family (e.g., ragweed); echinacea should be used with caution in atopic individuals.​[[21]](#pscvrn01109) It is contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients, including those with HIV and autoimmune diseases or those taking immunosuppressant medication. Safety in pregnancy or during breastfeeding has not been established.

### Considerations in Pediatric Populations

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used for relief of aches and pains or fever >38.5°C. Avoid ASA due to its association with Reye syndrome. See Fever for more information on the management of fever.

Nonprescription cough and cold remedies should be avoided in children <6 years of age.​[[22]](#Peterson)​[[23]](#HC2008) Since December 2008, Health Canada has required manufacturers to relabel nonprescription cough and cold medicines with certain active ingredients to indicate that they should not be used in children <6 years of age.​[[23]](#HC2008) Parents/caregivers can consult [Health Canada](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/index-eng.php) or the [Canadian Paediatric Society](https://caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/health-conditions-and-treatments/over_the_counter_drugs) websites for more information.

Ensure the child drinks plenty of clear fluids (e.g., water, diluted unsweetened fruit juice or clear soup) to prevent dehydration and keep the throat moist.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions.

### Monitoring of Therapy

**Table 1:** Monitoring of Therapy for Viral Pharyngitis

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sore throat | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: next visit or by telephone 2–3 days later | Patient able to perform daily activities. Patient able to sleep. | Optimize nonpharmacologic measures. Change treatment if not effective. |

### Advice for the Patient

Advise patients regarding:

- Nonpharmacologic therapy
- Proper use of medication
- Expected results and management of side effects
- Lack of efficacy of antibiotics against viral infections and potential to contribute to antimicrobial resistance with misuse/overuse
- When to contact a health-care provider
