### Introduction

Patients at the end of life are confronted with many troubling symptoms (see [Table 1](#c0118n00032)) requiring a team approach to care. This chapter provides management strategies for common symptoms in the last 48 hours of life; a discussion of the palliative care journey (>48 h of life) is outside the scope of this chapter. The therapies presented are recommended by experienced palliative care teams and can be used in the home setting.

**Table 1:** Symptoms at the End of Life​[[1]](#c0118n00034)[[2]](#c0118n96321)

| In the last1–2 weeks | In the last48 hours | Symptom | Incidence (%) | Symptom | Incidence (%) | Symptom | Incidence (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fatigue | 88 | Noisy and moist breathing | 56 | Dyspnea | 22 |
| Weight loss | 86 | Urinary dysfunction | 53 | Nausea and vomiting | 14 |
| Weakness | 74 | Pain | 51 | Sweating | 14 |
| Appetite loss | 56 | Restlessness and agitation | 42 | Jerking, twitching | 12 |

### Goals of Therapy

- Limit physical and emotional suffering by adequately managing pain and other symptoms
- Support the ability to enjoy remaining life while avoiding inappropriate prolongation of death

### Investigations

- History and physical exam to determine the nature and severity of symptoms
- Detailed medication history, including nonprescription medications, herbal remedies, vitamins and other natural therapies; having knowledge of the benefit of, or intolerance to, prior treatments can save time
- Minimal diagnostic testing helps to preserve quality of life; avoid invasive investigations when possible

### Therapeutic Choices

Certain principles are essential for optimal symptom management in the end-of-life setting:

- Any symptom is as distressing as a patient claims it to be.
- Treatment risks, benefits and alternatives need to be discussed in the context of the dying patient’s values, culture, goals and fears.
- Medication needs to be reviewed; the 3 general principles of prescribing at the end of life include:​[[3]](#c0118n98765)

  - stop nonessential drugs
  - convert essential drugs to parenteral route
  - use anticipatory prescribing
- Cause of symptoms is irrelevant and investigation is unneeded when disease is advanced and death very near, unless detection would direct a useful change in symptomatic treatment.

### Dyspnea

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Oxygen is a potent symbol of medical care that clearly has a role in the hypoxic patient.​[[4]](#c0118n00035) Carefully consider oxygen use in the hypoxic patient who thinks it will not be of benefit or the nonhypoxic patient who thinks it will; try oxygen therapy on a continuous or as-needed basis and ask the patient if it helps. Similarly, let the patient choose the flow rate. Sometimes a mask with compressed air flow provides a sense of security.
- Provide reassurance, information and support to the patient and family.
- Suggest relaxation therapies or breathing exercises and consider repositioning.
- Offer an electric fan for cool air flow to the face.
- Open a window; for bedbound patients, allow clear line of sight to the outside.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 3](#c0118n00029) lists drugs used in the treatment of dyspnea.

### Opioids

Oral and parenteral opioids are effective and recommended in the management of breathlessness in end-of-life care.​[[5]](#refitem-122213-0BDDAC38)​[[6]](#c0118n00171)​[[7]](#c0118n00172) The acute situation may require frequent parenteral dosing (e.g., morphine 5–10 mg SC or IV Q30 min until settled); otherwise, the usual dosing regimen involves Q4H dosing with Q1H breakthrough doses. Nebulized opioids should *not* be used, as there is no evidence for this treatment modality.​[[5]](#refitem-122213-0BDDAC38)​[[6]](#c0118n00171)​[[7]](#c0118n00172)

Intermittent dyspnea can be treated with intermittent opioids. If titrated to control dyspnea, opioids will not hasten death.​[[8]](#c0118n00176)

Sublingual fentanyl has been shown to be effective for breathlessness.​[[9]](#c0118n00173)​[[10]](#c0118n00174) Onset is quick but duration of effect is only about 40–60 minutes.​[[11]](#c0118n00103) Sublingual fentanyl tablets are available in Canada, but the lowest available dose is higher than the usual starting dose of fentanyl for this indication. Some palliative care protocols use the parenteral formulation sublingually; this option can be beneficial in the home setting when parenteral access may be limited.​[[12]](#c0118n00175) Patients need access to a home-care nurse or a pharmacy willing to prepare doses in advance.

### Nonopioids

**Benzodiazepines** such as clonazepam, lorazepam and midazolam have been widely used to manage dyspnea in the palliative care setting, possibly through relief of anxiety, despite a lack of strong evidence of efficacy.​[[13]](#c0118n00169) Though their use is not validated, benzodiazepines may provide improved control of dyspnea compared with opioids in terms of duration of action, potency and reduced adverse effects, especially in the absence of pain or when there is a clear component of anxiety.

Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) have a specific role in the management of dyspnea resulting from obstructive lesions, lymphangitic carcinomatosis or COPD exacerbations. CNS adverse effects may limit their utility.

### Pain

- Determine the cause. Differentiate nociceptive (somatic, visceral) from neuropathic (dysesthetic, neuralgic) pain to guide the choice of treatment (see Neuropathic Pain).
- Measure the pain intensity. Numeric rating scales that ask patients to grade their pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) are easy to use, reproducible and validated.​[[14]](#c0118n00179)​[[15]](#c0118n00180) Surveillance of restlessness, rigidity, grimacing, guarding and distressed vocalization is necessary in nonverbal patients.
- Review multidimensional aspects of pain. Assess response to, and adverse effects of, previously used analgesics as well as coping skills, past drug/alcohol overuse, concerns about addiction, metabolic abnormalities, cognitive impairment and finances.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic options include:

- Repositioning
- Application of heat/cold
- Relaxation techniques
- Relevant spiritual or cultural practices

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 3](#c0118n00029) lists drugs used in the treatment of pain.

A step-wise approach to pain management is mandated in all cases (see also Acute Pain and Neuropathic Pain). For mild pain, **nonopioid analgesics** can be tried (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs; see Acute Pain for dosing information) with or without an opioid; however, *mild* pain is rare in this setting. In the acute palliative care setting, opioids (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) are usually the mainstay of therapy (see Opioids (CPhA Monograph)).

- Titrate opioid doses gradually to achieve adequate pain control without opioid toxicity.
- Use Q4H dosing (PO/SC/IV/PR) for dose titration. The acute situation may require more frequent parenteral dosing, e.g., morphine 5–10 mg SC or IV Q30 minutes until settled.
- A breakthrough dose (estimated as 10% of the total 24-h dose) ordered as Q1H PRN allows for control of interdose pain and provides essential dosing information to help with opioid titration.
- Regularly review and adjust doses to a new Q4H dose:

  - new Q4H dose = (all Q4H + all PRN doses in previous 24 h / 6)
- There is no ceiling effect or maximum safe dose for opioids. Patients’ response to opioids can vary greatly, and doses in the hundreds of milligrams Q4H may be required. Side effects may be the limiting factor.
- Educate patients and caregivers about anticipated side effects of opioid use (see [Table 2](#c0118n00033)). Opioid-induced neurotoxicity (e.g., acute delirium, hallucinations, myoclonus, seizures, hyperalgesia, allodynia) can result from altered opioid metabolism (e.g., dehydration, renal failure) or from too rapid titration. It may respond to a dose reduction or, when possible, a correction of the altered metabolism. IV fluids are rarely indicated in the last 48 hours of life, and must be factored in carefully at this stage. Significant toxicity requires a switch to another opioid at 50–75% of the equianalgesic dose (see Opioids (CPhA Monograph), Table 6). Avoid meperidine, as its neurotoxic metabolite can accumulate in patients with reduced renal function, possibly causing seizures.

**Table 2:** Management of Adverse Effects of Opioids

| Category | Effects | Comments | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General | Nausea | Very common; tolerance develops in 2–3 days | Dimenhydrinate, metoclopramide or prochlorperazine PRN |
|  | Constipation | Very common; ongoing treatment is mandatory | Daily laxatives , e.g., polyethylene glycol + stimulant (see Constipation in Adults ) |
|  | Somnolence | Very common; tolerance develops in 2–3 days | Reassure patient |
|  | Pruritus | Less common | Antihistamines; may require a change of opioid |
|  | Dry mouth | Less common | Chew gum; suck on hard candy or ice chips; use saliva substitutes |
| Opioid-induced neurotoxicity | Myoclonus | More common in long-term use | May require change of opioid |
|  | Delirium | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |
|  | Hallucinations | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |
|  | Hyperalgesia | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |

Adjuvant drugs may be useful in specific pain syndromes, e.g., NSAIDs or corticosteroids for bone pain; tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. However, the introduction of adjuvant analgesics is rarely indicated in the last 48 hours of life. Continuation of previous therapy should be carefully reviewed.

### Nausea and Vomiting

Though less common in occurrence at the end of life, if present, nausea and vomiting can be a source of great distress. The investigation and treatment of reversible causes (e.g., hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, bowel obstruction) may not be reasonable at the very end of life.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- If patient eating, give smaller portions or snacks consisting of bland foods.
- Avoiding the smell and sight of food being cooked may be necessary.

### Pharmacologic Choices

- If occasional nausea or vomiting, initial trial of dimenhydrinate.
- If persistent nausea or if experiencing a bowel obstruction, low dose of subcutaneous haloperidol.
- If persistent vomiting and clearly not experiencing a bowel obstruction, scheduled doses of subcutaneous metoclopramide and monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms.
- Titrate doses upwards for response.
- If not responding to above measures, replace with 2–3 doses/day of SC methotrimeprazine.

See also Nausea and Vomiting.

### Terminal Delirium and Agitation

Patients often exhibit increasing confusion, drowsiness and/or restlessness and moaning during progressive multi-organ failure.

- Identify and eliminate reversible causes (e.g., dehydration, visual or hearing impairment),​[[16]](#c0118n00040) although this is rarely successful.
- Develop individualized approach and clear communication with health team, patient, family/caregivers for decisional approach to care, as the patient often lacks the decisional capacity.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Reassure and educate the caregivers about the possibility of delirium and agitation.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 3](#c0118n00029) lists drugs used in the treatment of delirium and agitation.

- Haloperidol is the mainstay of treatment for delirium, although there is evidence suggesting it may decrease survival and be less effective than individualized management of delirium precipitants and supportive strategies alone.​[[17]](#refitem-12221191-1091FA1A) If doses >10–15 mg/day are ineffective, consider more sedating agents such as the addition of midazolam to haloperidol or switching to methotrimeprazine alone or in combination with midazolam. Midazolam as a continuous infusion has also been used if necessary for refractory delirium.
- Growing evidence is showing that **second-generation antipsychotics** (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine) are as effective as haloperidol for treating delirium at the end of life while causing fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and more sedation.​[[18]](#c0118n98764)​[[19]](#c0118n98763) However, their use is limited due to unavailability of immediate-release injectable forms.
- Other **benzodiazepines** (e.g., clonazepam, lorazepam) should generally be avoided since they are known to worsen delirium in the end-of-life care setting, except in case of alcohol or sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, where they are first-line agents. They may also be useful in agitated patients with Parkinson disease or Lewy body dementia due to the increased risk of EPS with antipsychotics in this patient population.​[[20]](#c0118n98762)
- Palliative sedation: consider heavy sedation to render the patient unaware of a severe symptom (e.g., pain, dyspnea, restlessness, hemorrhage) when an usual intervention has not provided an acceptable level of comfort.​[[21]](#c0118n00182) Midazolam and methotrimeprazine are commonly used. Review the option with the patient and/or caregivers and explain that this usually involves cessation of nutrition and hydration.
- Never give opioids as sedatives.

### Respiratory Secretions

Pooling of pharyngeal and pulmonary secretions is common with decreased levels of consciousness causing inability to expectorate. This symptom (previously termed “death rattle”) is usually of no consequence to the patient but can be quite distressing to the caregivers.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Educate the caregivers that the patient is unaware of the distressful breathing sounds and it is not a source of suffering.
- Position patient semiprone if possible.
- If possible and not too distressing for the patient, use mouth swabs to remove secretions directly.

### Pharmacological Choices

[Table 3](#c0118n00029) lists drugs used in the treatment of respiratory secretions.

- No one drug has been found to be superior to any other and none have been found to be superior to placebo in established secretions. Prophylaxis to reduce secretions is an area of ongoing research.
- Scopolamine is the usual choice but is sedating.​[[22]](#VanEsch-28012AB7) To avoid sedation, glycopyrrolate may be given.​[[23]](#c0118n00042)

### Therapeutic Tips

- At the end of life, goals of care focus on achieving patient comfort. Discontinue interventions that do not play a role in supporting comfort, e.g., blood work, vital signs, blood glucose monitoring. Often the routine medical approach (e.g., IV fluid rehydration​[[24]](#c0118n00181)​[[25]](#DaviesA-27FC453C)) is best replaced by what truly keeps the patient comfortable (e.g., good mouth care to control thirst).
- Choose medications with the goal of providing comfort. Most medications used to treat chronic diseases (e.g., antianginal agents) rarely have a role at the end of life and should be discontinued. Opioids and medications with sedating properties are frequently required and their use should be guided solely by any ongoing need to control symptoms.
- Successful end-of-life care in the home requires 24-hour access to a supportive multidisciplinary team ready to deal rapidly with issues as they arise.
