### Introduction

Asthma is a respiratory disorder characterized by:

- Paroxysmal or persistent symptoms, e.g., dyspnea, chest tightness, wheeze, sputum production and cough
- Variable airflow limitation
- Airway inflammation
- Airway hyperresponsiveness

The 2023 version of the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA Asthma) report defines asthma as a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation resulting in airflow limitation. Patients typically present with a history of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. The symptoms vary over time and in intensity as the inflammation and airflow limitations worsen or improve.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)

GINA Asthma and the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) suggest the following targets for asthma control: occurrence of symptoms <3 days per week or use of reliever <3 doses per week.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021)

This chapter focuses on the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of asthma in adolescents and adults. For information regarding the treatment of asthma in patients who are 13–17 years of age and are unable independently to manage their asthma (i.e., require caregiver supervision), see Asthma in Infants and Children.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent asthma-related mortality
- Prevent exacerbations
- Maintain asthma control:​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021)

  - maintain normal activity levels, e.g., avoid absence from work or school, maintain ability to exercise without limitations
  - prevent daytime (e.g., cough, wheeze, dyspnea; goal: ≤twice/wk) and nocturnal symptoms (e.g., night waking; goal: none)
  - prevent need for reliever therapy (goal: ≤twice/wk)
- Provide optimal pharmacotherapy and avoid adverse effects

### Investigations

- Thorough history with particular attention to:

  - family history of asthma and atopy
  - symptoms: frequency, severity and timing (following possible trigger exposure, nighttime vs. daytime symptoms)
  - pattern of symptoms, e.g., seasonal, perennial, diurnal variation
  - precipitating factors, e.g., environmental allergens, occupational exposures, irritants such as smoke, drugs such as ASA or beta-blockers, preservatives such as sulfites, viral respiratory infections, exercise, rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, anxiety, depression
  - previous prednisone use, hospitalizations, emergency room visits and intensive-care admissions
- Physical examination:

  - wheeze, nasal polyps, nasal congestion, voice changes
  - absence of findings such as crepitations, unilateral wheeze, fingernail clubbing
- Objective measurements required to confirm diagnosis, assess severity and possibly predict treatment response include:

  - spirometry (preferred method of diagnosis): reduced expiratory flow rates with reversibility
  - home peak flow monitoring to diagnose asthma or to monitor patients with severe asthma or poor perception of airway obstruction
  - bronchoprovocation challenge test in lung function laboratories using methacholine or histamine, if diagnosis in doubt
  - office-based mannitol challenge testing; not yet available but may be in the future
  - other measurements to predict treatment response to certain agents; examples include blood eosinophil count (from CBC), FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide) and serum IgE. Sputum eosinophil counts may be used in specialized centres to monitor effectiveness of anti-inflammatory therapy and to guide dosage adjustments in individuals with moderate to severe asthma​[[2]](#CTS2021)​[[3]](#Petsky-05A3CEDD)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Advise patients to identify and avoid precipitating factors such as environmental allergens and occupational irritants.
- Smoking and vaping cessation, including substances other than tobacco, is essential (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation).​[[2]](#CTS2021)​[[4]](#c0038n00220) As well, patients should avoid exposure to second-hand smoke.
- Treat modifiable comorbidities, e.g., obesity (emphasize importance of proper nutrition, encourage weight loss both nonpharmacologically and pharmacologically, and encourage regular physical activity while advising on how to treat/reduce exercise-induced symptoms), chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, depression.
- Hyposensitization therapy to allergens should be considered as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy if there is clear evidence of a relationship between allergen exposure and persistent, suboptimally controlled, asthma symptoms (see [Immunotherapy](#topic-1103471-8A313B1F) for more information).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[5]](#NAEPP) Hyposensitization therapy should not be administered to patients with poorly controlled asthma. Severe, possibly fatal, reactions are more frequent within this patient population.​[[5]](#NAEPP)
- Although HEPA filters may reduce some allergen levels, the use of home air cleaners/purifiers is not otherwise supported by evidence.​[[6]](#c0038n00172)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Choose the initial level of treatment with medication after an assessment of asthma severity and previous treatment (see [Figure 1](#PharmMan-DCFD4A9F) and [Figure 2](#GINAAsess-DCFD4038)).​[[2]](#CTS2021) Review treatment every 3–6 months and, if control is achieved, try a stepwise reduction in treatment (see [Step-Up and Step-Down Therapy](#stepupstepdown-1103476-8AB173A3)).

The cornerstone of asthma management is inhaled therapy that maximizes delivery of drugs to the respiratory tract and minimizes systemic side effects. Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) with spacers, dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft-mist inhalers (SMIs) deliver drugs as effectively as nebulized therapy, making the use of regular nebulized medications unnecessary, as it takes much longer for patients and families to administer nebulized therapy. DPIs and SMIs may be preferable to pMDIs due to the effect of pMDIs on the environment; pMDIs utilize propellants (e.g., hydrofluorocarbons) for medication delivery, which are powerful greenhouse gases.​[[9]](#Wintemute-ABE0C6F7) The environmental impact of pMDIs may be reduced via recycling programs or disposal at the patient’s pharmacy using pharmaceutical waste bins to allow incineration and therefore destruction of the propellant.

Inhaled medications include bronchodilators (**short-acting** and **long-acting beta2-agonists** [**SABAs**, **LABAs**] and **short-acting** and **long-acting muscarinic antagonists** [**SAMAs**, **LAMAs**]) as well as anti-inflammatory agents (**inhaled corticosteroids** [**ICS**]). Other medications are available by the oral route, including anti-inflammatories (**corticosteroids**, **leukotriene receptor antagonists** [**LTRAs**]) and bronchodilators (**beta2-agonist**, **methylxanthines**, e.g., theophylline) or by injection, such as biologic therapies. For more information, see [Table 2](#c0038n00026). The foundation of asthma therapy should involve an ICS anti-inflammatory agent, which can be stepped up with additional therapies such as LABAs , LTRAs and LAMAs. Theophylline use is uncommon in North America, but is used in developing countries due to cost constraints.

The 2019 GINA Asthma recommendations brought about a paradigm shift in asthma therapy. They emphasize avoiding SABA monotherapy, driven by studies on as-needed ICS/LABA therapy for mild asthma.​[[10]](#SYGMA-1)​[[11]](#SYGMA-2) In particular, 1 study demonstrated the superiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol (an ICS/LABA combination product) over both as-needed SABA monotherapy and regular budesonide (an ICS) monotherapy in reducing severe exacerbations and glucocorticoid exposure in patients with mild asthma.​[[12]](#Beasley-8042D466) Additionally, SABA monotherapy has been associated with heightened risks of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[13]](#sabaOveruse) Consequently, the GINA recommendations suggest an ICS/formoterol combination (approved in Canada as the budesonide/​formoterol combination product) as *controller therapy* for all patients with asthma (daily for most patients; as-needed for those with infrequent symptoms) and as-needed, low-dose budesonide/formoterol *reliever therapy* (instead of a SABA) (see [Figure 1](#PharmMan-DCFD4A9F) for more information).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)

In Canada, the use of SABA monotherapy should be considered only in *very mild* asthma cases where the patient is at low risk of an asthma exacerbation (e.g., non-smoker; well-controlled asthma; use of ≤2 SABA inhalers per year; *and* no history of prior exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visit or hospitalization) and symptoms are currently well-controlled with rare use of SABAs (<2 times/wk).​[[2]](#CTS2021) Alternatively, the use of PRN ICS/formoterol or daily ICS + PRN SABA is also appropriate in these patients.​[[2]](#CTS2021)

### Inhaled Corticosteroids

Inhaled beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone **furoate**, **fluticasone propionate** and mometasone are safe, effective, and cost-effective drugs that treat the inflammatory component of asthma.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021) An as-needed ICS/LABA combination inhaler containing budesonide/​formoterol is the preferred therapy for mild asthma, providing patients with both reliever and controller activity. Alternatively, the GINA recommendations suggest a protocol having the patient take an ICS dose(s) whenever a SABA is used (i.e., also as needed). As asthma severity increases, as-needed low-dose ICS/formoterol is recommended for all patients as reliever therapy as well as daily low-dose ICS or ICS/LABA as controller therapy, depending on asthma severity (see [Figure 1](#PharmMan-DCFD4A9F)).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)

Inhaled corticosteroids have a higher ratio of topical to systemic activity than do oral corticosteroids. The incidence of pharyngeal candidiasis from deposition of the inhaled corticosteroid in the pharynx can be reduced by rinsing the mouth after use and/or using a spacer device. Dose equivalencies for ICS single-ingredient products are listed in [Table 1](#CStable).​[[14]](#CTS-SevereAsthma.-05B4F3D6) Beclomethasone dipropionate and ciclesonide are both prodrugs. Beclomethasone dipropionate has activity before and after activation. Ciclesonide is biologically inert until activated by esterases in the lung. It is inactive in the upper airway and may have fewer topical side effects such as thrush.​[[15]](#BatemanEDLinnhofAEHomikLEtAl.Compar-94F9D1CD)

### Short-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

As previously stated, monotherapy with a **short-acting beta2-agonist** (SABA; also known as a beta2-adrenergic agonist) is no longer recommended due to an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) SABAs (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) should be used only as a reliever therapy (“as-needed”) in combination with low-dose daily ICS controller therapy or if budesonide/formoterol reliever therapy is not appropriate (e.g., due to cost, drug plan coverage, inhaler technique, patient preference).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) Isoproterenol and epinephrine have been used in the past but are not recommended for the treatment of asthma because of lack of beta2-selectivity and potential for excessive cardiac stimulation, especially at high doses.

### Long-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

There are now a number of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) for treatment of asthma; they should be used *only* in patients already taking ICS. Adding LABAs to ICS may permit decreasing the dose of the ICS and also has been clearly shown to reduce the incidence of exacerbations to a greater extent in comparison with an increased dose of ICS without a LABA.​[[16]](#PauwelsRALxf6fdahlCGPostmaDSEtAl.Ef-8A270528)​[[17]](#BatemanEDBousheyHABousquetJEtAl.Can-8A2758D1) In adults, ICS/LABA combinations are recommended as controller therapy as well as reliever therapy if using the budesonide/formoterol combination.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)

Guidelines recommend the use of LABA/ICS combination products in asthma to improve ICS adherence and prevent the use of LABAs as monotherapy.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) Regular use of LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of death in patients with asthma.​[[2]](#CTS2021)​[[18]](#NelsonHSWeissSTBleeckerEREtAl.TheSa-8A286BC9)

Salmeterol has a slow onset of action and should not be used for immediate relief of bronchospasm. Formoterol has a rapid onset and, although it is effective for rescue therapy, it should be used only for rescue treatment when combined with budesonide or in addition to another ICS.

Vilanterol is a LABA available only with fluticasone **furoate** in a combination dry powder inhaler for once-daily administration. It is not commercially available as a single-entity product.

Indacaterol and olodaterol are LABAs approved for use in COPD. Indacaterol is now available in several combination products for asthma. Olodaterol is not currently indicated for asthma, as data on safety and efficacy are lacking.

### Combination Inhaled Corticosteroids and Long-Acting Bronchodilators

As LABAs should be given only to patients already on ICS, combination products of ICS and LABAs have been developed. Fluticasone propionate/​salmeterol and mometasone/​formoterol are given on a regular BID schedule; fluticasone furoate/​vilanterol and mometasone/​indacaterol are used as once-daily medications. Budesonide/​formoterol can be used for as-needed reliever therapy in mild asthma;​[[10]](#SYGMA-1)​[[11]](#SYGMA-2) in moderate to severe asthma, it can be used for both maintenance/controller therapy (regular BID schedule) and as-needed (reliever) therapy.​[[19]](#c0038n00236)

### Other Inhaled Agents

### Muscarinic Antagonists (or Anticholinergics)

Ipratropium is a **short-acting muscarinic antagonist** (SAMA; also known as SAAC, short-acting anticholinergic) that is used as an add-on therapy to beta2-agonists for management of acute asthma exacerbations. It is a useful alternative for patients who are unusually susceptible to tremor or tachycardia from beta2-agonists. Although the onset of action is delayed compared with beta2-agonists, the bronchodilator effect lasts longer. It may also be useful in beta-blocker–induced bronchospasm.​[[20]](#c0038n00211)

Tiotropium is a **long-acting** (once-daily) **muscarinic antagonist** (LAMA; also known as LAAC, long-acting anticholinergic) with an indication for improvement of lung function and a reduction of exacerbations. It has been shown to have value as an add-on therapy to improve lung function and decrease exacerbations in patients with symptomatic asthma despite maintenance treatment with high-dose ICS/LABA,​[[21]](#KerstjensHAEngelMDahlREtAl.Tiotropi-8A2BAC47) medium-dose ICS,​[[22]](#KerstjensHACasaleTBBleeckerEREtAl.T-8A2BEC96) low-dose ICS​[[23]](#PaggiaroPHalpinDMBuhlREtAl.TheEffec-8A2C9C7D) and medium-dose ICS ± LABA.​[[24]](#OhtaKIchinoseMTohdaYEtAl.Long-termO-8A2DA3B0)

Aclidinium, glycopyrronium and umeclidinium are LAMAs approved for use in COPD but are not indicated for asthma as monotherapy, as data on safety and efficacy are lacking.

### Triple-Therapy Combination Products

Two triple-therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) products, one containing mometasone/​glycopyrronium/​indacaterol, the other containing fluticasone/​umeclidinium/​vilanterol, are now available in Canada. They are indicated for adults with asthma that is not controlled with ICS/LABA combination therapy (see [Table 2](#c0038n00026)).

### Mast Cell Stabilizers

Although rarely used due to the availability of other agents, nebulized mast cell stabilizers (e.g., sodium cromoglycate) can be used in the treatment of asthma.

### Oral Agents

### Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs, e.g., montelukast) have anti-inflammatory properties; however, evidence suggests that they are not as effective as low-dose ICS for improving symptoms or preventing exacerbations.​[[25]](#c0038n00248) Consequently, they are second-line monotherapy after daily low-dose ICS or as-needed ICS/LABA for asthma control.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021)​[[25]](#c0038n00248) Although ICS/LABA are more effective than ICS with an LTRA for preventing exacerbations in adults,​[[26]](#c0038n00314) LTRAs may be considered as add-on therapy with a low-dose ICS, especially in those with concomitant rhinitis (see [Figure 1](#PharmMan-DCFD4A9F)).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021)​[[27]](#Price-10F3A0FB) Zafirlukast is no longer available in Canada. An FDA boxed warning has been added to montelukast for neuropsychiatric events. Serious mental health related side effects include suicidal thoughts or actions.​[[28]](#FDAMonte)

### Methylxanthines

Oral theophylline is uncommonly used due to systemic toxicity (including nausea, vomiting and cardiovascular issues such as tachycardia and arrhythmia) and only mild bronchodilator activity. Administer carefully according to standard regimens and monitor blood levels. In theophylline-naïve patients, titrate the dose slowly to minimize side effects. Aminophylline is no longer available in an oral formulation. Oxtriphylline is no longer available as a single-ingredient product in Canada.

### Oral Beta2-agonists

Oral orciprenaline and salbutamol offer less bronchodilation, more systemic side effects and a slower onset of action than the inhaled preparations and are not recommended.

### Systemic Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are useful in treating acute exacerbations. Optimal dosage has not been established, but the Canadian guidelines suggest 25–50 mg of prednisone daily for 7–14 days.​[[2]](#CTS2021) The risk of side effects may be reduced by limiting treatment to short periods (1–2 wk) following an acute exacerbation.

Less commonly, systemic low-dose corticosteroids can be used as long-term controller therapy. Potential side effects are significant: fluid retention, glucose intolerance, increased BP, increased appetite, mood alterations, and weight gain in the short term; and adrenal axis suppression, avascular necrosis of the hip, cataracts, dermal thinning, diabetes, glaucoma, hypertension, myopathy and osteoporosis in the long term. Some side effects with long-term use may be minimized by using alternate-day dosing regimens; however, reducing systemic steroid exposure should be a goal of therapy in all patients requiring corticosteroid therapy, even those getting bolus doses for exacerbations. Newer therapeutic agents have the potential to minimize the need for use of chronic systemic corticosteroids.

### Biologic Therapy

Biologics are used as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma whereby investigatory tests (see [Investigations](#c0038n00007)) demonstrate the appropriate biomarkers (e.g., serum IgE, allergy testing, blood eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and potentially, where available, sputum eosinophils). These agents may improve symptom control, FEV1, frequency of exacerbations and/or reduce oral corticosteroid exposure.​[[14]](#CTS-SevereAsthma.-05B4F3D6) These therapies should be initiated only by those with significant expertise in asthma management.

For dosing information, see [Table 2](#c0038n00026).

### IgE-Neutralizing Antibody

Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds IgE, may be considered for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have had a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with high-dose ICS and add-on therapy. In these patients, omalizumab significantly decreases the incidence of asthma exacerbations and improves overall asthma control.​[[29]](#c0038n00267)​[[30]](#c0038n00268) It is administered subcutaneously every 2–4 weeks (based on patient-related factors).

### Interleukin-5 Inhibitors

Mepolizumab is an interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibitor that is indicated for add-on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are poorly controlled on ICS plus an additional agent and who have a blood eosinophil count >150 cells/mcL. It is a subcutaneous injection given every 4 weeks. In a meta-analysis, mepolizumab was shown to reduce exacerbations requiring hospitalization as well as hospitalization/urgent care visits by almost 50%.​[[31]](#YanceySW-E2259C18)

Benralizumab is another IL-5 receptor blocker. It has an eosinophil blood count prescribing criteria of >300 cells/mcL and is administered subcutaneously every 8 weeks after a loading phase (3 doses administered every 4 weeks).​[[32]](#BleeckerERFitzGerald-E225A1F3)​[[33]](#FitzGeraldJM1BleeckerER2NairPEtAl.B-8A30BE32)

Reslizumab​[[34]](#CastroMZangrilliJWechslerMEEtAl.Res-8A305632) also belongs in the IL-5 inhibitor class and has an eosinophil blood count prescribing criteria of ≥400 cells/mcL. It should be administered via IV infusion every 4 weeks.

### Anti-Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin

Tezepelumab is an anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) human monoclonal antibody. TSLP is a cytokine involved in the asthma inflammatory cascade. This medication is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma. It is a subcutaneous injection given every 4 weeks.​[[35]](#tezepelumabRef)

### Anti—Interleukin 4 and 13

Dupilumab is an IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor that is approved as an adjunctive treatment of moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. In patients with uncontrolled asthma, dupilumab improves lung function and reduces the annual rate of severe asthma exacerbations.​[[36]](#ZayedDupilumab-05B920FC)

### Immunotherapy

In a 2010 Cochrane review, **subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)** was recommended for patients with asthma with identified allergies, as it reduces both asthma symptoms and the use of asthma medications and improves bronchial hyperreactivity. One trial included in the review found the benefit of SCIT is possibly comparable to ICS. The possibility of local or systemic adverse effects (such as anaphylaxis) must be considered in deciding the benefit in an individual.​[[37]](#AbramsonMJPuyRMWeinerJM.InjectionAl-8A3225FD)

The role of **sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)** in the treatment of asthma is less clear, with most available evidence being in patients with mild to moderate asthma. In a Cochrane review, serious adverse events (including anaphylaxis) were very rare in people receiving SLIT, albeit the evidence in very severe asthma is lacking.​[[38]](#NormansellRKewKMBridgmanAL.Sublingu-8A328031) SLIT therapy is available for ragweed, house dust mites, grass and tree allergies. GINA 2023 recommends that practitioners consider house dust mite SLIT in patients with concomitant allergic rhinitis and persistent asthma symptoms despite low or medium dose ICS therapy if FEV1 <70% predicted.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)

### Macrolide Antibiotics

The role of chronic macrolides in the prevention of asthma exacerbations is controversial and requires further research. Macrolide therapy should be initiated only by those with significant expertise in asthma management who can weigh the harms (e.g., hearing disturbances, antibiotic resistance, QT prolongation) against the potential benefits.

The 2017 AMAZES trial demonstrated that, in patients with uncontrolled asthma, thrice-weekly azithromycin reduced exacerbations and improved asthma-related quality of life.​[[39]](#AMAZES-0FE8E819) Conversely, chronic macrolide administration was not found to be beneficial in a 2015 Cochrane review, which also found that many studies had methodological issues,​[[40]](#KewKMUndelaKKotortsiIEtAl.Macrolide-8A97228C) nor in the AZALEA study, which excluded many patients due to previous antibiotic therapy.​[[41]](#JohnstonSLSzigetiMCrossMEtAl.Azithr-8A9790BC) Due to these conflicting results, generalizability is challenging; one theory suggests that this therapy is useful only in those with a non-eosinophilic phenotype, which is a less-common form of asthma.

### Prevention of Exacerbations

### Influenza Vaccine

Annual **influenza vaccination** is recommended for all individuals >6 months of age without contraindication to the vaccine, particularly those at high risk of complications related to influenza, such as those with asthma.​[[42]](#NACI_Flu-05A48527) A systematic review found that influenza vaccination reduced febrile illness as well as asthma exacerbations requiring urgent care and/or hospitalizations.​[[43]](#Vasileiou-05A587E4) For more information related to influenza vaccination, see Influenza.

*Note*: the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated in those who are pregnant or those with a history of *severe* asthma, defined as “current oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids, active wheezing or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to the proposed date of immunization.”​[[42]](#NACI_Flu-05A48527)

### Pneumococcal Vaccine

There are 4 types of pneumococcal vaccines available for adults in Canada—a **13-valent conjugate vaccine (PNEU-C-13)**, a **15-valent conjugate vaccine (PNEU-C-15)**, a **20-valent conjugate vaccine (PNEU-C-20)**, and a **23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PNEU-P-23)**. While evidence of effectiveness has been mixed, the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-16-pneumococcal-vaccine.html) recommends that a pneumococcal vaccine be administered to all individuals with a history of asthma exacerbation requiring medical care in the past 12 months with the following recommendations:​[[44]](#NACIPneumo-05B2554A)

- Adults: 1 dose of PNEU-P-23 vaccine. Some experts recommend that a booster dose be administered at 65 years of age and at least 5 years later; however, current evidence does not support this practice.

  *Note*: PNEU-C-13 may be considered in patients with asthma due to their increased risk of pneumococcal illness; however, it is not universally covered across Canada. As a rule, PNEU-C-13 should be given prior to PNEU-P-23 by at least 8 weeks; however, if PNEU-P-23 is given first, PNEU-C-13 should be delayed for 1 year (for more information, see Community-Acquired Pneumonia, Figure 1).
- Children 5–18 years of age: 1 dose of PNEU-C-13 followed by 1 dose of PNEU-P-23 eight weeks later.
- Children <5 years of age: see Asthma in Infants and Children.

The use of PNEU-C-15 and PNEU-C-20 has not yet been deliberated on by the National Advisory Committee of Immunization.

### COVID-19 Vaccine

It is recommended for individuals with asthma to be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations, including booster doses. To date, studies indicate that well controlled mild to moderate asthma does not increase risk of COVID-19–related death. However, the risk of COVID-19–related death is increased in hospitalized patients with severe asthma and in those who recently required oral corticosteroids to control their asthma.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) See COVID-19 for further details.

### RSV Vaccine

The RSV vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Adults with asthma are among those highest at risk for severe RSV.​[[45]](#GOLD)

### Other Vaccines

Patients with asthma are at higher risk of hospitalization and death from vaccine preventable diseases.​[[46]](#CDC) Based upon age and other risk factors, encourage this population to stay up to date on all recommended vaccinations.

### Other Considerations

### Inhaler Technique

All inhaler types are equally capable of delivering an appropriate medication dose.​[[47]](#DolovichMBAhrensRCHessDRDeviceSelec-8A9CBF0D)​[[48]](#BrocklebankDRamFWrightJEtAl.Compari-8A9CFE53) In daily use, however, a large majority of patients make inhalation errors.​[[49]](#SanchisJGichIPedersenSEtAl.Systemat-916299A2) Suboptimal inhaler technique is associated with worsened health outcomes, worsened asthma control and an increased risk of hospitalizations.​[[50]](#MelaniASBonaviaMCilentiVInhalerMish-8AA17922)

It is important that inhaler technique be reviewed and observed at every encounter to ensure optimization of pharmacotherapy.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)​[[2]](#CTS2021) For example, pMDIs require a slow, deep breath for medication delivery, while DPIs require a quick, deep breath. Patients should not be prescribed different types of inhalers (e.g., a pMDI and a DPI), as inhaler technique errors are likely to occur. Patient education resources, including videos demonstrating proper inhaler technique, can be obtained from [Family Physician Airways Group of Canada](https://www.fpagc.com/tools-resources).

### Adherence

Unfortunately, while first fills for ICS are quite good, this is not true for subsequent fills, with adherence rates at approximately 36%.​[[51]](#BlaisLKettaniFZForgetAEtAl.Assessin-8AA24C37) Integrated care programs and close follow-up can improve adherence rates.​[[52]](#Guxe9netteLBretonMCGrxe9goireJPEtAl-8AA28CE8) Poor adherence is one of the major reasons patients experience poor asthma control.​[[53]](#WuACButlerMGLiLEtAl.PrimaryAdherenc-8AA30FB3) Asthma outcomes are clearly better in those who are adherent to their medications.​[[54]](#IsmailaA1CorriveauDVaillancourtJEtA-8AA3A87D)

Asthma education is important to improve adherence and change patient behaviour. It can be done informally during asthma-related visits with the primary providers. However, an Asthma Educator certification is available in Canada; evidence shows improved outcomes in patients undergoing formal asthma education programs.​[[55]](#BouletLPBoulayMxc8GauthierGEtAl.Ben-8AB0A3AD) The [Canadian Network for Respiratory Care](http://www.cnrchome.net/) is a repository of Asthma Educators available in Canada.

### Step-Up and Step-Down Therapy

If a current level of medication is not providing sufficient asthma control, consider stepping up therapy after 6–12 weeks. This could include stepping up controller therapy from a low-dose ICS to ICS/LABA, adding a LABA, LTRA, LAMA or theophylline, or considering the initiation of a biologic therapy, all depending on the starting point. Step-up therapy is done after the diagnosis is confirmed, adherence is optimized, comorbidities such as rhinitis and GERD are accounted for, triggers are evaluated and removed, and inhaler technique has been optimized.

Similarly, once a patient with asthma has attained total control (no exacerbations, no night awakenings, near normal or normal lung function, relief of airway inflammation, if measurable, and daytime symptoms or beta2-agonist use of less than twice per week), and if the patient is not pregnant or about to travel away from available health care, step-down therapy can be considered. This should be done in 3-month intervals while closely monitoring the patient and can include reducing ICS dose by 25–50%, reducing another agent or removing a bronchodilator.​[[56]](#Gionfriddo-0FEC94FB) Complete cessation of ICS has been associated with worsening asthma control and exacerbations and should thus be avoided.

In patients with severe asthma taking omalizumab for 1.5 years and daily oral corticosteroids (OCS), 1 study evaluated an omalizumab step-down protocol whereby the dose was reduced by 50% every 6 months; tapering was postponed if spirometry worsened by ≥10% or if an OCS booster dose was required. Omalizumab was discontinued, reduced or maintained in 34%, 23% and 43% of patients, respectively.​[[57]](#Domingo--1005608B) In another study, continued treatment with a biologic was compared with switching or stopping biologic treatment. It was demonstrated that stopping biologic treatment, in patients with severe asthma, leads to worse clinical outcomes and higher emergency healthcare resource utilization.​[[58]](#CHEST)

The boxed warning regarding combination LABA/ICS use and asthma-related adverse events has been completely removed;​[[59]](#BusseWW-10F5BC49) as such, the use of these combination agents should not be feared.

There is a Health Canada boxed warning against LABA monotherapy in asthma.​[[60]](#HCLABACI-1006D9F4) Furthermore, LABA discontinuation or reduction, when taken in combination with an ICS, is often considered a desirable endpoint; however, a Cochrane review examined studies where the LABA was withdrawn from LABA/ICS combination therapy in patients with stable asthma, and found that withdrawal may lead to more exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids, worsened symptom control and decreased quality of life.​[[61]](#AhmadSKewKMNormansellR.StoppingLong-8AB1EE88)

Close follow-up is needed to prevent destabilizing these patients in the attempt to reach the lowest effective dosages.

### Asthma Action Plans

A written asthma action plan should be provided to patients to help them learn to recognize and respond appropriately to worsening asthma. It should include specific instructions for the patient about changes to reliever and controller medications, how and when to use OCS, and when to seek medical attention. The plan should be activated when asthma symptoms are interfering with normal activities or peak expiratory flow (PEF) has fallen by >20% for more than 2 days. Examples of adult asthma action plans can be found in the article by Kouri A et al ​[[62]](#KouriA-1BBD5FBE) as well through the [Family Physician Airways Group of Canada](https://www.fpagc.com/) .

Though evidence is limited,​[[63]](#c0038n00318) the Canadian Thoracic Society suggests that adults with a history of severe exacerbations in the past year who required systemic corticosteroids may initiate a trial of a 4- or 5-fold increase in ICS dose for 7–14 days as part of an action plan for managing acute loss of asthma control.​[[2]](#CTS2021) A Cochrane Review showed no benefit in this practice;​[[63]](#c0038n00318) however, a more recent study involving adults and adolescents showed a reduction in severe exacerbations with a 4-fold increase in ICS dose.​[[64]](#McKeever4-10093894) Conversely, a 2018 study in children showed no benefit in a 5-fold ICS dose increase as well as a slowing of linear growth, especially in children 5–7 years of age.​[[65]](#Jackson5-10093C6E)

For those willing to use an ICS/LABA as reliever therapy (only currently indicated for budesonide/​formoterol), the asthma action plan can be a bit simpler. The plan may include the use of the ICS/LABA as required (up to 8 puffs/day) or adjusting the controller dose aggressively, although adjusting the controller dose does not have as much evidence and is rarely done.

### Emergency Treatment of Asthma

See [Figure 3](#ManAsthmaEx-DCFD56F8) for the emergency management of acute asthma.

- Priorities include securing airway (if necessary), oxygenation, rehydration, bronchodilation and use of anti-inflammatory medications.

  - oxygenation: use pulse oximetry to maintain oxygen saturation at 93–95%; it is not necessary to increase to 100%
- Bronchodilation using a metered dose inhaler with a spacer is equivalent to nebulized therapy.​[[66]](#c0038n00032)​[[67]](#c0038n00215)
- Additive bronchodilator effect of ipratropium **bromide** (SAMA or SAAC) and the beta2-adrenergic agonists (SABA) supports administering these 2 medications concomitantly.​[[68]](#c0038n00217) This combination prevents hospitalizations for adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at higher risk of hospitalization. Patients receiving the combination are more likely to experience adverse events, which can include tremor, agitation and palpitations.​[[69]](#KirklandSWVandenbergheCVoaklanderBE-9165E3D8) A combination product (ipratropium/​salbutamol) is also available as a nebule for inhalation.
- Use oral or parenteral corticosteroids early in most patients.​[[70]](#c0038n00218)

  - systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation​[[71]](#RoweBHSpoonerCHDucharmeFMCorticoste-8AB73514)​[[72]](#EdmondsMLMilanSJCamargoCAJrEtAl.Ear-8AB77F6F)
  - OCS are as effective as injectable, are quicker to administer and are less expensive; the onset of action may be slightly slower, and oral formulations may be poorly tolerated as they may cause vomiting​[[73]](#RattoDAlfaroCSipseyJEtAl.AreIntrave-8AB9C2D0)​[[74]](#HarrisonBDStokesTCHartGJVaughanDAAl-8AB9EF29)​[[75]](#KirklandCrossCampbell-E22A2E47)
  - consider urgent administration in acute-care settings if:

    - initial treatment with SABA fails to achieve lasting symptomatic improvement
    - current exacerbation develops in a patient taking OCS and potentially in those who have used them within the last 3 months
    - the patient has required OCS for treatment of previous exacerbations
- The empiric use of antibiotics for an asthma exacerbation is discouraged by the guidelines.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) In a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with asthma, the length of stay in hospital was increased by a median of 1 day in those treated with antibiotics; however, patients treated with antibiotics were more likely to be older, with a history of smoking and more comorbidities.​[[76]](#Stefan18457351)
- Avoid IV aminophylline in first few hours of acute asthma.​[[77]](#c0038n00033)​[[78]](#c0038n00219)
- IV magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine administration; however, administration of magnesium sulfate 2 g infused over 20 minutes may reduce hospital admissions in:​[[79]](#KewIVMgSO4-10F6E94D)​[[80]](#FitzGeraldJM.MagnesiumSulfateIsEffe-8B1B7DAF)​[[81]](#Gallegos-Solxf3rzanoMCPxe9rez-Padil-8B1BCEE5)

  - adults with FEV1 <25–35% predicted upon presentation
  - adults not responding to initial treatment and continuing to have hypoxemia
- Nebulized magnesium sulfate can be used in combination with nebulized salbutamol in patients presenting with severe exacerbations (FEV1 <50% predicted).​[[82]](#PowellCDwanKMilanSJEtAl.InhaledMagn-8B1EDD15)

### Special Populations

### Asthma in Adolescents

Asthma control is often reduced in adolescents, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. In this patient population, poor adherence to treatment is a major contributor, estimated to be present in approximately 30–70% of patients; other factors include:​[[83]](#TeenAdherence)

- New responsibility of asthma management
- Forgetfulness or too busy to use inhaler
- Social stigma related to inhaler use
- Substance use, e.g., introduction of alcohol, cannabis, tobacco products
- Mental health comorbidities, which may emerge during adolescence
- Financial burden

Health-care providers can improve adherence in this patient population by regularly reviewing inhaler technique, ensuring appropriate inhaler selection (based on patient preference, ease of use, convenience, cost), switching from SABA to ICS/formoterol (daily or PRN) if appropriate, educating on the risks of smoking (tobacco or cannabis) and assessing for comorbid mental health conditions.​[[83]](#TeenAdherence) See also Asthma in Infants and Children.

### Comorbid Asthma and COPD

Patients with asthma may have concomitant COPD. According to international bodies, including both GOLD (for COPD) and GINA (for asthma), these individuals should be treated with sufficient ICS to control the airway inflammation and sufficient bronchodilator to manage symptoms. Therapy should be individualized for each patient based on the diagnostic process discussed in [Investigations](#c0038n00007), e.g., lung function, exacerbation history, symptoms, eosinophil levels. Combination therapy (ICS/LABA +/- LAMA) is often required to control symptoms. For more information, see Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

### Procedures

### Bronchial Thermoplasty

Bronchial thermoplasty is still considered an experimental therapy performed in only a few localized centres in Canada. It is an endoscopic procedure in which radiofrequency pulses are applied to the lining of the lung to destroy the constricting smooth muscle tissue in the airway. It can be considered in patients whose severe asthma is uncontrolled due to persistent bronchial hyperreactivity, especially if they do not qualify for, do not respond to or have unmanageable adverse effects to biologic therapies.​[[7]](#PavordIDCoxGThomsonNCEtAl.SafetyAnd-8A98268E)​[[8]](#DhedaK1KoegelenbergCFEsmailAEtAl.Re-8A988B51)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Asthma and Pregnancy

Pregnancy does not affect asthma in any predictable manner, with some patients noticing worsening of symptoms, some noticing no change and others noticing improvement of symptoms (roughly a third in each category, and usually the pattern persists in subsequent pregnancies).​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3) Much more important is the effect of poor asthma control on the outcome of the pregnancy. Inadequate control of asthma during pregnancy is associated with worse outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital anomalies, pre-eclampsia and placenta previa. Conversely, good control of asthma during pregnancy is associated with a normal outcome.

### Management of Asthma during Pregnancy

The best outcome for pregnancy complicated by asthma occurs with optimal management of asthma using the same stepwise approach as in nonpregnant patients.​[[6]](#c0038n00172) Short-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (particularly budesonide) have been used extensively and are considered safe for use in pregnancy.​[[84]](#c0038n00316) Theophylline is also considered safe in pregnancy; however, its clinical utility is lower because it is less efficacious. Theophylline may worsen gastroesophageal reflux, can cause nausea, and has a narrow therapeutic index, so avoid if possible.​[[84]](#c0038n00316) Accumulating evidence indicates montelukast may be used safely during pregnancy.​[[85]](#c0038n00254) Current experience with the use of LABAs during pregnancy has not shown adverse effects.​[[86]](#LimAStewartKKonigKEtAl.SystematicRe-8AB51A3C) It must be emphasized that the risk of poor outcomes due to uncontrolled asthma is vastly higher than the risk posed by asthma medications. Consequently, clinicians and patients should aim for the best control possible to optimize outcomes for both patient and child.​[[87]](#c0038n00031)

Although registries are being created, there is a dearth of published data addressing the effectiveness and safety of biologic therapies (e.g., benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, omalizumab, reslizumab) during pregnancy. The risks associated with biologic use during pregnancy must be weighed against the risk to the pregnant patient and the child of uncontrolled asthma.

### Asthma and Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding has no known effect on the severity of asthma. When asthma medication is required for a breastfeeding patient, bronchodilators (**SABAs**, **LABAs** and **muscarinic antagonists**) are considered safe.​[[88]](#c0038n00319) Further, both inhaled and oral corticosteroids are considered safe for breastfeeding patients. Although theophylline is also considered safe, maintain blood theophylline levels in the low end of the therapeutic range in the patient. Montelukast is transferred into breast milk;​[[84]](#c0038n00316) however, it should be noted that it is indicated for patients with asthma as young as 6 months of age.

There is a lack of published data addressing the effectiveness and safety of biologic therapies (e.g., benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, omalizumab, reslizumab) in breastfeeding. The established benefits of breastfeeding must be weighed against the risk associated with biologic use.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Avoid ASA and NSAIDs in patients with ASA-induced asthma and in high-risk patients (severe asthma symptoms, nasal polyps, urticaria or chronic rhinitis).​[[89]](#c0038n00168) Use caution in all patients.
- Exercise caution with beta-blockers (including ophthalmic beta-blockers) and avoid if possible.
- Treat conditions that may affect asthma control, e.g., obesity, anxiety, depression, rhinitis, sinusitis and GERD.
- During viral pandemics, patients with asthma should ensure that non-pharmacologic measures are followed (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing, hand hygiene; for more information see COVID-19) and that they maintain their asthma control by using their medications as prescribed. It is recommended for individuals with asthma to be up to date with their vaccinations (e.g., COVID-19, influenza, RSV), including booster doses.​[[1]](#GINA2016-8A1E44F3)
- Patient education about asthma symptoms and therapy is essential for optimal management:
  - review inhaler technique regularly
  - provide a written action plan for self-management based on peak expiratory flow rates and/or signs and symptoms for each patient; examples of asthma action plans can be found through:
    - the [Canadian Lung Association](https://www.lung.ca/sites/default/files/media/asthma_action_plan.pdf) at www.lung.ca

Patients with personal or family history of glaucoma (and need high-dose ICS ) should have IOP checked soon after starting therapy and periodically thereafter. Fixed-dose combination inhalers are more convenient, enhance adherence, ensure the patient receives their ICS with the LABA , and are less expensive than the individual agents combined. A disadvantage is a loss in dosing flexibility. Not for reliever therapy. |
