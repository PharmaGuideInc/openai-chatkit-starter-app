### Introduction

Chronic cough (cough lasting >8 weeks) adversely affects quality of life and has an estimated prevalence of up to 20% in adults.​[[1]](#c0116n00010) There is a very broad differential diagnosis given the ubiquitous distribution of cough receptors in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and other anatomic compartments. In nonsmokers with a negative chest radiograph who are not taking an ACE inhibitor, chronic cough can be attributed to upper airway cough syndrome (UACS; formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome), asthma, GERD or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) in the majority of cases (see [Table 1](#c0116n00021)).​[[1]](#c0116n00010)​[[2]](#c0116n00017)​[[3]](#c0116n00009)​[[4]](#c0116n00012)​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D) Nonetheless, cough is refractory to therapy in up to 40% of cases referred to specialty clinics.​[[10]](#c0116n00131)

Chronic cough results from an interplay between airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and cough reflex hypersensitivity. The term unexplained chronic cough (UCC) has been proposed to describe a cough that remains unexplained after investigation and after supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines. UCC accounts for 5–10% of chronic cough cases.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)

Other forms of cough that are not discussed in this chapter include:

- Acute cough: <3 weeks in duration, most often infectious, contributes to clearing secretions and does not generally require antitussive therapy.​[[1]](#c0116n00010)​[[2]](#c0116n00017)​[[4]](#c0116n00012)
- Subacute or postinfectious cough: a persistent cough that lasts >3 weeks after the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis) but usually <8 weeks.​[[11]](#c0116n00011) The cough is generally self-limited and resolves on its own.​[[11]](#c0116n00011)

  *Note:* Pertussis is a well-recognized exception where cough is often prolonged; further discussion related to this topic is outside the scope of this chapter.

### Goals of Therapy

- Choose appropriate and effective therapy based on cough etiology
- Resist nonspecific cough suppression therapy, which may delay diagnosis of a curative cause
- Prevent complications attributable to cough, e.g., rib fractures, syncope, loss of sleep, aggravation of stress incontinence, exercise intolerance, emesis, epistaxis, ocular injury/hemorrhage
- Ensure uncommon but more serious causes, such as lung cancer, are not missed

### Investigations

A standardized approach (i.e., an anatomic diagnostic protocol [ADP]) will lead to identifiable cause(s) of cough in most patients​[[12]](#c0116n00015)​[[13]](#c0116n00143) (see ). More detailed testing (e.g., CT scan, bronchoscopy) should be reserved for those with no overt cause detected on initial evaluation and cough refractory to empiric therapeutic trials for the most common etiologies with clinical suspicion for other less-common causes (see [Table 2](#RedFlags)).

- History and physical exam, with special attention to:

  - duration of cough (variation in cough over the day), history of smoking (tobacco, cannabis) and medication use (ACE inhibitor), signs and symptoms of asthma, upper airway symptoms, GERD
  - examination of nasal cavities, oropharynx and otic canals, respiratory and cardiac systems
  - occupational and environmental causes, e.g., nonspecific irritants or allergens
  - personal or family history of atopy/asthma
- Objective measurements useful in the ADP:

  - chest x-ray (CXR)
  - spirometry to evaluate for asthma (pre-/post-bronchodilator) and COPD
  - challenge testing (e.g., methacholine) to detect airway hyperresponsiveness; however, this can be false-positive for asthma in up to 20% of cases in the investigation of cough
  - investigations for specific indications:

    - GERD: ambulatory pH monitoring most sensitive but still has limited predictability for detecting acid-related cough.​[[16]](#c0116n00132) Nonacid reflux can be detected by impedance monitoring but not widely available and not well validated. Upper GI and endoscopy often normal; laryngoscopy can be suggestive.​[[17]](#c0116n00148) A positive response to a therapeutic trial of H2-receptor antagonist or PPI can be employed if cough secondary to GERD is suspected.
    - NAEB: consider in patients with normal spirometry, normal CXR, negative methacholine challenge and sputum eosinophilia, elevated exhaled nitric oxide (if available) or a response to inhaled corticosteroids (see [Table 1](#c0116n00021))
    - less common causes of cough, depending on clinical suspicion, e.g., carcinoma of respiratory tract, chronic lung infection, interstitial lung disease, occult left heart failure, irritable larynx syndrome, bronchiectasis, foreign body aspiration; include CT and bronchoscopy
    - although frequently benign, the presence of hemoptysis requires investigation; consider bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, chronic infection (e.g., tuberculosis), malignancy or causes of pulmonary hemorrhage. Investigations include sputum for acid-fast staining and culture, sputum cytology, CXR and CT scan of the chest. Refer to a respirologist for fibre optic bronchoscopy

**Table 1:** Chronic Cough: Common Causes, Clinical Features and Investigations

| Common Causes | Clinical Features | Investigations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upper airway cough syndrome | Postnasal drainage; cobblestoning and mucus in oropharynx Nasal discharge Throat clearing | CT scan of paranasal sinuses (sinus x-rays often unhelpful) Nasal endoscopy |
| Cough variant asthma | Other typical features of asthma (such as wheezing) are often absent | Spirometry pre-/post-bronchodilator Methacholine challenge (sensitivity 60–80% , specificity >90% ), induced sputum for eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide |
| Gastroesophageal reflux disease | Consider after exclusion of other etiologies Up to 50% of cases not associated with typical reflux symptoms​ [6] ​ [7] | Gold standard for diagnosis lacking; options include: Upper GI series (limited sensitivity) pH monitoring/impedance (good sensitivity, moderate to poor specificity) Endoscopy is an option if pH monitoring not available (less sensitive) Therapeutic trial of H 2 RA or a PPI × 2–3 months ; however, may require more than acid suppression |
| ACE inhibitor ​ [8] | Dry, nonproductive cough Onset hours to months postinitiation No predisposing factors Class effect of ACE inhibitors | Drug withdrawal; resolution or marked improvement of symptoms within 1–4 wk |
| Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) ​ [9] | Often prolonged in postinfectious setting | Normal spirometry and chest x-ray, negative challenge testing, induced sputum eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide (if available) Therapeutic trial of ICS |

| Hemoptysis Smoking history: Smoker with >15–20 pack-year history Smoker >45 years of age with new or change in cough, or cough with voice disturbance Smoker 55–80 years of age with >30 pack-year history plus current smoker or quit smoking <15 years ago Prominent sputum production or dyspnea, especially at rest or at night Other local symptoms, e.g., hoarseness, dysphagia, odynophagia, vomiting, hematemesis Systemic symptoms, e.g., fever, weight loss, peripheral edema with weight gain Recurrent respiratory tract infections, e.g., pneumonia Abnormalities on the respiratory exam and/or chest radiograph |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Advise on smoking cessation (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). A temporary worsening of cough may occur, which may persist for several months.
- Recommend patient avoids exposure to allergens and irritants.
- Advise on lifestyle modifications for GERD, e.g., weight loss, specific food/beverage avoidance, nocturnal elevation of head of bed.
- Recommend daily large volume (>150 mL) hypertonic saline nasal irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis; no benefit established for low-volume saline irrigation.​[[18]](#c0116n00117) Prepackaged hypertonic saline or pharmacy-prepared solutions are preferred; however, if self-preparing the solution, emphasize the importance of using distilled or boiled water.​[[19]](#c0116n00145)
- Multimodality speech pathology therapy can be beneficial in laryngeal dysfunction and UCC.​[[20]](#c0116n00146)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Therapy of chronic cough is directed at the cause, once identified (see [Figure 1](#c0116n00019), [Table 3](#c0116n00025)).

- Chronic upper airway cough syndrome secondary to rhinosinus diseases: choose treatment according to the specific cause of UACS-induced cough if known.​[[21]](#c0116n00070) If the cause is not apparent, the combination of a **first-generation antihistamine** and a **decongestant** is recommended empirically for cough related to postnasal drip; first-generation antihistamines are usually more effective than the newer antihistamines in this setting.

  - Nonallergic rhinitis: appropriate therapy may include intranasal corticosteroids or **intranasal** ipratropium.​[[22]](#c0116n00153)
  - Allergic rhinitis: appropriate therapy may include antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists, e.g., montelukast (for more information, see Allergic Rhinitis).
  - Chronic rhinosinusitis: appropriate therapy may include **antibiotics**, short-course oral prednisone, **intranasal corticosteroids** or oral **decongestants**​[[21]](#c0116n00070) (see Acute Rhinosinusitis); consider referral to ENT specialist.
- Asthma: for information related to the treatment of asthma, see Asthma in Adults and Adolescents.
- NAEB: responds to inhaled corticosteroids.​[[9]](#c0116n00069)

  *Note:* elevated exhaled nitric oxide has been shown to predict likelihood of response of cough to inhaled corticosteroids independent of other symptoms.​[[23]](#c0116n00134)
- GERD: if nonpharmacologic (dietary and lifestyle) approaches fail to control symptoms in patients with GERD-associated chronic cough, guidelines suggest a trial of an **H2-receptor antagonist** (H2RA) or **PPI** for a minimum of 2–3 months (see Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease).​[[1]](#c0116n00010) A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence of benefit in patients with nonspecific chronic cough;​[[24]](#c0116n00085) however, a more recent systematic review identified a benefit with PPI therapy in a subset of patients with pathologic acid exposure confirmed through pH monitoring, although statistical analysis was not possible.​[[25]](#c0116n00135) Additional therapies for reflux may be required, e.g., prokinetic medications. In instances where GERD investigations are not feasible, a trial of acid suppression for 2–3 months is reasonable in patients with chronic cough in whom GERD is suspected as a contributing cause; however, guidelines suggest that if investigations for GERD are negative, empiric acid suppression therapy is not recommended.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)
- ACE inhibitor–induced cough: consider cough due to ACE inhibitor, regardless of the temporal onset. Stop ACE inhibitor as a trial.​[[26]](#c0116n00072) The median time to resolution of ACE inhibitor–induced cough is usually within 1 week but it may take up to 4 weeks. Cough usually recurs with rechallenge. An ARB may be an appropriate substitution and is generally not associated with cough.

**Antitussives** have a limited role in the management of chronic cough; however, they may sometimes be used to enable sleep or in certain social settings (e.g., live theatre) if the cough cannot be controlled by measures targeted at a specific diagnosis. Use with caution when cough is productive.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) is common and is observed in up to 40% of cases referred to specialty clinics.​[[27]](#c0116n00136) Use of the term cough hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed to account for persistent cough induced by triggers that in most individuals would produce at most a more short-lived manifestation.​[[28]](#c0116n00147) Hypersensitivity of afferent receptors may combine with central mechanisms to augment and perpetuate the cough. This has led to new approaches to therapy; for cough that is refractory to therapy, consider targeting cough hypersensitivity. Laryngeal dysfunction can respond to behavioural or multimodality speech pathology therapy.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)​[[20]](#c0116n00146) Cough receptor antagonists (e.g., P2X3 ion channel receptor antagonists) are under active study in refractory cough related to cough hypersensitivity. In adult patients with UCC and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (e.g., sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), guidelines state that inhaled corticosteroids should not be prescribed.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)

Gabapentin (up to 900 mg twice daily) has been shown to improve cough-specific quality of life and is recommended as an option for patients with UCC.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)​[[29]](#c0116n00137) Gabapentin should be re-evaluated at 6 months and patients should be closely monitored for side effects. Pregabalin may be efficacious but appears to have more adverse effects and a greater abuse potential; this is hypothesized to be related to its rapid onset of action.​[[30]](#RyanNM-4CC421D0) There is some evidence to support other neuromodulatory therapies. Morphine has been shown to reduce cough scores, but can require dose escalation and has abuse potential, particularly in longer-term use. Amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) may attenuate cough,​[[31]](#Jeyakumar-210513F3) but lacks sufficient evidence to be included in guideline recommendations.​[[5]](#GibsonPWangGMcGarveyLEtAl.Treatment-24AEE81D)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Information is limited regarding the prevalence, etiology and therapeutic options for chronic cough in pregnancy. Many of the common causes of cough can be exacerbated by pregnancy. This is most obvious for GERD because of smooth muscle relaxation and increased abdominal pressure. Lifestyle modifications and **antacids** are the first-line approach. There is considerable experience with **H2RAs** in pregnancy and these are generally considered safe.​[[32]](#c0116n00100) There is less information for **PPIs** but similarly the data are reassuring.​[[33]](#c0116n00101) For more information, see Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

Asthma and rhinitis may also be aggravated during pregnancy. The therapeutic approach to both UACS and asthma is minimally affected by pregnancy. **Short-acting bronchodilators** (e.g., **short-acting** beta2-adrenergic agonists) are widely employed and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended based on guidelines, although there is more evidence for some (budesonide) than others.​[[34]](#c0116n00102) Oral **first-generation** antihistamines and oral decongestants may be used in pregnancy; however, avoid decongestants in the first trimester. For a more complete discussion, see Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma in Adults and Adolescents.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- More than 1 cause of cough has been reported in up to 25% of cases. Therapy that has produced an improvement but not resolution of a cough should continue while investigations/therapies for other causes are pursued.
- Mucolytics have no proven role in the treatment of chronic cough.​[[1]](#c0116n00010)
- Consider inhaled ipratropium for cough due to upper respiratory infection or chronic bronchitis​[[1]](#c0116n00010) (see COPD).
- Nonsedating antihistamines (e.g., loratadine) may be effective for chronic cough due to allergic rhinitis.​[[21]](#c0116n00070)
- Cough has been reported in association with obstructive sleep apnea, and preliminary evidence has shown a response to therapy for this condition (continuous positive airway pressure).​[[35]](#c0116n00138)​[[36]](#c0116n00139)
- Psychogenic (habit) cough is uncommon and a diagnosis of exclusion. It may respond to suggestion or behavioural therapy.​[[37]](#c0116n00140)
- When employing a cough diagnostic/therapeutic algorithm (in prescreened patients), nonphysician respiratory educators have achieved comparable outcomes to subspecialists, with reduced referral wait times.​[[38]](#c0116n00149)
- The duration of therapy must be individualized. If there is a chronic disorder identified as the cause of the chronic cough, indefinite treatment may be necessary unless environmental or lifestyle modification is possible and effective.
- For UCC responding to treatment, a decision to taper therapy to the lowest effective dose or possible cessation after approximately 6 months is reasonable.
