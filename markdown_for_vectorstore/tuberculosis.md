### Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex. In the active form of the disease, the lungs are most commonly affected; however, any organ can be involved and there is potential for person-to-person transmission. For most individuals who acquire Mtb, the infection remains inactive or dormant because the pathogen is contained by host defenses. Dormant TB is not symptomatic or infectious, but could progress to active disease at any time.

TB terminology has changed over time. In the past, the term “latent TB” was used to indicate dormant Mtb infection without clinically active disease. The preferred terminology is now “**TB infection**,” and “active TB” is simply referred to as “**TB disease**.”

Although major advances have been made in TB treatment over the years, TB remains a global epidemic and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Each year, there are approximately 10 million cases of TB disease and 1.5 million deaths worldwide.​[[1]](#WHOGlobalTBReport2020) This chapter addresses the diagnosis and management of patients with TB disease and TB infection. For a general overview of the diagnosis and management of pulmonary TB disease, see [Figure 1](#c0094n00013).

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent person-to-person transmission through early diagnosis of TB disease, appropriate infection control and initiation of effective treatment
- Treat TB disease by eradicating Mtb from the affected organ(s)
- Achieve cure without relapse, prevent development of drug resistance, and prevent morbidity and mortality
- Prevent TB infection from progressing to clinically active disease through tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT), thereby breaking the cycle of transmission

### Investigations for TB Disease​[[3]](#CTBSChapter4-71731C3A)​[[12]](#Lewinsohn-6EBF5206)

- Microbiologic testing is essential to the diagnosis of TB disease; confirmation of disease entails one or both of the following:

  - growth of Mtb on mycobacterial culture
  - detection of Mtb on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)

    - NAATs can be directly performed on sputum, fluid or tissue specimens as an adjunct to mycobacterial smear/culture and histopathology to further improve diagnostic yield
    - NAATs help to confirm and expedite the diagnosis of TB disease but do not replace the need for mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST)​[[13]](#CTBSChapter10-718173B7)​[[14]](#CTBSChapter14)
    - when NAAT is performed on sputum, sensitivity exceeds 95% in smear-positive samples but is reduced to 50–70% in smear-negative samples; sensitivity is even lower in extrapulmonary specimens; thus, ***negative NAAT results alone should not be used to exclude TB***
- Investigations for pulmonary TB:​[[2]](#CTBSChapter3-717488CA)

  - chest radiographs (compare to previous if available); consider CT of the chest, especially if hemoptysis is present
  - the radiographic appearance of TB is variable in patients with certain medical conditions (e.g., HIV) and may even be normal
  - obtain at least 3 sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear *and* mycobacterial culture

    - sputum samples can be either spontaneous or induced; collect at least 1 hour apart
    - negative sputum smears do not exclude a diagnosis of active pulmonary TB; approximately 50% of patients with TB disease have negative sputum smears
    - sputum induction (in an appropriately ventilated room) has a similar yield to bronchoscopy, with less patient discomfort and fewer complications. Sputum induction requires a high-volume ultrasonic nebulizer for best results; those performed with a jet nebulizer likely have reduced sensitivity​[[15]](#AndersonCInhaberNMenziesD.AmJRespir-6DE292C8)
  - fiberoptic bronchoscopy ± transbronchial biopsy

    - useful when spontaneous and induced sputum are not available, alternative diagnoses are suspected or if miliary TB is a concern
    - for diagnosis of TB, bronchoscopy does not provide superior yield compared to induced sputum and the procedure is associated with higher risks as well as patient discomfort
    - endobronchial ultrasound and needle aspiration could be considered when there is mediastinal/pulmonary lymph node involvement
    - biopsy samples, if taken, may show caseating granulomas or AFB, which are additional clues to diagnosis
    - if bronchoscopy is performed, post-bronchoscopy sputum should also be collected for AFB smear and culture
  - gastric aspirates (fasting morning sample) may be collected in those who cannot produce sputum, such as young children or adults with dementia​[[16]](#CTBSChapter9)
- Investigations for extrapulmonary TB:​[[17]](#CTBSChapter7)

  - every effort should be made to obtain microbiologic confirmation of suspected extrapulmonary TB

    - the appropriate clinical specimens that should be collected depend on the site(s) of involvement and may include tissue and/or fluid samples
    - in general, tissue samples provide better diagnostic yield on culture compared to fluid aspiration; tissue biopsies should also be sent for histopathology to look for compatible findings
    - mycobacterial culture should be prioritized over other forms of testing if limited samples are available, as culture provides the highest diagnostic yield and allows for DST
  - ***always assess for concomitant pulmonary involvement (present in up to 50% of extrapulmonary cases) to determine infectiousness and isolation requirements***

    - sputum samples also provide another avenue for microbiologic confirmation, which may spare patients from invasive sampling of less accessible extrapulmonary sites
  - if pleural TB is suspected: perform thoracentesis to obtain pleural fluid for AFB smear (usually negative) and culture (sensitivity 10–63%), NAAT, chemical and cytologic analysis; diagnosis often requires pleural biopsy for culture and histology; a combination of thoracentesis and pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield significantly
  - if TB meningitis is suspected: perform lumbar puncture and send cerebrospinal fluid for AFB smear (usually negative), mycobacterial culture and TB NAAT, plus glucose, protein, white cell count and differential; neuroimaging may show characteristic findings that help support the diagnosis and inform prognosis
  - for investigations specific to other sites of extrapulmonary involvement, refer to [Chapter 7](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis/health-professionals/canadian-tuberculosis-standards/extra-pulmonary-tuberculosis.html) of the Canadian Tuberculosis Standards, 8th edition
- Adjunctive tests:

  - adenosine deaminase levels can be measured in pleural, peritoneal, pericardial and cerebrospinal fluid with reasonable sensitivity and specificity in high-burden settings; however, this test is not currently recommended in Canada and does not replace microbiologic confirmation of disease (it is also not routinely available)
- Baseline investigations prior to treatment:​[[13]](#CTBSChapter10-718173B7)​[[18]](#c0094n00034)​[[19]](#c0094n00461)​[[20]](#Noubiap-6EBF990E)

  - CBC and differential, ALT or AST, bilirubin, and creatinine
  - glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C)
  - hepatitis B and C virus serology
  - HIV testing should be performed in all patients with newly diagnosed TB disease unless they decline testing (an “opt-out” approach); patients with HIV tend to present atypically (see [Tuberculosis in Special Populations](#c0094n00318))
  - visual acuity and colour vision testing (if ethambutol is planned)
  - weight

### Investigations for TB Infection​[[3]](#CTBSChapter4-71731C3A)​[[12]](#Lewinsohn-6EBF5206)

- TB infection (previously referred to as latent TB) is a clinical diagnosis that is most often made upon review of a patient’s TB exposure risk assessment, risk of progressing to active disease and chest radiograph to support the interpretation of the 2 most commonly used diagnostic tests (i.e., TST and IGRA)
- Considerations in the use of TST and IGRA:

  - these tests assess for previous exposure to Mtb, but neither test can distinguish TB infection from active disease; ***negative results are not sufficient to exclude TB disease***
  - neither test should be used for the diagnosis of TB disease in adults; in children, TST and/or IGRA can be used as adjuncts to help support a diagnosis of TB disease, but up to 30% of children with TB disease have false-negative results on TST/IGRA​[[16]](#CTBSChapter9)
  - TST and IGRA can be performed sequentially in certain cases to enhance sensitivity (i.e., if the initial test is negative) or specificity (i.e., if the risk of infection is low but the initial test is positive)
- TST (also known as the Mantoux test):​[[3]](#CTBSChapter4-71731C3A)​[[12]](#Lewinsohn-6EBF5206)

  - intradermal injection of Mtb protein derivative (tuberculin) to look for delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
  - 48–72 hours after intradermal inoculation, the widest transverse diameter of induration (not erythema) is measured
  - should not be performed on persons with previous positive TST results (particularly if they had severe/blistering skin reactions), documented active disease or prior history of treated TB, extensive burns or eczema, current major viral infection, or recent vaccination with a live virus vaccine (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella) in the past 4 weeks
  - false-positive and false-negative results may occur in certain situations (see [Table 2](#TST_FP_FN))​[[21]](#CTBS7thedChapter4)
  - patients’ recall of previous test results is not reliable and results may vary between arms and between observers

---

**Table 2:** Potential Causes of False-Positive and False-Negative TST Results​[[21]](#CTBS7thedChapter4)

| False-Positive Result | False-Negative Result |
| --- | --- |
| Prior BCG vaccination​ [a] Exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria Inappropriate technique/reading, e.g., recording size of erythema rather than induration | Impaired cell-mediated immunity TB disease or other infection(s) Serious illness Extremes of age Inappropriate technique/reading, e.g., drawing tuberculin material up into the syringe more than 20 min before administration Storage and stability issues, e.g., significant exposure of tuberculin to sunlight, cold-chain excursions, expired vials |

[a] BCG vaccination status should not preclude use of TST to diagnose TB infection in the event of contact. For a more detailed review of the nuances of interpreting TST in the context of BCG vaccination, refer to the Canadian Tuberculosis Standards, [Chapter 4](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/infectious-diseases/canadian-tuberculosis-standards-7th-edition/edition-16.html) (see [Suggested Readings](#c0094n00379)).

**Abbreviations**

BCG
:   bacillus Calmette-Guérin

TB
:   tuberculosis

TST
:   tuberculin skin test

---

- IGRA:​[[3]](#CTBSChapter4-71731C3A)​[[12]](#Lewinsohn-6EBF5206)

  - *in vitro* assays that evaluate T cell response to Mtb antigens
  - commercially available IGRAs include the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay and the T-SPOT.TB assay
  - IGRAs have similar sensitivity in the detection of TB infection compared to TST
  - IGRAs are more specific than TST in populations with prior BCG vaccination

    - the [BCG World Atlas](http://www.bcgatlas.org) may be used as a reference for current and past BCG vaccination practices in different countries
  - IGRA is preferred over TST in situations where:

    - the patient is 2–9 years of age with prior BCG vaccination
    - the patient received multiple BCG vaccinations, was vaccinated after age 1 or the time of vaccination is unknown
    - the patient is not likely to return for TST reading after injection
    - TST is not available or is contraindicated
  - IGRAs are not acceptable when serial testing is expected/indicated to assess for new infections (e.g., screening in health-care workers, contact investigations)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Public Health Considerations

Notify the local Department of Health or applicable organization for contact tracing. Decisions around contact tracing may vary based on the site(s) of involvement, symptoms, level of infectivity, length of illness and drug resistance.

### Infection Prevention and Control

All patients with known or suspected pulmonary TB should be either hospitalized in a single-occupancy negative-pressure room with airborne precautions or isolated at home if they can avoid high risk (e.g., young children, immunocompromised) or unexposed contacts.

The [Canadian TB Standards, 8th edition](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis/health-professionals/canadian-tuberculosis-standards.html) provide updated conditional recommendations regarding the criteria for de-isolation based on available, albeit poor, evidence.​[[22]](#CTBSAppendixB) A summary of these recommendations is available in [Table 3](#IsolationDe-escalation). Notably, sputum smear conversion is no longer an absolute requirement for de-isolation, as evidence suggests that sputum smear status becomes less predictive of infectiousness once patients are established on appropriate therapy. Therefore, in some cases where the patient remains smear-positive even after months of effective treatment, waiting for smear conversion before lifting airborne precautions may cause unnecessary patient harm through protracted isolation without much benefit from the public health perspective.​[[22]](#CTBSAppendixB) Readers are encouraged to review the [entire document](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis/health-professionals/canadian-tuberculosis-standards.html) to ensure a clear understanding of additional caveats.

**Table 3:** Recommended De-isolation Requirements for Pulmonary TB​[[22]](#CTBSAppendixB)

| Clinical Scenario | Criteria for De-isolation |
| --- | --- |
| Smear-negative, rifampin-susceptible | Clinical evidence of improvement Completed minimum of 2 wk of effective therapy |
| Smear-positive, rifampin-susceptible | Clinical evidence of improvement Completed minimum of 2 wk of effective therapy 3 consecutive negative AFB sputum smears​ [a] |
| Rifampin or multidrug resistant | Consult local TB and public health experts |

[a] If sputum smears are persistently positive, airborne precautions could still be discontinued as long as a minimum of 4 weeks of effective therapy have been completed along with clinical evidence of improvement.

**Abbreviations:**

AFB
:   acid-fast bacilli

TB
:   tuberculosis

Proper N95 masks (which filter particles 1 micron in size, have a 95% filter efficiency when tested in the unloaded state and provide a tight facial seal) should be worn by health-care providers when caring for patients with known or suspected infectious TB disease. Surgical masks do not prevent the inhalation of droplet nuclei by others but should be worn by patients to reduce the expulsion of infectious droplets.

All patients with symptoms and/or chest imaging consistent with TB disease should be isolated pending the results of sputum smears for AFB.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Promote culturally sensitive and person-centred care. For example, understand the social and historical forces that put a person at risk for TB and how these factors may impact their health-care engagement. Understand the potential for bias and discrimination from health-care workers and the health-care system. Utilize professional interpreters in the patient’s language of choice instead of family and friends.​[[2]](#CTBSChapter3-717488CA) Promote appropriate language to help empower people affected by TB.​[[23]](#stopTB)
- Educate the patient regarding the nature of disease and importance of treatment adherence.
- Optimize adherence through the use of incentives and enablers (e.g., financial and social assistance, reminders, blister packs).
- Adequate nutrition may enhance healing and decrease the risk of relapse.​[[24]](#c0094n00041)
- Caution against the ingestion of alcohol and other potential hepatotoxins, as they may aggravate drug-induced hepatitis.
- Encourage smoking cessation.​[[25]](#c0094n00424)
- Encourage diabetes management, as glycemic control may impact the risk of treatment failure, relapse and mortality.​[[19]](#c0094n00461)
- Refer for management of comorbid conditions such as HIV, hepatitis C, substance use disorder.
- Mandatory close follow-up during treatment, e.g., monthly clinic visits with blood work and regular chest radiographs with a final radiograph at treatment completion. Follow sputum smears and cultures for AFB monthly to monitor treatment response and determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
- Follow-up post-treatment to monitor for recurrence, which mostly occurs in the first 12–24 months post-TB treatment.
- Ensure that there is continuity of care following the completion of TB treatment, as people with TB disease experience high morbidity and mortality even after successful treatment. Many have pre-existing comorbidities and some may develop TB-related sequelae such as post-TB lung disease.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Directly Observed Therapy

Patient adherence is a major concern in TB therapy due to the intensive and prolonged nature of treatment, as well as the public health risks posed by the development of drug-resistant TB. To remove barriers to adherence, TB treatment programs should provide patients with access to daily support, individualized to meet their specific needs.

One form of adherence support is directly observed therapy (DOT), which requires health-care professionals or other trained personnel to routinely witness patients swallowing their TB medications.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[27]](#WHO_TB2017) The decision to implement DOT should be made in conjunction with the patient, with consideration for patient autonomy.

DOT is especially important for regimens involving intermittent therapy as well as for patients who are considered high risk for non-adherence, treatment failure or disease transmission (e.g., drug resistance, HIV infection, social or mental health issues). DOT can be implemented in a variety of settings, including at home, in the community or in a health facility. With recent technological advances, observation through video (VDOT) has emerged as a more cost-effective and convenient option for adherence support.

Successful treatment of TB disease is the joint responsibility of the patient, clinicians, local department of health and government. The delivery of adherence support should be tailored to each patient as part of a comprehensive, patient-centred treatment approach that respects cultural diversity.

### Tuberculosis Infection

People with TB infection potentially have low numbers of tubercle bacilli in their body; however, unlike people with TB disease, they are asymptomatic and non-infectious. The goal of TB preventive therapy (TPT) is to reduce the risk of progression to active disease. ***Prior to initiating TPT, It is essential to first rule out TB disease through clinical and radiographic assessment.***

In general, people with TB infection have about a 5–10% risk of developing TB disease over their lifetime.​[[28]](#WHO_Module1) However, the risk of progression to active disease is particularly high in certain patient groups. [Table 4](#TSTInterpretation) presents the interpretation of TST in the diagnosis of TB infection.

**Table 4:** Interpretation of TST Results in the Diagnosis of TB Infection​[[3]](#CTBSChapter4-71731C3A)

| TST Induration | Interpretation​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| <5 mm | In general, considered negative |
| ≥5 mm | Positive in the following populations/scenarios: Recent contact (<2 y) with a person with infectious TB disease Individuals living with HIV Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (with or without dialysis) Prior to receipt of organ transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy Prior to receipt of biologic drugs (e.g., tumour necrosis factor inhibitors) or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs Prior to receipt of corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≥15 mg/day for at least 1 month ) Individuals with fibronodular disease on chest radiograph |
| ≥10 mm | Positive |

[a] The interpretation of TST should also consider the pre-test probability and the clinical context. Websites such as [The Online TST/IGRA Interpreter](https://www.tstin3d.com) and [PERISKOPE-TB](http://periskope.org) are useful online tools that can assist with the interpretation.

**Abbreviations:**

HIV
:   human immunodeficiency virus

TB
:   tuberculosis

TST
:   tuberculin skin test

The decision to offer TPT should be individualized, and the potential benefit of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hepatotoxicity and other side effects of therapy. Online tools, such as [The Online TST/IGRA Interpreter](https://www.tstin3d.com) and [PERISKOPE-TB](http://periskope.org), are available to assist with the interpretation of TST/IGRA results and to help estimate the individual risk-benefit profile of TPT based on a given patient’s characteristics and test results. The risk of hepatotoxicity is higher in those with pre-existing liver disease and increases with age.​[[29]](#Kunst-945466C6) For patients with risk factors for reactivation (e.g., transplant, chronic kidney disease), age should not preclude treatment, although greater consideration must be made regarding adverse events. Baseline and monthly testing of CBC and liver enzymes are suggested during treatment. For more information, see [Antituberculous Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity](#c0094n00317).

The recommended first-line TPT options in Canada are 4 months of rifampin or weekly isoniazid (**INH**) and rifapentine for 12 weeks (see [Table 5](#table-LatentRegimens1843351-70E257CB)).​[[4]](#CTBSChapter6-717323B2)​[[30]](#Menzies-4mRIF)​[[33]](#CampbellJR-70483AA1)​[[34]](#Sterling-94551B3E) Isoniazid daily for 9 months (9INH) remains an option for patients in whom a rifamycin-containing regimen is contraindicated or not tolerated.​[[4]](#CTBSChapter6-717323B2) Rifapentine availability remains limited in Canada and is currently accessed through Health Canada’s [Urgent Public Health Need program](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/access-drugs-exceptional-circumstances/list-drugs-urgent-public-health-need.html).

Consultation with a TB specialist is recommended in the event of contact with a drug-resistant source case or if alternative regimens are considered.

### Tuberculosis Disease

Appropriate treatment of pulmonary TB requires the use of multiple drugs for an extended duration, along with providing patient-centred support to promote and facilitate adherence (see [Figure 1](#c0094n00013)). Knowledge of the epidemiology of local resistance is essential to ensure appropriate initial treatment. Empiric therapy should be reviewed and adjusted if necessary when susceptibility results become available (usually 2–4 wk into treatment). Single drug therapy should never be used for TB disease, nor should a single drug be added to a failing regimen.

Treatment begins with an initial (bactericidal or intensive) phase over the first 2 months to rapidly eliminate most organisms and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. This is followed by a continuation (sterilizing) phase to eradicate any remaining or dormant organisms and prevent relapse by achieving a long-lasting cure. Intermittent therapy in the intensive phase is associated with worse outcomes and should not be used. Intermittent, thrice-weekly treatment for the continuation phase may be offered in select circumstances. Twice-weekly regimens are no longer recommended in Canada.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65)

The standard empiric regimen for TB disease consists of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Once the isolate is confirmed to be fully susceptible, ethambutol may be discontinued, provided that the patient is tolerating, adhering to and responding to treatment. For fully susceptible disease, rifampin-based short-course treatment (see [Table 6](#c0094n00462)) is the standard of care with a minimum duration of 6 months.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[27]](#WHO_TB2017)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65) For fully susceptible disease, the minimum duration of treatment is 6 months for rifampin-based regimens that include isoniazid and pyrazinamide in the intensive phase of therapy. Longer treatment (minimum 9 months) is recommended for patients with extensive or cavitary pulmonary TB with persistently positive sputum smear or culture at 2 months because of an elevated risk of relapse and treatment failure.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65)​[[36]](#RomanowskiK-703F451B) The duration of treatment should also be extended to at least 9 months if pyrazinamide is omitted from the regimen.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65)

Patients should be reassessed at least monthly throughout the course of their therapy. Response to treatment is evaluated through a combination of clinical, radiologic and microbiologic parameters. Follow-up chest imaging should be performed at 2 months and at the end of therapy. Sputum cultures should be collected every 2 weeks until smear conversion is documented (if initially smear positive), then again at 2 months and 1 month prior to the anticipated end of therapy. If the culture remains positive at 2 months, then monthly sputum samples need to be obtained until culture conversion is achieved. Repeat DST is recommended if cultures remain persistently positive after 3 months of treatment.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65)

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is not routinely indicated but may be helpful in certain situations. For instance, TDM can guide dosing in patients with liver or kidney dysfunction, drug-resistant disease, or risk of malabsorption (e.g., low body mass index, HIV co-infection).​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65) Currently, routine TDM is not available in Canada, so samples need to be sent to the United States for analysis.

Treatment interruptions are not uncommon and typically occur due to drug intolerance/toxicity. It is generally accepted practice to completely restart from the beginning (i.e., the 4-drug intensive phase) if the cumulative duration of interruption is ≥14 days during the initial intensive phase of treatment, or ≥2 months during the continuation phase of treatment and <80% of the planned doses have been taken.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65) Consultation with a TB specialist is suggested when confronted with treatment interruptions, treatment failure or relapse, drug intolerance or adverse effects, or drug resistance.

### Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

Drug-resistant TB is a growing problem and poses considerable challenges to the global effort to eliminate TB. The major risk factors for drug-resistant TB include prior treatment for TB, exposure to a drug-resistant case and prior residence in a region with high rates of drug resistance.​[[11]](#CTBSChapter8-7173F997)​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[39]](#WHO_resistantTB) DST via growth-based and/or molecular assays are used to determine the extent of drug resistance.

Monoresistance to isoniazid is the most common pattern of resistance in Canada. In contrast, isolated resistance to rifampin is less common and, if detected, should prompt immediate susceptibility testing of other first- and second-line drugs.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[39]](#WHO_resistantTB) Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) refers to strains that are resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) refers to strains of MDR or rifampin-resistant TB (RR-TB) with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and at least one other Group A drug, as defined by the WHO.​[[40]](#WHO_defs) Drugs belonging to Group A are considered to be the most potent second-line agents and currently include levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, bedaquiline and linezolid.​[[11]](#CTBSChapter8-7173F997)​[[40]](#WHO_defs) Pre-XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB or RR-TB with resistance to any fluoroquinolone but no resistance to other Group A drugs. Further discussion of the treatment for drug-resistant TB is beyond the scope of this chapter.

MDR-TB and XDR-TB are associated with high morbidity and mortality.​[[11]](#CTBSChapter8-7173F997)​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5) ***Further discussion of the treatment for drug-resistant TB is beyond the scope of this chapter. Refer all patients with MDR-TB to a TB specialist with expertise in MDR-TB therapy***.

### Antituberculous Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity is the most frequent serious adverse event associated with first-line drugs and can occur in relation to pyrazinamide, isoniazid and/or rifampin. Drug-induced liver injury is defined as aminotransferase (AST or ALT) level ≥3 times the upper limit of normal in symptomatic patients (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice) or ≥5 times the upper limit of normal in asymptomatic patients.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5) In severe cases, fulminant liver failure could develop.

Asymptomatic transaminitis is common in TB therapy, and a decision to stop or withhold treatment must include a plan to rechallenge. If significant or symptomatic hepatotoxicity is detected, withhold all hepatotoxic drugs and consult a local TB specialist to re-establish therapy as quickly as possible. Of the 4 first-line drugs, pyrazinamide is considered to be the most hepatotoxic and, therefore, it may be omitted from the regimen in older patients and others who are at risk for hepatotoxicity (with longer treatment duration as the trade-off).​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65)

### Tuberculosis in Special Populations

### Pediatric Tuberculosis

When TB is diagnosed in a young child, reverse-contact tracing should be undertaken without delay to identify the infectious source case, typically an adolescent or adult household contact. With rare exceptions (e.g., cavitary or laryngeal tuberculosis), children <5 years of age with TB are not considered infectious. Children <5 years of age with untreated TB are at an increased risk of developing severe forms of TB, such as miliary or meningeal TB; thus, appropriate investigations and treatment need to be initiated promptly upon suspicion of TB, often without microbiologic confirmation.​[[16]](#CTBSChapter9)​[[41]](#GrahamSM-7040FE9A)

Dosing of TB medications in children is determined by weight (mg/kg); note that dosing ranges (per kg) are different than adult dosing ranges for some medications (see [Table 7](#c0094n00023)). Regimens recommended in children are similar to those used in adults, although caution is advised with ethambutol use in young children who cannot be assessed reliably for visual toxicity.

Children <5 years of age who are exposed to an infectious case and initially TST-negative may be eligible for primary preventive therapy (also referred to as “window period prophylaxis”) with rifampin or isoniazid (or as guided by known drug sensitivities) until a repeat TST is performed 8–12 weeks after the last break in exposure.​[[16]](#CTBSChapter9) Consult a TB specialist when exposures include children <6 months of age, as TST results may be difficult to interpret.

### Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis

The basic principles of management for extrapulmonary TB are similar to pulmonary TB. However, prolonged treatment (≥9–12 months) is recommended for CNS TB (including TB meningitis) and may also be required in certain cases of disseminated or bone and joint TB with high-risk features.​[[17]](#CTBSChapter7)

In general, adjunctive corticosteroids are routinely indicated for meningeal TB, as they have been shown to decrease short-term mortality.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[42]](#c0094n00350) For pericardial disease, corticosteroids are recommended for HIV-negative patients, but not for HIV-positive patients who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). At present, no recommendation can be made for HIV-positive patients taking ART; corticosteroids should be considered on a case-by-case basis.​[[17]](#CTBSChapter7) Adjunctive corticosteroids may also have a role in TB-related adrenal insufficiency, airway compromise secondary to intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and life-threatening disseminated disease.

Always consult a TB specialist when treating a person for CNS TB or TB pericardial disease.

### HIV Infection

Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion because patients with HIV infection who develop TB can be asymptomatic and have other atypical clinical and radiologic findings. Miliary and disseminated disease are more common with lower CD4 counts. Sputum smears are often negative, while blood and stool cultures for mycobacteria may be positive for both TB and nontuberculous mycobacteria.​[[13]](#CTBSChapter10-718173B7)​[[43]](#SchutzC-7041D7BE)​[[44]](#Oramasionwu-7041EC68)​[[45]](#AbayeGE-704200F0)

People living with HIV and TB co-infection should be managed by health-care providers with expertise in these areas. Consultation with a TB or HIV specialist with experience managing HIV-related TB is strongly recommended due to extensive drug interactions and the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). For more information on the treatment of HIV, see HIV Infection: Treatment.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Active Tuberculosis and Pregnancy

Diagnosis of TB disease in pregnancy may be more difficult as symptoms of fatigue or malaise may be considered normal, and pregnant patients with TB can also be asymptomatic due to pregnancy-related immune suppression.​[[46]](#c0094n00427) Clinical response to TB therapy is similar to the general population, although pregnant and postpartum patients may have higher risks of hepatotoxicity.​[[47]](#Malhamxe9ICormierMSugarmanJEtAl.Lat-6EE9FC7D)

TB during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes (including increased mortality), and infants born to patients with TB disease are at a higher risk for prematurity or low birth weight. Moreover, people with TB disease in pregnancy may transmit Mtb to the baby during gestation (known as congenital TB) or in the postpartum period.​[[48]](#c0094n00430) Therefore, those who are pregnant with suspected TB disease should be thoroughly investigated through standard diagnostic procedures, including sputum specimens and a single posterior-anterior chest x-ray with double shielding (front and back) of the abdomen. TB disease is not an indication for termination of pregnancy, but counselling should be provided by a TB specialist (in collaboration with obstetrics) for patients with drug-resistant disease, as commonly used second-line drugs have potential teratogenic effects.

### Management of Tuberculosis Disease in Pregnancy

Treatment of TB disease should not be withheld during pregnancy or the postpartum period, as the risk of untreated TB disease outweighs the risk of adverse events from TB therapy. The preferred initial treatment regimen includes isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)​[[35]](#CTBSChapter5-717B8E65) These drugs can cross the placenta, but teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated.​[[49]](#c0094n00431) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is also recommended in pregnant patients who are prescribed isoniazid. The use of pyrazinamide in pregnancy has been controversial in North America due to a lack of robust teratogenicity data; however, it is recommended by the WHO and widely used elsewhere in the world.​[[27]](#WHO_TB2017) Pyrazinamide should be considered in the treatment of pregnant patients with advanced HIV, extensive/disseminated disease or smear-positive pulmonary TB.​[[13]](#CTBSChapter10-718173B7)​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5) If pyrazinamide is excluded from the regimen, the treatment duration should be extended to a minimum of 9 months.

A patient in labour with infectious TB should wear an appropriate mask, and airborne precautions must be in place until the patient is deemed no longer infectious. If the patient is suspected of having TB disease or known to be infectious in the postpartum period, every effort should be made to prevent further exposure to the newborn. Separation may be required if the patient is considered infectious or has drug-resistant TB, although this should only be done as a last resort considering the associated adverse effects. Separation is not necessary if the patient and the infant are already receiving appropriate therapy for TB disease and prevention, respectively. Priority should be given to appropriate investigation and treatment of the newborn and consultation with a TB specialist is recommended.

### Tuberculosis Infection in Pregnancy

Pregnancy is not by itself an indication to be screened for TB infection; however, patients with very high risk for progression to disease (e.g., living with HIV) may be screened, since positive test results may warrant treatment during pregnancy. Chest radiographs should still be used in pregnant patients; a single posterior-anterior chest radiograph with double (front and back) shielding of the abdomen is recommended for patients with positive TST or IGRA results, or if symptomatic.

People with childbearing potential who are receiving TPT should be advised to avoid pregnancy. If a person becomes pregnant while on TPT, continuation of the regimen should be considered on a case-by-case basis. In patients without high risk of disease, TPT can be deferred until 3 months postpartum to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity. If treatment is undertaken, rifampin for 4 months is the preferred regimen.​[[4]](#CTBSChapter6-717323B2) In cases where isoniazid therapy is unavoidable during pregnancy or the postpartum period, patients must be monitored carefully for hepatotoxicity and concomitant pyridoxine therapy should be administered.​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5)

### Management during Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in patients receiving first-line therapy (e.g., isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). The small concentrations of these drugs in breast milk have not been shown to cause toxicity in infants.​[[50]](#Mathad-945B27AA) Breast milk also does not provide adequate serum concentrations for treating an infant. Pyridoxine therapy is recommended for all breastfeeding patients on isoniazid. Breastfed infants of patients taking isoniazid do not require supplemental pyridoxine if the infants are not taking isoniazid themselves.​[[16]](#CTBSChapter9)​[[26]](#NahidPDormanSEAlipanahNEtAl.Officia-70F3DED5) Consultation with a TB specialist is recommended before breastfeeding while taking second-line therapy.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Provide treatment support to people affected by TB, which may include financial and/or social assistance. DOT should be considered, especially in patients with a history of treatment failure or relapse, drug resistance, HIV infection, substance use disorder, mental health issues or homelessness.
- Be mindful of potential drug interactions associated with rifampin (and to a lesser extent rifabutin), which may necessitate dosing changes for affected drugs as well as close monitoring.
- Consider omitting pyrazinamide in older patients and others with a high risk of hepatotoxicity.
- Prescribe pyridoxine in adults and children taking isoniazid to prevent peripheral neuropathy, especially in those with poor nutrition, HIV infection, alcohol or substance use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, seizure disorders or other conditions that might predispose to neuropathy. The dose of pyridoxine can be titrated up to 100 mg/day if peripheral neuropathy develops. Pregnant and breastfeeding patients taking isoniazid should also receive pyridoxine supplementation.
- In patients who experience GI symptoms while on treatment, evaluate for drug-induced hepatitis and review any concomitant/new medications. Before switching to a second-line agent due to GI intolerance, consider administering first-line TB drugs with a small amount of food, changing the administration time or using pharmacological agents (e.g., antiemetics, antacids) to treat the symptoms.
- TDM can be used to guide dosing in patients with drug-resistant TB, liver or kidney dysfunction, or malabsorption.
