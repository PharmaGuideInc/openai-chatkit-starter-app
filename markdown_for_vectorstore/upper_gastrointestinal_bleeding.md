### Introduction

Upper GI bleeding (UGIB) is a common medical emergency, especially in older persons with comorbid conditions, and has a mortality rate of about 3%.​[[1]](#c0047n00114) Nonvariceal causes of upper GI bleeding are most common and include duodenal ulcer (DU), gastric ulcer (GU) and gastric or esophageal erosions. Less frequent causes include a malignancy affecting the upper GI tract, an eroded gastric blood vessel (Dieulafoy lesion) or a tear of the gastroesophageal junction (Mallory-Weiss tear).​[[2]](#c0047n00015) Gastrointestinal varices (enlarged veins) are found mainly in the esophagus and stomach and represent about 10% of all causes of UGIB in Canada.​[[3]](#Lu2014) The liver scarring found in cirrhosis prevents usual drainage of splanchnic blood flow through the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava; instead, the blood is redirected through a number of portosystemic vascular shunts. This results in an increase in luminal pressure in submucosal veins, i.e., the varices. The varices can eventually rupture into the lumen of the digestive tract and cause serious bleeding.​[[4]](#Laine2021)​[[5]](#deFranchis2022)

### Goals of Therapy

- Resuscitate (ABC: airway, breathing, circulation)
- Prevent hypoxia-related damage to other organs
- Treat appropriate lesions at early gastroscopy using endoscopic hemostasis
- Heal the underlying lesion with the judicious use of postendoscopic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
- Prevent recurrences of UGIB by managing, when appropriate, the cause of the bleed (e.g., Helicobacter pylori, NSAIDs) or precipitating factors (antithrombotic therapy discontinuation or continued use only with concomitant PPI prophylaxis)

### Investigations

- History and physical examination:

  - Resuscitate immediately to ensure the patient is breathing and to restore circulating blood volume while quickly taking a focused history and performing a physical examination, especially to exclude signs of chronic liver disease.
  - The clinical presentation varies based on the site, rate and amount of bleeding, but can include coffee ground or fresh blood hematemesis, melena or hematochezia. These may be accompanied by dizziness, syncope, chest pain, dyspnea, altered mental status, tachycardia and hypotension.
  - The cause of bleeding may be suggested by the history: patients with ulcer disease may present with a history of abdominal pain, a past history of ulcer and/or use of ASA/NSAIDs, clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel.​[[6]](#c0047n00078)​[[7]](#c0047n00102) Patients with varices may present with stigmata of liver disease (e.g., icterus, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic encephalopathy or skin changes suggestive of liver disease) and/or have risk factors (e.g., alcohol abuse, infectious hepatitis B or C, long-standing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). Retching or vomiting followed by bleeding is suggestive of a Mallory-Weiss tear.
  - The prognosis is usually worse if the patient has multiple comorbidities, especially a malignancy or renal/liver disease. Higher risk is also associated with vomiting fresh red blood, passing red blood rectally, advanced age, tachycardia or hypotension. Formal risk stratification scales include assessments before an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), such as the Glasgow Blatchford score (see [Table 1](#TablePH_GBS)), or after an initial clinical assessment and EGD, such as the complete Rockall score.​[[10]](#Boustany2023) These help in predicting the need for admission, the need for an early EGD, rebleeding, mortality and the need for therapeutic intervention.​[[11]](#c0047n00118)​[[12]](#Bethea2014)​[[13]](#Monteiro2016)
- Draw venous blood for STAT type and crossmatch (usually 4 units of packed red blood cells or more depending on the severity of bleeding), Hb concentration or hematocrit, electrolytes, renal function (serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) and coagulation studies (platelet count, INR and PTT).
- A rapid estimate of blood loss can be made at the bedside: significant loss of intravascular volume is suggested by systolic pressure <100 mm Hg, a pulse rate >100 bpm and an Hb <100 g/L.
- An ECG is useful in older patients with suspected or possible ischemic heart disease and prior to the administration of erythromycin, to rule out a prolonged QTc interval.
- The approach to patients with massive bleeding (a rare presentation in upper GI bleeding) requires a protocol-driven dedicated approach that is beyond the scope of this chapter.​[[14]](#Callum2023)
- The role of the nasogastric tube:

  - There is no need to insert a nasogastric (NG) tube if the patient is currently or was previously witnessed vomiting blood or if a gastroscopy will be performed imminently.
  - In patients with melena or hematochezia, the discovery of fresh red blood in the NG tube aspirate indicates more severe bleeding and points to the cause being in the upper GI tract.​[[15]](#c0047n00081) In about 10% of patients with clinically unsuspected UGIB, a positive NG aspirate points to bleeding from the upper rather than the lower GI tract.
  - The absence of fresh blood in the NG tube aspirate may be a false negative finding if the tip of the NG tube has not been placed in the pool of blood in the stomach or duodenum, or if the source of bleeding is beyond a closed pylorus.
  - NG lavage is no longer routinely performed and has been supplanted by the use of prokinetics, which do not compromise the airway in order to achieve cleansing of the stomach prior to an early gastroscopy. In those patients with red blood in the hematemesis or the NG tube aspirate, erythromycin 250 mg IV can be administered as a single dose to promote motility 20–90 minutes prior to the EGD, as it decreases the need for a repeat EGD to find the source of bleeding, improves visibility by clearing blood from the stomach and shortens duration of hospital stay.​[[16]](#c0047n00119)
- An upper GI series (e.g., barium swallow) must not be performed in the patient with UGIB. The diagnostic accuracy is poor in this setting; it may obscure a clear field for a subsequent EGD. An endoscopic hemostatic therapy (EHT) cannot be performed if the field of vision is obscured by barium.
- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy:

  - Refer all patients with UGIB for an EGD after they are stabilized. The timing will depend on the suspected severity of bleeding, the likely cause and the patient’s general condition, but ideally should be done by a gastroscopy performed within 12–24 hours of patient presentation.​[[17]](#c0047n00083) An earlier timing of the EGD is recommended for patients suspected to be bleeding from varices but not for patients with nonvariceal bleeding, even when at high risk for a poor outcome, especially if adequate resuscitation has not been completed.​[[9]](#Lau2020)​[[18]](#Laursen2017)
  - A prompt EGD will identify the lesion in about 90% of patients. The most common EGD finding is a peptic ulcer or erosions.​[[19]](#c0047n00084) Inability to make a diagnosis is usually due to profuse bleeding and may require a repeat EGD or, rarely, angiography.
  - Prognosis may be established at the time of the EGD. A patient with a clean-based ulcer (an ulcer exhibiting no stigma of recent bleeding), presenting with a Glasgow Blatchford score of 0 or 1, who is stable, reliable and otherwise healthy and who has family support and transportation available may be discharged home from the emergency room after the EGD. In contrast, an older person with multiple comorbidities and/or a gastroscopy showing an actively bleeding lesion, visible vessel or adherent clot is at significant risk of rebleeding and should be admitted to hospital (see [Endoscopic Hemostatic Treatment](#c0047n00007)).
- A diagnostic test for H. pylori should be considered (high false-negative rate when performed in the context of acute bleeding; therefore, additional testing or treatment should be considered if negative in the acute setting).​[[11]](#c0047n00118)

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0047n00006) illustrates the approach to the management of acute nonvariceal UGIB, and [Figure 2](#c0047n00127) outlines the management of acute variceal UGIB. [Table 3](#c0047n00012) details the parenteral drugs used in the management of UGIB. [Table 4](#DrugTableOralTx) details the oral drugs used in the management of UGIB.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide adequate intravascular volume resuscitation, dictated by the rapidity of blood loss and adequacy of cardiorespiratory status to tolerate appropriate fluid replacement, in the form of crystalloid fluids if suspected nonvariceal etiology or in the form of blood products if a variceal cause is more likely. Data suggest improved outcomes will be achieved by adopting a more restrictive transfusional policy (e.g., transfusing patients when the Hb level falls below 70–80 g/L or higher) in patients without associated coronary artery disease or massive hemorrhage.​[[4]](#Laine2021)​[[11]](#c0047n00118)​[[23]](#c0047n00117)

Protect the airway, provide supplementary nasal oxygen and insert at least 2 large-bore (18 gauge or larger) IV lines. Fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stability are essential before attempting an EGD. In the patient with severe and continued active bleeding, intubation may be needed prior to patient sedation and EGD to prevent aspiration.

### Endoscopic Hemostatic Treatment

Endoscopic triage provides for assessment of the risk of the UGIB.​[[24]](#c0047n00085) In nonvariceal bleeding, single or multiple therapeutic modalities may be indicated, although injection of epinephrine alone is inferior and should no longer be practiced.​[[25]](#c0047n00088) Gastric and duodenal ulcers are the most common lesions in Canadian patients with nonvariceal UGIB. In the more serious lesions seen in an EGD, such as an ulcer with a visible vessel or active bleeding (oozing or spurting), endoscopic hemostatic treatment (EHT) must be used, as these modalities improve outcomes.​[[26]](#c0047n00016) EHT involves coaptive thermal coagulation, injection of 1:10 000 or 1:20 000 epinephrine in saline​[[27]](#c0047n00086) and/or mechanical techniques (banding, Hemoclip, staples, sutures).​[[2]](#c0047n00015) Hemostatic powders have become available and may be used as initial or rescue hemostatic modality.​[[28]](#Barkun2022)​[[29]](#Lau2022) More recently, over-the-scope clips have been shown to be useful in refractory cases and may be useful as primary endoscopic approach.​[[30]](#Schmidt2018)​[[31]](#Barkun2023)​[[32]](#Lau2023) Angiographic embolization is usually reserved for patients failing a second attempt of EHT, and surgery is reserved for refractory or special cases.​[[33]](#c0047n00121) A routine second-look EGD is suggested only in select patients at very high risk of rebleeding.

After EHT, the 30-day rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality are respectively reported to be in the order of 14.1%, 6.5% and 5.4%.​[[34]](#c0047n00063)

In nonvariceal UGIB, an EGD can be considered in patients who are anticoagulated (as long as the INR is not supratherapeutic for patients on vitamin K antagonists; the INR does not confidently reflect anticoagulation status for patients on direct oral anticoagulants) and in patients exhibiting a platelet count of at least 50–100 × 10​9/L. The presentation of GI bleeding while on an antithrombotic agent warrants a dedicated approach that is discussed in detail in the clinical practice tool accompanying the American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian Association of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline.​[[35]](#Abraham2022)​[[36]](#BarkunClinicalTool2022)

In bleeding esophageal varices, endoscopic variceal band ligation or sclerotherapy is highly effective in stopping bleeding and preventing rebleeding.​[[5]](#deFranchis2022)​[[22]](#Lee2024) Band ligation is preferred because there are fewer complications. For bleeding gastric varices, the tissue adhesive cyanoacrylate may be carefully applied. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided therapies have shown promise.​[[5]](#deFranchis2022)

### Pharmacologic Choices

When primary endoscopic treatment is indicated in patients with variceal or nonvariceal bleeding, pharmacologic therapy can be considered as adjuvant treatment to yield further improvement in outcomes.

PPIs, usually in IV form, may be considered prior to EGD and may result in downgrading of high-risk endoscopic ulcer lesions, but this has not been shown to improve outcomes.​[[4]](#Laine2021)​[[37]](#Kanno2022) In circumstances where an early EGD is not available, cost analysis supports the use of IV PPIs before EGD.​[[38]](#Al-Sabah2008)

### Nonvariceal Upper GI Bleeding

Optimal therapy for nonvariceal UGIB (see [Figure 1](#c0047n00006)) includes an early EGD (within 24 hours of the initial bleeding episode) and an appropriate EHT (depending on the nature of the bleeding site). Intravenous PPIs are required if an EHT is performed for active bleeding or a visible nonbleeding vessel; the best evidence supports using a high-dose IV infusion after successful endoscopic treatment, especially for patients bleeding from ulcers.​[[39]](#c0047n00095) Use of oral or IV H2-receptor antagonists is not recommended.

In patients with nonvariceal UGIB, high-dose PPIs (e.g., pantoprazole) via IV infusion or intermittent bolus dosing significantly reduce rebleeding, the need for surgery, the need for repeated endoscopic treatment and mortality among patients at highest risk (having first undergone a successful EHT for active bleeding, a visible nonbleeding vessel or an adherent clot).​[[39]](#c0047n00095)​[[40]](#c0047n00100)​[[41]](#c0047n00056)​[[42]](#c0047n00057)​[[43]](#c0047n00019)​[[44]](#c0047n00021) Since most episodes of recurrent bleeding occur during the first 3 days after successful treatment, evidence supports the use of IV PPIs for 72 hours after EHT (e.g., high-dose IV pantoprazole 80 mg bolus followed by a 72-hour continuous infusion of 8 mg/h).​[[45]](#c0047n00103) In patients presenting with a bleeding ulcer while on cardioprotective doses of ASA, continued use of ASA or reintroduction within 3–5 days post EGD if it has been stopped, is recommended.​[[35]](#Abraham2022)​[[46]](#c0047n00132)​[[47]](#c0047n00133)

Pantoprazole and omeprazole are the most extensively studied parenteral PPIs for UGIB, but IV omeprazole is not approved in Canada. Intravenous pantoprazole is administered by continuous infusion or intermittent dosing ([Table 3](#c0047n00012)). After 3 days of IV therapy, switching to an oral PPI ([Table 4](#DrugTableOralTx)) is indicated to heal the associated ulcer, erosions or esophagitis. Where IV PPIs are not available, oral omeprazole 40 mg (or the equivalent dose of another oral PPI)​[[48]](#NICECG1842014) may be administered BID, although the data supporting this option are weaker.​[[49]](#LaineNEJM2016) Following discharge, the PPI is continued at a dose and duration determined by the cause of bleeding and the presence of ongoing risk factors for recurrent bleeding (e.g., ongoing ASA or NSAID use; see [Figure 1](#c0047n00006)). In high-risk patients (Rockall score >6) who have bled from ulcers, an oral PPI BID is indicated for the first 10 days following IV administration.​[[50]](#refitem-1132133-25AF10A5) Treatment is then continued based upon the diagnosis; patients with esophagitis continue oral PPI BID for a total oral PPI treatment period of 8 weeks whereas dosage is reduced to once daily in those with duodenal and gastric ulcers for a total oral PPI treatment period of 4 weeks for duodenal ulcers and 8 weeks for gastric ulcers.

Somatostatin and its analogue octreotide reduce acid and pepsin secretion as well as mucosal blood flow. Their exact role in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding remains largely undefined. More evidence for their efficacy and safety is required before widespread use can be recommended.​[[51]](#c0047n00097) Tranexamic acid has not been shown to improve outcomes and is not indicated in the routine management of patients with nonvariceal or variceal upper GI bleeding. It may be considered in select patients presenting with massive hemorrhage.​[[14]](#Callum2023)​[[52]](#HALT2020)

In the case of bleeding ulcers, treat H. pylori–positive patients with quadruple therapy for 14 days​[[53]](#c0047n00123) (see [Table 2](#TablePH_Hpylori) for recommended regimens), then continue PPI therapy for 4 weeks for duodenal ulcers and 8 weeks for gastric ulcers or esophagitis. Confirmation of H. pylori eradication with a urea breath test, stool antigen test or gastric biopsy is required because of high rebleeding rates in patients with a history of bleeding ulcers.​[[54]](#c0047n00098) If H. pylori has not cleared, re-treat with appropriate second-line therapy (see [Table 2](#TablePH_Hpylori)). Repeat testing to confirm eradication of H. pylori at least 4 weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy (at least 10 days and ideally 14 days after PPI therapy is stopped).​[[53]](#c0047n00123)

If the patient has an idiopathic ulcer (not associated with H. pylori), or if the use of ASA/NSAID or antithrombotic cannot be stopped, they should continue long-term, secondary prophylaxis with PPIs for life to reduce the risk of rebleeding (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease).​[[11]](#c0047n00118) Some guidelines also recommend ongoing PPI prophylaxis after *H. pylori* eradication. Clinicians should document the lifelong need for PPI therapy due to an UGIB in the patient’s chart and on their PPI prescriptions.

**Table 2:** *Helicobacter pylori* Eradication Regimens

| Regimen | Dose x 14 days |
| --- | --- |
| PAMC (First line option; if treatment fails, use PBMT) | PPI amoxicillin metronidazole clarithromycin | standard dose BID 1 g BID 500 mg BID 500 mg BID |
| PBMT (Second-line option; if treatment fails, use PAL) | PPI bismuth subsalicylate metronidazole tetracycline | standard dose BID 2 tabs (524 mg) QID 500 mg TID-QID 500 mg QID |
| PAL (For PBMT treatment failure only) | PPI amoxicillin levofloxacin | standard dose BID 1 g BID 500 mg OD |

### Bleeding Esophageal Varices

PPIs do not play a critical role in the care of the patient with bleeding esophageal varices; however, they may be used after sclerotherapy to prevent or to treat esophageal ulceration associated with variceal banding.

Antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections is an integral part of therapy for patients with cirrhosis presenting with UGIB and should be started at time of admission. Antibiotics reduce bacterial infections, all-cause mortality, rebleeding events and length of hospitalization.​[[55]](#c0047n00124) The most common infections are UTIs, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, respiratory infections and primary bacteremia. Oral fluoroquinolones are recommended for most patients (norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily), but IV ceftriaxone (1 g daily) is considered in patients with advanced cirrhosis, in hospital settings with a high prevalence of quinolone-resistant bacterial infections and in patients on previous quinolone prophylaxis; these agents should be continued for the first 5–7 days.​[[20]](#c0047n00125)​[[55]](#c0047n00124)​[[56]](#GarciaTsao2017)

For bleeding esophageal varices, EHT (banding and, less often, sclerotherapy) should be supplemented acutely with pharmacologic agents aimed at reducing portal pressure (see [Figure 2](#c0047n00127)). The long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide reduces portal pressure and bleeding. Octreotide IV can be started prior to esophageal banding and continued for up to 5 days following the procedure.​[[20]](#c0047n00125) For bleeding gastric or duodenal varices, injection of tissue adhesives are indicated with or without endoscopic ultrasound guidance.​[[5]](#deFranchis2022)

Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (ideally within 24 h) should be considered in patients with a high risk of treatment failure (e.g., Child-Pugh class C >14 points or class B with active bleeding) or after early recurrent bleeding or failed endoscopic hemostasis.​[[5]](#deFranchis2022) In patients failing initial management who continue to bleed, bridging to more definitive therapy can be carried out by inserting an esophageal balloon tamponade tube or dedicated esophageal self-expandable stent.​[[57]](#refitem-1132139-25B48F94)

### Secondary Prevention of Variceal Bleeding

First-line therapy in secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding for all patients is the combination of a nonselective beta blocker (e.g., propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) with endoscopic variceal band ligation.​[[5]](#deFranchis2022) The nonselective beta blocker should be reduced or discontinued if a patient develops a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) or an acute kidney injury.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

EHT can be performed in the pregnant patient with an upper GI bleed; preferably avoiding thermal unipolar electrocoagulation modalities. Suitable monitoring of the fetus is necessary, and obstetrical assistance must be immediately available. PPIs are considered safe for use in pregnancy​[[58]](#c0047n00105)​[[59]](#c0047n00106)​[[60]](#c0047n00107) and may be utilized based on the endoscopic nature of the lesion. There is little available evidence on the safety of PPIs during breastfeeding; however, based on low concentration of PPIs in breast milk and the destruction of ingested PPIs in the infant’s acidic stomach, it is unlikely that PPIs in breast milk affect an infant’s development. Limited human data suggest omeprazole and pantoprazole are probably compatible with breastfeeding if a PPI is necessary.​[[61]](#c0047n00109)​[[62]](#Plante2004)​[[63]](#LactMed)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Early appropriate resuscitation and risk assessment of patients with UGIB is critical.
- Early EGD is recommended within 12–24 hours with appropriate treatment of variceal or high-risk nonvariceal lesions.
- Attention to long-term prophylaxis, when indicated, is critical in decreasing rebleeding.
