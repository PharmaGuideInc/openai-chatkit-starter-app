### Introduction

Constipation in children is a common problem with an estimated prevalence of 9.5% across the pediatric age spectrum (0–18 years).​[[1]](#Koppen2018) This number may be even higher among infants to early school-aged children around the time of toilet training.​[[2]](#Robin2018)​[[3]](#vandenBerg2006)

The majority of constipation in children is functional, which implies it cannot be attributed to another medical problem, e.g., structural or anatomical problems. Functional constipation is not simply a diagnosis of exclusion and should be made with the use of the Rome IV diagnostic criteria​[[4]](#Benninga2016)​[[5]](#Hyams2016) (see [Table 1](#RomeIVNeonateToddler) and [Table 2](#RomeIV)). While one should take a careful history and physical examination to evaluate for red flags, organic or secondary causes of constipation are generally uncommon and an extensive workup is rarely warranted.

Although risk factors for constipation in children include lifestyle factors such as diet and fluid intake, it is most often the result of withholding of the feces. Withholding behaviour stems from a desire to avoid pain associated with the passage of hard stools.​[[6]](#Levy2017) In infants, the introduction of semi-solid food or switching from breast milk to formula or whole milk are risk factors for constipation. While both sexes are affected by constipation, males are more likely to experience encopresis/fecal incontinence (the involuntary leakage of fecal material), something which can be more easily diagnosed once the child no longer wears diapers.​[[7]](#Kammacher2014)

Constipation can greatly affect a patient’s and family’s quality of life and often has subsequent effects on physical, social and emotional well-being,​[[8]](#Rajindrajith2013) as well as health-care utilization.​[[9]](#Liem2009)

**Table 1:** Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation in Neonates/Toddlers​[[4]](#Benninga2016)

| The presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms for 1 month in infants up to 4 years of age: 2 or fewer defecations per week History of excessive stool retention History of painful or hard bowel movements History of large-diameter stools Presence of large fecal mass in the rectum In toilet-trained children, the following additional symptoms: At least 1 episode per week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet |

**Table 2:** Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Constipation in Children/Adolescents​[[5]](#Hyams2016)

| The presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms occurring at least once per week for a minimum of 1 month with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome: 2 or fewer defecations in the toilet per week in a child of developmental age of at least 4 years At least 1 episode fecal incontinence per week History of excessive stool retention History of painful or hard bowel movements Presence of large fecal mass in the rectum History of large-diameter stools that can obstruct the toilet |

### Goals of Therapy

- Achieve regular, soft bowel movements that are not painful
- Break the cycle of voluntary/involuntary withholding and stool retention
- Decrease rectal distention (achieve normal rectal girth)
- Re-establish sensation and urge to defecate

It may take months to years to achieve the goals of therapy for childhood constipation, and relapses are common.

### Investigations

The diagnostic criteria for functional childhood constipation are summarized in [Table 1](#RomeIVNeonateToddler) and [Table 2](#RomeIV). There is no standard workup for children with constipation; diagnosis is based predominantly on history and physical exam and ruling out red flags (see [Table 3](#RedFlags)).​[[10]](#Tabbers2014)

- History:​[[5]](#Hyams2016)

  - Onset
  - Frequency of bowel movements
  - Size/diameter of stools
  - Abdominal pain
  - Pain with passage of bowel movements
  - Posturing/holding behaviours (stool retention)
  - Incidents of fecal incontinence in children with toileting skills

  Changes in stool frequency in infants: in the first 3 months of life, especially in infants who are exclusively breastfed, stool frequency decreases from up to 6 times per day to 2–3 times per day. There tends to be less fluctuation if infants are formula-fed, and the average number of stools is less.​[[13]](#denHertog2012) Conversely, infants who are exclusively breastfed may have longer periods (even days) between bowel movements; this should not be cause for concern or intervention if there is no distress or hard bowel movements.​[[14]](#Courdent2014)

  Abdominal pain: constipation is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in children, and pain may be the chief presenting complaint with an under-recognition of stool changes or stool retention.​[[15]](#LoeningBaucke2007)

  Fecal incontinence/encopresis: accumulation of hard stool may result in the rectum being sufficiently distended to cause overflow fecal incontinence. Patients/parents may describe frequent, small-volume bowel movements, even diarrhea, and not readily associate these symptoms with constipation.
- Physical exam:
  - Abdominal exam: it is not uncommon to feel fullness/fecal mass in the left lower quadrant
  - Perianal/low back exam: it is not uncommon to see an anal fissure, which often is supported by blood when wiping and pain after the bowel movement
  - Rectal exam: confirms the presence of fecal mass but may not be necessary, as diagnostic criteria may be met with history alone
- Radiography: x-rays are often used to facilitate diagnosis of constipation in children; however, there is not a great correlation between imaging and symptoms of constipation, especially for mild to moderate cases, and an over-reliance on x-rays should be avoided. The role of x-rays may be limited to cases in which the diagnosis is not clear and abdominal exam is not possible.​[[10]](#Tabbers2014)
- Laboratory tests:
  - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): if there are other symptoms of hypothyroidism, TSH may be requested​[[10]](#Tabbers2014)​[[11]](#Chogle2013)
  - Tissue transglutaminase (tTG): may be requested but is not considered a first-line investigation​[[11]](#Chogle2013)​[[12]](#Sadjadei2017)
- Differential diagnosis:
  - Hirschsprung disease (congenital anomaly in which the bowel is missing nerve cells) should be considered if constipation presents in the first month of life. Additional clues include delayed passage of meconium (>48 h), ribbon stools, failure to thrive and severe abdominal distention. More severe presentations include bloody diarrhea (indicating enterocolitis) or bilious emesis (indicating bowel obstruction)
  - Spinal cord abnormalities may be indicated by deep dimples or hairy tufts in the sacrum; weakness in the legs; or weak deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremities
  - Anatomic abnormalities such as imperforate anus or anal stenosis should be ruled out. This may present as ribbon stools or a tight anal canal on rectal exam
  - Cystic fibrosis can be considered when there is failure to thrive and respiratory symptoms
  - Medications (e.g., opioids, anticholinergics) may cause or contribute to constipation
  - While routine screening is not warranted, other conditions to consider that may contribute to constipation include allergy to cow’s milk proteins (infants), hypothyroidism and celiac disease​[[10]](#Tabbers2014)
  - Infant dyschezia must be considered in infants who appear to suffer from painful bowel movements. Defined by the Rome IV criteria, infant dyschezia may present as screaming, straining and even turning off-colour prior to the passage of regular soft bowel movements​[[4]](#Benninga2016)
  - Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation (IBS-C) should be considered in older children and adolescents if pain is the dominant symptom and/or pain persists despite improvements in the stools.​[[5]](#Hyams2016) While the general principles of constipation treatment remain valid, other therapeutic approaches may be necessary; IBS-C is often heavily influenced by psychosocial states, including stress and anxiety​[[5]](#Hyams2016)

**Table 3:** Red Flag Signs and Symptoms in Children with Constipation

| History | Constipation onset in the first month of life Passage of meconium after 48 h of life Ribbon stools Rectal bleeding with blood in stool (no anal fissure present) |
| Physical exam | Failure to thrive/poor growth |
| Abdominal exam | Severe abdominal distention |
| Perianal/low back exam | Abnormal position of the anus Decreased lower extremity tone/reflex Tuft or hair on spine Sacral dimple Gluteal cleft deviation |
| Rectal exam | Explosive stool following digital rectal examination |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions are often discussed before or in conjunction with medication.​[[16]](#Koppen2015)

Educate patients/parents on constipation (especially when fecal incontinence is a presenting symptom). Explain that constipation in children is common, that it is unpleasant for the child, and that the child may not fully sense the stool or the urge to defecate or be aware of their withholding behaviour. In addition, advise parents to:

- Ensure child has adequate water/fluid intake.
- Ensure child has a reasonably balanced diet including fruits and vegetables with a focus on adequate fibre intake, which should generally be calculated as age in years + 5 g.
- Encourage child to participate in daily physical activity.​[[17]](#CPSPhysicalActivityGuidelines)
- Establish a toilet routine/schedule; child should sit on the toilet for not more than 5 minutes, approximately half an hour after a meal to take advantage of the gastrocolic reflex, even if there is no detectable urge to defecate.
- Provide support for the child’s feet with a low stool when on the toilet, especially children who cannot reach the floor.
- Provide positive reinforcement for even just sitting on the toilet (many children respond well to reward charts). Reprimanding or punishing the child may make the situation worse.
- Monitor child for signs of withholding and encourage the child to have body awareness.
- Maintain a journal to objectively describe frequency and consistency of the stools, ideally using a common tool such as the Bristol stool form scale (see [Figure 1](#BristolStoolScale)).
- Consider an empirical elimination of cow’s milk proteins for a 2–4 week trial in children with difficult-to-treat constipation, particularly in infants.​[[10]](#Tabbers2014)​[[18]](#Dehghani2012)
- Consider osmotic juices, such as pear, prune or apple, for mild constipation.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Most children with persistent constipation will require pharmacologic therapy. Generally there is a clean-out phase to evacuate retained stool, followed by maintenance therapy. A written plan for clean-out and maintenance can be of significant value to the family. [Table 4](#dt-constipationChildren1) details the drugs used in the management of constipation in children.

The osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350) is the primary choice for most children despite the manufacturers’ standard disclaimer that it is indicated only for the treatment of intermittent constipation in adults. PEG 3350 can be used for both clean-out therapy and maintenance therapy.​[[19]](#Modin2018) For clean-out therapy, high dose PEG 3350 (1.5 g/kg/day) is not inferior to rectal therapy (enemas) even when fecal impaction is present​[[20]](#Bekkali2009) and it has the associated benefits of greater convenience and less discomfort, which can support breaking the cycle of withholding. However, the effect is not immediate; it often takes 24–48 hours for bowel evacuation to be achieved.

For maintenance, PEG 3350 has been shown to be more effective than other osmotic agents such as lactulose and to cause less bloating and abdominal pain.​[[21]](#Jarzebicka2019) Lactulose is considered a second-line agent and generally used only if PEG 3350 is unavailable. Mineral oil is also less effective than PEG 3350 and may cause anal leakage and staining of the undergarments; it should not be used in children <1 year of age or those at increased risk of aspiration. For all maintenance therapy, dose titration is often required and can be carried out by the family to ensure a soft ‘mushy’ (but not watery) stool is produced without any leakage.

Refractory cases may require the use of stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl.​[[22]](#Russell2015) One approach suggests using senna or bisacodyl if there are no stools after 3 days of therapy with an osmotic agent. While there is often a dogmatic teaching against the use of stimulant laxatives due to concerns regarding dependency and cramping, there is minimal evidence to support this,​[[23]](#VilanovaSanchez2018) especially if they are used on an as-needed basis. Stimulant laxatives may also provide stimulatory feedback for patients who have minimal sensation.

Newer oral agents such as prokinetics (e.g., prucalopride) and secretagogues (e.g., linaclotide, lubiprostone) have a negligible role in the treatment of pediatric functional constipation.

In general, rectal therapy should be avoided; however, glycerin suppositories are often used for immediate relief, particularly in infants. Enemas containing sodium phosphates are an option if bowel evacuation is desired. The administration of a rectal treatment is often challenging and requires assistance even if the child is cooperative.

Treatment duration for chronic constipation should be in months with full improvement maintained for at least 1 month before weaning therapy.​[[10]](#Tabbers2014) A fair number of set backs or relapses can be expected; these may be due to a change in schedule, diet, school attendance, travel, fears and phobias, or no identifiable reason. If a relapse of constipation occurs, a repeat of clean-out therapy may be required.

Risk factors for slower improvement or increased relapses include being male, having constipation before 1 year of age, having encopresis,​[[24]](#vanGinkel2003) having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),​[[25]](#McKeown2013) having neurodevelopmental disabilities,​[[26]](#Sullivan2008) or having a history of abuse or childhood adverse events.​[[27]](#Philips2015)

Despite highlighting the difficult course, most pediatric constipation will improve with support and time​[[28]](#Pijpers2010) and does not result in lifelong chronic symptoms.

### Therapeutic Tips

- The dosage ranges for PEG 3350 and lactulose are approximate; it is safe for doses to be titrated higher to achieve a soft daily bowel movement or lower if there is watery stool. These medications have wide margins of safety, e.g., an adult dosage of 238 g (14 capfuls) PEG 3350 may be used for colonoscopy preparation.​[[29]](#McKenna2012)
- If the dosage of PEG 3350 is increased, the amount of fluid used for mixing must be correspondingly increased; ideally 250 mL liquid should be used for each 17 g PEG 3350.
- While per gram dosing is described for PEG 3350, 17 g is approximately 1 capful or 1 tablespoonful. More common dosing regimens are rounded to 1, one-half or one-quarter capfuls or tablespoonfuls.
- Generous stirring (several minutes) is often required to completely dissolve the PEG 3350 powder.
- While some families prefer as-needed use of medication, in moderate to severe constipation, especially with fecal incontinence, a regular low dose is more likely to provide long-term benefit.
- In general, rectal therapy should be avoided, as it can enhance a child’s defensiveness/withholding.
- The parents’ attitude is key toward solving this problem; it is very important they not blame the child.
