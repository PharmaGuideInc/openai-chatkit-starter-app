### Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of this infection continues to evolve.

The focus of this chapter is community-based prevention and management of COVID-19. This chapter provides primary-care practitioners with information/links to guidance for prevention (e.g., vaccination) and outpatient management of acute COVID-19.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent the spread of COVID-19
- Alleviate symptoms
- Prevent complications where possible

### Assessment

### Clinical Presentation

The most common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection include runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and headache; other signs and symptoms include:​[[1]](#PHAC_Sx)

- Respiratory tract: sputum, cough (may be persistent), wheezing, shortness of breath or breathlessness while walking or talking (patients may also be provided with a home O2 saturation monitor for an objective measure of oxygen saturation)
- Thermoregulatory: fever, chills, rigors
- Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia
- Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia
- Neurologic: fatigue, malaise, confusion/brain fog, delirium, memory loss
- Cardiac: chest pain, arrhythmia
- Ears, nose, throat (ENT): anosmia, dysgeusia, hoarse voice, ear pain
- Psychiatric: anxiety, depression, insomnia

Most symptoms will peak at around day 4 of infection, begin to improve or diminish soon after and be completely resolved within 7–10 days; however, cough may be persistent in some patients. If symptoms are not improving by day 4–5 of symptom onset, encourage patient to seek further assessment.

Possible complications of COVID-19 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulation disorders, cardiac failure, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or long COVID) and death.​[[1]](#PHAC_Sx)​[[2]](#Murk2021)​[[3]](#postCovidCondition)

Risk factors for progression to more severe disease in adults include age >60 years, pregnancy, no prior vaccine dose, or comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia, diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m​2), cancer or immunocompromising conditions.​[[4]](#CDC_Sx)​[[5]](#HighRiskSevereDisease-4A8AB4D7) These risk factors will likely change since the virus is now endemic and new variants continue to emerge.

Evidence to support clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection in children is limited but the following may be should be considered: children that are medically fragile, have complex medical needs or have more than one comorbidity, including neurological disorders, chronic lung disease, Down syndrome or immunocompromising conditions.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

If any of the following red flags are present during patient assessment, consider assessment by the nearest urgent-care centre:​[[7]](#COVID_Assessment_Tool)

- Difficulty breathing
- Shortness of breath at rest
- Worsening of respiratory symptoms
- Cold, clammy skin; blue-tinged lips
- Confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness
- High fever

### Testing for COVID-19

COVID-19 symptoms overlap with a variety of other viral respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza, RSV, rhinovirus); thus, testing for COVID-19 prior to treatment remains the standard of care. Both at-home (e.g., rapid antigen detection tests [RADT]) and laboratory tests (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] tests) are appropriate for this purpose.​[[8]](#AMMI2024)​[[9]](#BCCDCTherMildModCOVID-578F395A) For more information, see [the BC Clinical Practice Guide](http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Professionals-Site/Documents/COVID-treatment/ClinicalPracticeGuide_Therapeutics_MildModerateCOVID.pdf).

### Complications of COVID-19

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)

An uncommon post COVID-19 infection complication is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). It appears 2–6 weeks after infection and, although rare, clinicians should be aware of this potential complication. Signs and symptoms of MIS-C include fever lasting ≥3 days, GI symptoms (pain, vomiting, diarrhea), fatigue, headache, dizziness, tachycardia, tachypnea, skin rash, or swelling of the lips/tongue or hands/feet and lymphadenopathy. Immediate medical attention is needed if the child is experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms: severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, cyanosis of lips/face, neurologic findings of confusion or altered level of consciousness.

### Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or long COVID)

Many patients report long-term health effects that may persist for months after recovering from acute COVID-19. They can also manifest weeks after resolution of acute symptoms. The Public Health Agency of Canada defines post COVID-19 condition as symptoms of COVID-19 that persist for more than 12 weeks after infection.​[[3]](#postCovidCondition) The most commonly reported long-term symptoms in adults include fatigue, insomnia, shortness of breath, difficulty thinking/concentrating, memory loss and mental health symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression).​[[10]](#longCovidSurvey) The pathology, epidemiology and risk factors for prolonged COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated, and evidence is still emerging. Current evidence suggests patients with certain characteristics are more likely to develop long COVID, e.g., having pre-existing chronic conditions, having experienced more severe acute illness (especially those who were hospitalized) and being female.​[[10]](#longCovidSurvey) (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients. Each patient should be considered individually*.) In addition to the ones reported in adults, common symptoms in children include headaches, myalgias, arthralgias and abdominal pain.​[[10]](#longCovidSurvey) In older patients, potential signs of PASC include gradual or ongoing decline in function, persistent deconditioning, worsening frailty, new or worsening dementia, and loss of interest in eating or drinking.

Further discussion regarding this topic is outside the scope of this chapter; for more information, consult the [Canadian Guidelines for Post COVID-19 Condition](https://canpcc.ca).

### Prevention

For more information on prevention of COVID-19, see [*Health Canada: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): prevention and risks*](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

General measures to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are the same as for all other respiratory viruses and include:

- Washing hands often; using hand sanitizer if water and soap are not available
- Coughing/sneezing into tissues (or into a sleeve if tissues are not available) and disposing of used tissues immediately
- Wearing a mask when ill and unable to be away from others, when caring for someone who is ill, when it is required in a particular setting, or as a personal choice. Children <2 years of age should not wear masks, visors, eye protection or other face coverings due to the potential risk of asphyxiation
- If symptoms are present, staying home from work or school and not visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities or individuals at high risk of complications from COVID-19 (e.g., infants, older adults)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Vaccination is currently the preferred pharmacologic measure for prevention of COVID-19; see [Vaccination against COVID–19](#COVIDVaccination).

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with sipavibart is approved for chemoprophylaxis against COVID-19 when vaccination is contraindicated or in immunocompromised individuals; however, it is not yet available in Canada. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab was previously approved for the same indication; however, it is no longer available in Canada since >90% of SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains were resistant to this combination medication when last studied.​[[11]](#evusheldUnauthorized)

### Vaccination against COVID–19

Vaccine recommendations are frequently updated, and all health-care providers are strongly encouraged to monitor for updates from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and local public health agencies.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) For a list of available vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, see [Table 1](#VaccineTable2).

COVID-19 immunization for all eligible persons is strongly recommended by public health units in all Canadian jurisdictions. COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be very effective at preventing severe disease, including hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 infection.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) NACI recommends that individuals stay up to date with their vaccines and be familiar with the most current guidance on vaccine formulation and timing.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)​[[12]](#CIG_COVID2025-26)

[a] For more information, see the individual product monographs for each vaccine, available from [https://cps.pharmacists.ca.](https://cps.pharmacists.ca)

[b] Actual dosing schedules may vary depending on vaccine availability, NACI recommendations and timing of a recent COVID-19 infection.

[c] May be administered concurrently or at any time before or after other vaccines (live or non-live).​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

[d] NACI states that individuals should wait at least 3 months since last COVID-19 vaccine dose or test-confirmed COVID-19 infection.​[[12]](#CIG_COVID2025-26)

[e] NACI recommends that the optimal interval between doses for primary series is ≥8 wk;​ however, in patients who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, an interval of 4–8 wk between doses is recommended.​​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

[f] NACI lists the conditions (e.g., malignancy, HIV, TB, HSCT within 2 years, CKD requiring dialysis) and medications (e.g., CART therapy, immunosuppressives) that can reduce immune response.​​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

[g] Cases most commonly occur after vaccination with the second dose, usually within a week of vaccination, more often in adolescents and young adults under 30 y and more often in males than females. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients. Each patient should be considered individually*.) Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, and sensation of rapid or abnormal heart rhythm. With the implementation of a 1-dose primary series, the risk is expected to be lower.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

##### Recommendations for those previously vaccinated

The current NACI recommendations regarding subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses in those previously vaccinated (formerly known as booster doses) are as follows:​[[12]](#CIG_COVID2025-26)

- NACI specifically ***recommends*** 2 doses per year for the following individuals:

  - those ≥80 years of age
  - those ≥6 months of age who are moderately or severely immunocompromised
  - residents of long-term care or congregate living settings for seniors
- NACI states that the following individuals could ***consider*** receiving 2 doses per year:

  - those 65-79 years of age and community-dwelling (i.e., not living in long-term care or congregate living settings for seniors)
  - those ≥6 months of age with underlying medical conditions (see [list](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/signs-symptoms-severity.html#a3))
  - those <65 years of age and living in long-term care or congregate living settings
  - health-care workers
  - pregnant individuals
  - members of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities
  - members of racialized communities
- NACI states that all other individuals ≥6 months of age ***may be offered*** one vaccine dose per year.

Additionally, NACI states that the minimum interval between vaccine doses (or after test-confirmed COVID-19 infection) is 3 months.​[[12]](#CIG_COVID2025-26)

### Therapeutic Choices

Consult local or provincial guidelines for the most up-to-date COVID-19 treatment protocols and algorithms.

Guidance on the treatment of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 is available from:

- Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (AMMI) Canada: [*Updated recommendations for treatment of adults with symptomatic COVID-19 in 2023-2024*](https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2023-12-07)
- British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control: [*COVID-19 Care—Treatments*](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/treatments)

Recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic outpatient management of specific COVID-19 symptoms can found in:

- Fever: see Fever
- Cough: see Acute Bronchitis
- Headache: see Headache in Adults
- Myalgia: there is no evidence for the management of myalgia due to COVID-19 specifically, but the following general information related to management of patients experiencing symptoms may be helpful; see Acute Pain and Influenza
- GI symptoms (less common): see Nausea and Vomiting and Diarrhea

Investigation of pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 is ongoing and the reader is directed to refer to a reliable source of frequently updated information such as Health Canada’s [drug and vaccine authorization list](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/authorization/list-drugs.html). The use of experimental medications that are not included in this list, are not discussed in this chapter, are not prescribed with the advice of an infectious disease specialist or are outside a clinical trial is inappropriate.

### Treatment of COVID-19 in Non-hospitalized Patients

In the outpatient setting, treatment for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms is usually supportive and based on the provider’s assessment of the patient’s clinical condition. For patients being cared for or recovering at home, standard treatment for cold-like symptoms and influenza-like illness is recommended. For management of fever and pain, both acetaminophen and **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs** **(**NSAIDs**)** are equally effective and considered safe choices.​[[13]](#MooreN-61C1EEC0) Similarly, patients who regularly take an NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid may continue to do so as previously directed.

In any setting (community, hospital, congregate care), mildly ill patients who are considered to be at high risk for severe disease may be eligible for treatment. In general, the degree of risk increases with age, vaccine status and number of comorbidities.​[[8]](#AMMI2024) Examples of high-risk patients include patients with moderate/severe immunosuppression or those ≥60 years of age with comorbid conditions, e.g., end-stage renal disease, insulin-dependant diabetes, severe lung conditions, severe intellectual/developmental disability or rare blood disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia).​[[9]](#BCCDCTherMildModCOVID-578F395A) It is also important to consider testing and treatment accessibility when evaluating patients from rural/remote communities.​[[8]](#AMMI2024)

Choice of therapy for symptomatic, mildly ill patients at high risk of progressing to severe disease will depend on the availability, contraindications, ease of administration of agents, and timing of a molecular or rapid antigen test relative to symptom onset. Antiviral options for nonhospitalized patients are presented in [Table 2](#TherapyMildModerate) and include:​[[9]](#BCCDCTherMildModCOVID-578F395A)

- Nirmatrelvir, a 3CL protease inhibitor that stops the replication of SARS-CoV-2, is combined with low-dose ritonavir, which slows nirmatrelvir’s metabolism.​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM) In vitro studies have shown nirmatrelvir to be effective against earlier variants of concern (i.e., Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda and Mu) as well as the Omicron variant.​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM) In placebo-controlled clinical trials, nirmatrelvir/​ritonavir demonstrated an 89% reduction in risk of hospitalization or death related to COVID-19 when this agent was started within 3 days of symptom onset and an 85% risk reduction if started within 5 days of symptom onset.​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM) Nirmatrelvir/​ritonavir is administered PO BID × 5 days and dose adjustment is required in moderate-to-severe renal impairment. Patient eligibility for this treatment is defined by the following factors:​[[9]](#BCCDCTherMildModCOVID-578F395A)
  - a positive COVID-19 test (molecular or rapid-antigen tests are acceptable)
  - treatment initiation within 5 days of symptom onset
  - a thorough review of patient’s drug profile to identify any potential contraindicated therapies (i.e., CYP3A inducers or inhibitors); consult a reputable drug interaction resource for potential drug-drug interactions​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM)
- Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue antiviral approved in nonhospitalized adults who are at risk for progression to severe disease.​[[15]](#VekluryPM) A randomized clinical trial from 2021 demonstrated the benefit of a 3-day course of remdesivir in this patient population.​[[16]](#GottliebRL-587CC052) Remdesivir may be used in patients with contraindications to nirmatrelvir/​ritonavir; dose adjustment is required in severe renal impairment. It is available only through IV infusion and should be started within 7 days of symptom onset.​[[9]](#BCCDCTherMildModCOVID-578F395A)

AMMI Canada recommends against the use of nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., fluvoxamine or oral or inhaled corticosteroids) for the outpatient management of COVID-19 since antiviral agents have stronger evidence to support their use in the prevention of hospitalization and death secondary to COVID-19.​[[8]](#AMMI2024)

Discussion on the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients is outside the scope of this chapter

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancy

Although pregnant individuals are not at higher risk for COVID-19, the risk of developing severe disease is greater compared to nonpregnant patients of the same age.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) In general, most babies of patients who have COVID-19 are born healthy at term; however, there is an increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) Risk for severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy is compounded in the presence of other known risk factors such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, hypertension and heart disease, as well as advanced gestational age at time of infection.​[[17]](#Aabakke-A69ACFF3)

Vertical transmission of COVID-19 is a rare event.​[[18]](#Ashraf-8B77C412)​[[19]](#MeloGC-8B77E5EA)​[[20]](#CanPedsSoc_BF) Care of infants born to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection should be undertaken in accordance with local infection prevention and control (IPAC) practices. Testing of infants born to patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 results is not routinely recommended; swabs of infants should be based on clinical symptoms and differential diagnosis criteria.​[[20]](#CanPedsSoc_BF)

### COVID-19 Infection in Breastfeeding

Although current information is limited, it is unlikely that COVID-19 is transmitted via breast milk. It is recommended that individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 continue to breastfeed their infant if they are able, taking appropriate precautions while doing so. If an individual is too ill to breastfeed, they may choose to use a breast pump. Appropriate precautions include:​[[20]](#CanPedsSoc_BF)

- Washing hands prior to holding the baby
- Washing hands before handling bottles, breast pump or other equipment
- Wearing a mask while holding or feeding the baby
- While holding or feeding the baby, coughing and sneezing away from the baby

### Prevention of COVID-19

Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should be offered vaccination against COVID-19 (primary series and/or subsequent doses) at any time during pregnancy if they are eligible and no other contraindications exist.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) As with all patients, informed consent of the pregnant individual should include a discussion of the risks and symptoms of adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) COVID-19 vaccination is safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. The rates of local and systemic adverse effects to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are the same as those in the general population.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) No increase in adverse birth outcomes (e.g., miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, low birth weight, preterm birth, NICU admission) have been observed.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)​[[21]](#MagnusMC-4E01F1B0) Vaccination of the breastfeeding individual did not affect milk production or excretion.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID) Enrolment in COVID-19 vaccine registries is encouraged for anyone who receives these vaccines during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[[6]](#CIG_COVID)

### Treatment of COVID-19

Information on the safety of approved therapies for COVID-19 is listed below:

- There is no human data available on the risk of birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal or maternal outcomes associated with the use of **nirmatrelvir** during pregnancy; nirmatrelvir/​ritonavir should not be used in this population unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM) The concentration of nirmatrelvir in breast milk is low; ritonavir is transferred into breast milk and low levels were found in some breastfed infants.​[[22]](#LactMed-E8D4B39A) Thus, due to a lack of data on the effects of this medication on the infant and on milk production, it is not recommended to take this combination medication while breastfeeding unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the infant.​[[14]](#PaxlovidPM)
- There is no data on the use of remdesivir in pregnancy, and the benefit versus risk must be weighed for each individual.​[[15]](#VekluryPM) The concentration of remdesivir in breast milk is very low. It has poor oral absorption, and no adverse effects have been reported in remdesivir-exposed infants (N = 5); as such, individual receiving remdesivir do not need to avoid breastfeeding, but careful monitoring of the breastfed infant is recommended.​[[22]](#LactMed-E8D4B39A)

**Drug Class: Nucleotide Analogue**

| remdesivir Veklury Distribution limited to specialized facilities. | Treatment of Nonhospitalized high-risk adults: 200 mg IV infusion on day 1, 100 mg IV infusion on days 2 and 3 If eGFR <30 mL/min and not on dialysis: 200 mg IV infusion then 100 mg IV infusion 48 h later​ [9] Dialysis: 200 mg IV infusion post-dialysis then 100 mg IV infusion post–dialysis 48–72 h later​ [9] | Elevated transaminase levels, headache, nausea, rash. | Studies have not been conducted on potential interactions between remdesivir and inhibitors or inducers of the hydrolytic pathway, CYP 2C8, 2D6 or 3A4. A loss of efficacy may occur in drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are CYP 1A2 or CYP 3A4 substrates when coadministered with remdesivir. | Initiate treatment within 7 days of symptom onset. Hepatic impairment: Do not initiate or continue treatment in patients with ALT ≥5 × ULN . Also approved for hospitalized adults and adolescents with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. See product monograph for dosing recommendations. |

**Drug Class: Protease Inhibitor**

| nirmatrelvir /​ ritonavir Paxlovid Consult provincial distribution plans for access. | Treatment of Nonhospitalized high-risk adults: 2 tabs nirmatrelvir 150 mg plus 1 tab ritonavir 100 mg PO BID × 5 days If eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min: 150/100 mg BID PO × 5 days Product monograph recommends discontinuing if eGFR <30 mL/min; however, use clinical judgment and follow local practice recommendations | Mostly mild: altered sense of taste, elevated blood pressure, GI effects (diarrhea, vomiting), headache, muscle pain. Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving ritonavir long term. | Numerous potential drug interactions; consult a reputable drug interaction resource and/or the product monograph.​ [14] Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP 3A substrates. Some CYP 3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) may decrease plasma concentrations of both agents and are contraindicated. Ritonavir, a CYP 3A inhibitor, is contraindicated with drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP 3A (e.g., alfuzosin, ranolazine, antiarrhythmics [e.g., amiodarone], colchicine, lurasidone, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, triazolam, venetoclax) as it may increase plasma levels of these drugs. | Initiate treatment only after diagnosis with a positive viral test and within 3–5 days of symptom onset. Not approved for use in pediatric patients (<18 y). Pharmacist consultation is important to mitigate significant drug–drug interactions. Severe renal impairment ( eGFR <30 mL/min): not recommended according to product monograph. Hepatic impairment: Mild-moderate: no dose adjustment. Severe: not recommended. |
