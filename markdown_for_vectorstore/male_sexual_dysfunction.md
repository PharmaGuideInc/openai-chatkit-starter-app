CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “men” or “male” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

This chapter addresses erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation and low sexual desire. A careful sexual history is required to distinguish these 4 conditions since more than 1 may be present in a single patient.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to obtain or maintain an erection sufficiently firm for satisfactory sexual activity on all or almost all occasions. Addressing sexual function is an integral part of general medical assessment, not only in patients with chronic illness​[[1]](#c0078n00113) but in apparently healthy patients, as impairment can signal serious disease. Of note is the frequency with which vascular ED precedes evidence of coronary artery disease​[[2]](#Miner2019) and is a potent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure in individuals with cardiovascular disease.​[[3]](#Zhao2019) As vascular ED affects all erections, all patients should be asked about their ability to obtain or maintain erections.​[[4]](#c0078n00164) There is a strong multidimensional relationship between ED, coronary artery disease and depression such that the presence of 1 of the triad necessitates inquiry about the other 2.​[[5]](#c0078n00165) Successful treatment of ED improves self-esteem, confidence, symptoms of depression and sexual relationships.​[[6]](#c0078n00217)

Premature ejaculation (PE) is defined as ejaculation that occurs sooner than desired, causing the individual distress. Although orgasm and ejaculation are separate physiological events, they occur simultaneously even when delayed by medication. PE may be acquired or lifelong.

Delayed ejaculation is a marked delay or inability to achieve ejaculation despite the desire to do so and despite adequate sexual stimulation. Prevalence is unclear because the definition lacks precision. It is the least common sexual complaint in patients <50 years of age but incidence increases significantly with age.

Low sexual desire, referred to in the DSM-5 as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder (MHSDD), is a persistent or recurrent lack of sexual thoughts, fantasies and desire. However, it is well recognized in people of all genders.​[[7]](#c0078n00203) Depression, low testosterone, anxiety, insomnia, age and insufficient physical activity are associated with MHSDD.​[[8]](#c0078n00173)

### Goals of Therapy

- Treat underlying conditions and reversible causes of ED, PE, delayed ejaculation and MHSDD
- Address contributing psychological, emotional and interpersonal factors
- Assess the safety of resuming sexual activity after serious illness
- Choose safe and appropriate therapy for the patient’s circumstances
- Provide knowledge, understanding and reassurance; encourage realistic expectations

### Investigations

Assessment and management of erectile dysfunction is presented in [Figure 2](#c0078n00028).

Obtain details of patient’s chief complaint and psychosexual history (see [Table 1](#c0078n00053)) (including from a partner, if applicable), with attention to:

- Description of the problem and previously tried interventions
- Clues to potential causes (see [Table 2](#c0078n00007))
- Childhood experiences that may have affected ability to be intimate or to feel emotions, especially for long-term dysfunction
- Past sexual experiences, both positive and negative
- Sexual context, i.e., arousal and enthusiasm of partner(s), erotic stimuli
- Negative thoughts during sexual engagement

  - for ED, e.g., fear of loss of erection, anger, resentment, distractions
  - for PE, e.g., fear of intimacy or of causing pain if a partner is involved, lack of sexual skill, feelings of guilt or shame associated with sex
  - for delayed ejaculation with a partner only, e.g., fear of intimacy, hesitancy to explain needed method of stimulation
- Other personal, psychological and interpersonal issues that may contribute to, or may hinder, the efficacy of pharmacotherapy

**Table 1:** Questions to Clarify Sexual History and Current Sexual Status

| People can have low sexual desire and difficulties with erections, reaching orgasm too quickly, too slowly or not at all. What are your main concerns? For how long have you had these difficulties? Do you have sexual thoughts or fantasies? If so, have they reduced markedly? Do you have the desire to self-stimulate/masturbate? Do you become aroused mentally if you see or hear something erotic? How sexually excited (in your mind) are you when having partnered sex? On a scale of 1/10–10/10 where 1/10 is a flaccid penis, 10/10 is completely firm and erect and 6/10 allows (but only just allows) intercourse, how firm are erections when you awaken from sleep (typically deep sleep), self-stimulate, have sexual play with a partner, attempt intercourse, as intercourse proceeds? Your experience of orgasm—has that recently changed? Are you reaching ejaculation—and has that recently changed? If you are having sexual activity with a partner, how rewarding is it on the occasions it is still occurring or when it was occurring? Despite these difficulties, are you still sexually active alone? with a partner? how often? Are the concerns with erection or ejaculation present with self-stimulation? What are your thoughts and feelings during partnered sex? (when the concerns about low desire, erection or ejaculation apply only to partnered sex) Do you feel your partner(s) experience(s) their own sexual difficulties? Do they think that they do? Would I be able to interview them? Are they in agreement with getting help for your sexual function and reinstituting sexual activity including intercourse, if desired? What effects have these difficulties had on you, on your relationships and on your partner(s)? |

**Table 2:** Etiologic Clues from Sexual History

| Clues in Sexual History | Potential Etiologic Factors |
| --- | --- |
| Sleep-induced and self-stimulated erections are firmer than erections with sexual partner(s) | Psychological factors: intrapersonal (e.g., insecurity, perfectionism, distractions, depression); interpersonal (difficulties within relationships); non-erotic sexual context |
| Premature ejaculation with partner(s) but slower when self-stimulated | Psychological factors: anxiety |
| Decreased sexual desire that causes distress to the patient (fewer sexual thoughts and fantasies) | Depression, low testosterone, stress, increased prolactin, medications, psychodynamic issues, e.g., a learned response not to feel emotions generally |
| Little desire for partnered sex but ongoing self-stimulation with or without viewing pornographic material | Intimacy difficulty—not strictly sexual dysfunction |
| Ejaculation delayed | Drug effect, low testosterone, advanced age with erection augmentation by drugs |
| Ejaculation delayed only with partner(s) | Psychological factors: intimacy difficulty; own method of self-stimulation different from partnered sex |
| Ejaculation early and painful | Prostatitis, other lower urological tract problems |
| Decreased orgasm intensity | Drug effect, depression, low testosterone |
| Erectile dysfunction generalized and lifelong in younger individuals | Congenital or past traumatic vascular damage, occasionally amenable to microvascular surgery |

Gather medical history with attention to:

- Reversible or potentially reversible factors and medications (see [Table 2](#c0078n00007) and [Table 3](#c0078n00032)), ED due to obstructive sleep apnea, depression, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes
- Irreversible factors, e.g., neurologic disease, some penile structural problems, pelvic surgery or trauma damaging pelvic autonomic nerves, vascular insufficiency
- Factors of questionable reversibility such as Peyronie disease; first 3–4 years after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy; smoking; lower urinary tract symptoms; chronic illness affecting energy, self-image, ability to pleasure partner(s); lifestyle issues including lack of exercise, obesity, fatigue
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (see [Table 4](#c0078n00054)) and discussion of risks associated with resumption of sexual activity, e.g., cardiac events or, less commonly, respiratory or other physical compromise or recurrent cerebral bleed

**Table 4:** Management Recommendations Based on Graded Cardiovascular Risk Assessment​[[13]](#c0078n00036)

| Grade of Risk | Categories of Cardiovascular Disease | Management Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low risk | •Asymptomatic, <3 major risk factors for CAD excluding age and gender •Controlled hypertension •Mild, stable angina •Post successful coronary revascularization •Uncomplicated past MI (>6–8 wk) •Mild valvular disease •LVD/HF (NYHA Class I) •Pericarditis •Mitral valve prolapse •Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response | •Primary-care management •Consider all first-line therapies •Reassess at regular intervals (6–12 months) |
| Intermediate risk | •Asymptomatic, ≥3 major risk factors for CAD, excluding gender •Moderate, stable angina •Recent MI (2–6 wk) •LVD/HF (NYHA Class II) •Noncardiac sequelae of atherosclerotic disease, e.g., stroke, peripheral vascular disease | •Evaluation by a cardiologist prior to initiation of any therapy for erectile dysfunction, due to risk of myocardial ischemia during sexual activity and orgasm •Specialized CV testing, e.g., ETT, echocardiogram •Restratification into high risk or low risk based on the results of CV assessment |

A physical examination is not required for a healthy patient with MHSDD. Perform physical examination for generalized ED, with attention to:

- Cardiovascular (CV) signs that may indicate irreversible vascular cause, e.g., bruits, hypertension, fundal changes, poor peripheral pulses, heart failure
- CNS signs that may indicate irreversible neurologic damage, e.g., multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury or diabetic neuropathy
- Late signs of hypogonadism including fine body hair, smooth skin, testicular atrophy, lessening of beard, gynecomastia, hepatomegaly
- Rectal exam to detect signs of prostate pathology
- When indicated, stress testing to 4 metabolic equivalents (METs) to identify silent or symptomatic cardiac ischemia that could occur with sexual intercourse and orgasm

Laboratory investigations with attention to:

- Total testosterone, calculated free testosterone or bioavailable testosterone, and prolactin levels, if the patient is identified as having a decrease in sexual desire or delayed ejaculation both with and without a partner

  - if testosterone is low, LH and FSH
  - if LH/FSH is low, investigate hypothalamic-pituitary function; consider hemochromatosis (imaging, serum ferritin)
- Fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, CBC and liver function tests as needed (abnormalities in these parameters may clarify etiology of ED, but correcting them is unlikely to improve it)
- Serum creatinine and calculated GFR
- For MHSDD: TSH (free T4 if LH/FSH is low and hypopituitary state is in question), prolactin
- For PE:
  - prostate examination if burning sensation during ejaculation
  - urinalysis and pelvic ultrasound if infection or bladder calculus suspected; cystoscopy may be indicated if other underlying pathology is suspected or ultrasound findings require clarification

### Erectile Dysfunction

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Address sexual avoidance by reminding patients and their partner(s) that reinstating sexual intimacy requires effort:

- The first priority is to make time to be together, away from responsibilities, to create a context appropriate for reinstituting sex
- Reintroduce sexual/sensual/intimate remarks and behaviours throughout the day to allow each individual to once again view the other as a potential sexual partner
- Address perceived negative consequences of attempting to be sexual together, e.g., performance failure, moral issues, or pregnancy or dyspareunia in patients whose partners are women
- Normalize sexual activity to include a variety of activities and not only penetrative sex
- Acknowledge and normalize the spectrum of asexuality

Address lack of subjective sexual arousal:

- Address intra- and interpersonal psychological issues identified in history that are contributing to the ED and/or would likely preclude benefit from pharmacologic intervention. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may be sufficient for situational ED​[[14]](#Bossio2018)
- For partnered patients, address sexual dysfunction/lack of enjoyment of partner(s)
- Address lack of useful stimulation/contexts

Address lifestyle factors:

- Exercise programs, active lifestyle and healthy diet have been shown to benefit patients with ED.​[[15]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed25727-9F380F73)​[[16]](#refitem-1222116-26B36AFF) Pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation with biofeedback, particularly in older patients, improves ED by augmenting venous occlusion​[[17]](#c0078n00218)

Vacuum erection devices (VEDs), also known as vacuum constrictive devices, create a vacuum and draw venous blood back into the penis. The blood is then trapped by the use of a retaining band around the base of the penis to attain adequate firmness for intercourse. There is a learning curve with the use of VEDs. Warn patients that the tightness of the retention band is critical and the band must be removed within 30 minutes after being applied. Some individuals cannot tolerate the degree of tightness required. Any condition that predisposes to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, sickle cell disease) is a contraindication to the use of a VED, as is warfarin therapy or other causes of increased INR.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 6](#c0078n00030) details the drugs used in the management of ED.

### Treatment of Underlying Causes

Although research is limited, in clinical practice combining psychological treatment with PDE5 inhibitors is common and evidence suggests that the combination is better than either treatment alone.​[[18]](#refitem-1222128-28338054) See Depression for more information on psychological interventions.

Treating cardiovascular risk factors with statins may benefit ED with or without the use of PDE5 inhibitors.​[[19]](#c0078n00220) See Dyslipidemias for more information on statins.

### Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors

PDE5 inhibitors include sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil. Given their safety, efficacy and oral administration, they are the drugs of first choice for ED, including antidepressant-induced ED.​[[20]](#c0078n00101)​[[21]](#c0078n00038)​[[22]](#c0078n00169) PDE5 inhibitors enhance an erection that is partially developing as a result of effective sexual stimulation and mental sexual arousal (or reflex erection in patients with spinal cord injury). There is less benefit in patients with diabetes; some evidence supports the addition of folic acid 5 mg daily to increase endothelial nitric oxide production.​[[23]](#c0078n00170)

Duration of action is longest with tadalafil (up to 36 hours); however, the effect of sildenafil​[[24]](#c0078n00115) and vardenafil​[[25]](#c0078n00103) may last longer (8–12 hours) than previously thought. Vardenafil and sildenafil have some affinity for PDE6 in the retina, accounting for occasional visual side effects. Tadalafil has some affinity for PDE11A, which may underlie myalgia associated with this drug. Absorption of sildenafil is delayed by high-fat meals. A meta-analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most effective PDE5 inhibitor and tadalafil is the best tolerated.​[[26]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed25817-947C3F73)

Contraindications to the use of PDE5 inhibitors include concurrent use of nitrates, symptomatic hypotension (PDE5 inhibitors are mildly hypotensive drugs), any condition in which even a slight lowering of systemic pressure is poorly tolerated (e.g., conditions restricting aortic outflow and volume depletion states), previous priapism and conditions predisposing to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis and sickle cell disease).

Careful concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with selective alpha-blockers (alfuzosin, tamsulosin) may benefit ED and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) more than either drug alone.​[[27]](#c0078n00212)​[[28]](#c0078n00213) Caution is needed when using nonselective alpha-blockers due to increased risk of hypotension when combined with PDE5 inhibitors.

Daily dosing of PDE5 inhibitors may improve erectile recovery after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.​[[29]](#c0078n00117)

### Prostaglandin E1 Analogues

### Alprostadil Intracavernosal Injection

If sufficient corporal erectile tissue is still present, injected alprostadil will cause erections even in the absence of mental sexual arousal.​[[30]](#c0078n00039)

Because alprostadil directly stimulates nociceptors, the technique, dose and dilution are critical for efficacy, safety and comfort of erection. Proper dilution and measurement of the dose are particularly important in neurogenic ED, which often requires doses of only 1–3 mcg. Doses up to 40–60 mcg may be needed for vascular ED.​[[30]](#c0078n00039) Priapism (a persistent and painful erection lasting >4 hours in the absence of sexual stimulation or desire) is most commonly caused by intracavernosal injections. Priapism is considered a urologic emergency and should be treated quickly (within hours of presentation) to avoid permanent penile damage. Risk of developing priapism is minimized by slow and careful dose titration of injected drugs.

Contraindications to the use of intracavernosal alprostadil include anticoagulation, previous priapism, symptomatic thrombocytopenia and conditions predisposing to priapism, e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, sickle cell disease and valve lesions with significant risk of subacute bacterial endocarditis.

### Alprostadil by Urethral Instillation

Instilling alprostadil in the form of a pellet into the urethra allows the drug to enter the corpus spongiosum. Retrograde venous passage from spongiosum to cavernosa is unpredictable and depends on the individual's venous anatomy.​[[30]](#c0078n00039) Therefore, a trial of intraurethral alprostadil pellets is necessary to determine efficacy in a particular patient.

By entering the communicating veins between the corpora, the drug is introduced into the systemic circulation, and hypotensive systemic side effects are possible.​[[30]](#c0078n00039)

Contraindications to the use of intraurethral alprostadil include symptomatic hypotension, previous priapism, conditions predisposing to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis and sickle cell disease) and distal urethral pathology.

### Premature Ejaculation

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The following sex therapy techniques may benefit patients interested in nonpharmacologic treatment options. They are not appropriate for individuals in a partnered relationship for whom referral for relationship counselling is the appropriate therapy.

- Adaptation

  - Ejaculation resulting from manual or oral stimulation can be the beginning of a more leisurely sexual experience for the individual with PE. If the activity then proceeds toward mutual sexual touching with a partner and then intercourse, the erection will return but the orgasmic response will be slower with the second erection.
- The following 3 techniques emphasize the appreciation of low intensity sexual arousal without a “goal,” e.g., of intercourse.

  - Stop/start technique: a series of experiences (6–12) where low-key stimulation, e.g., a hand, is used. When reaching moderate mental sexual arousal, the stimulation is deliberately stopped for 1 minute. It is then continued, to be stopped and restarted 4 times before moving on to ejaculation. These exercises can be used to slow down self-stimulated response, but typically the difficulty occurs mostly with a partner. The objective is for the patient to learn to focus and enjoy lower degrees of sexual arousal.
  - Squeeze technique: the stop/start technique is modified to include a brief, firm squeeze to the glans with the “stop.” This will decrease excitement more than just discontinuing the stimulus. Most clinicians do not recommend this addition because of the negative/painful aspects of the intervention.
  - Quiet vagina (for patients with partners who are women): to decrease the immediate excitement (and ejaculation) resulting from vaginal stimulation with movement, the woman sits astride their partner with the vagina containing the penis, but with minimal movement for the first 4–5 minutes.

Address possible sequelae of PE in both the patient and their partner(s), if appropriate (see [Table 5](#c0078n00033)).

**Table 5:** Sequelae of Premature Ejaculation for Both Patient and Partner(s)

| Low sexual self-confidence (which creates more anxiety, compounding premature ejaculation and possibly provoking erectile dysfunction) Arousal, desire or orgasmic disorder resulting from rushing on to (brief) intercourse, or simply discontinuing sexual engagement as soon as the early ejaculation occurs Intercourse itself never resulting in orgasm for partner(s) |

### Pharmacologic Choices

Clinically significant delay in ejaculation may be achieved with regular daily dosing of citalopram (20–40 mg), clomipramine (12.5–50 mg), paroxetine (10–40 mg) or sertraline (50–200 mg), or on-demand therapy with clomipramine, paroxetine or sertraline 3–6 hours before sexual activity.​[[31]](#c0078n00044) Regular daily dosing is considered more effective than on-demand treatment and may require 2–3 weeks for full therapeutic benefit.​[[31]](#c0078n00044) Most common side effects with these agents include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Relapse is likely when medication is discontinued. Combining pharmacologic and behavioural techniques is recommended to prolong benefit and ultimately allow gradual withdrawal of medication.

PDE5 inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of PE and possibly more effective than SSRIs. Ejaculation is delayed most effectively by a combination of PDE5 inhibitors and SSRIs.​[[32]](#refitem-1222132-2838F6B0)​[[33]](#refitem-1222133-283996E0)

Although not generally recommended, intracavernosal therapy in those with severe PE may improve partner satisfaction due to erectile persistence after ejaculation.

Numbing the penile skin with local anesthetic can be effective in delaying ejaculation but reinforces the patient’s inability to recognize lower states of sexual arousal.

Despite some evidence of benefit in patients with premature ejaculation, prescribing tramadol off-label for this indication is not recommended given the risk of dependence.​[[34]](#refitem-1222134-283A4747)

. . . . .

### Delayed Ejaculation

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- When delayed ejaculation is experienced only with partnered sex, consider having the patient explain to the partner(s) their preferred method of sexual stimulation that is effective when they are alone.
- When ejaculation is desirable for conception, suggest the patient self-stimulate until almost close to ejaculation and then enter the vagina.
- When delayed ejaculation occurs with both self-stimulation and partnered sex, address the various types of stimulation such as mental, visual, physical or use of vibrator (vibration-induced ejaculation may initially require a long duration of stimulation but this frequently shortens with practise).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Review the patient's medications and, if possible, change any drugs that may be causing the dysfunction, e.g., 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, alpha-blockers, antipsychotics, SSRIs (see [Table 3](#c0078n00032)).

. . . . .

### Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Provide patient and partner(s) with knowledge and understanding of sexual response cycle (see [Figure 1](#c0078n00207)). Explain the multiple reasons people have sex; desire (i.e., urge or lust) is just one of them. Once sexual activity begins and arousal is experienced, desire can then co-occur.
- Screen for and treat mood disorders, especially depression.
- For patients with a partner(s), counsel or refer to a therapist when their emotional intimacy is insufficient. Consider interpersonal factors such as:

  - poor communication of sexual and nonsexual needs and preferences
  - lack of stimuli
  - feeling unloved
- Address psychological factors that are inhibiting the effectiveness of sexual stimulation:

  - nonsexual stressors, distractions, e.g., the busyness of life
  - sexual self-monitoring (concern regarding erection or orgasm)
  - low self-esteem, poor body image, insecurity or difficulty with being vulnerable
  - feelings of shame over something in the past or having a sexual secret
  - a need to suppress anger or resentment leads to general suppression of emotions
  - concern regarding pain in a partner (or less commonly penile pain, e.g., with ejaculation)
  - feared negative outcome, e.g., sexual dysfunction of partner(s) or lack of excitement
- Address biological factors (in addition to depression) that are limiting the effectiveness of stimulation:

  - medications (see [Table 3](#c0078n00032))
  - fatigue, e.g., chronic ill health, sleep disorder, shift work, disturbed nights
  - comorbid ED or dyspareunia in a partner who is woman (address primary problem)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Testosterone replacement therapy may be effective for patients experiencing MHSDD associated with endogenous testosterone deficiency;​[[35]](#Httpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed26081-9F425330) however, the role of testosterone supplementation is uncertain in individuals who are not clearly hypogonadal.​[[36]](#refitem-1222136-2848C058)

Correction of hyperprolactinemia is expected to benefit low desire.​[[37]](#c0078n00215)

. . . . .

### Therapeutic Tips

- Sexual dysfunction involves all partners. Interview partner(s) whenever possible. There may be reasons not to intervene, e.g., one person’s desire for intercourse is low but they feel their partner expects/needs intercourse, when in reality the partner(s) is pleased that intercourse is no longer possible, never enjoyed it, experiences pain or discomfort during penetrative sex or prefers nonpenetrative sex.
- Sex is a biopsychosocial entity. If a patient's erections with self-stimulation are more firm and erect than with a partner, addressing the interaction between partner(s) is more relevant than drug therapy. Prescribing alprostadil addresses only the erectile difficulty. PDE5 inhibitors are unlikely to be effective, given the minimal arousal.
- Plan follow-up, since ED “drug failures” are usually due to lack of sexual arousal, poor technique with intracavernosal therapy or low desire in a partner.
- Reinforce the contraindications to the use of nitrates and caution with alpha-blockers.
- Assess safety of resumption of sexual activity in cardiac patients prior to initiation of any therapy—all partners may have concerns.
- Priapism is a urologic emergency most commonly caused by intracavernosal injections.
- For PE, the overall objective of the adaptation and sex therapy techniques (± medication) is to enable the patient to focus attention away from the act of intercourse and concentrate instead on enjoyment of the total sexual experience, including the pleasure given to and received from a sexual partner(s). Partnered sex can still be successful even if one partner has an orgasmic response long before the other(s) or if none of the individuals involved experience reach orgasm.
- For delayed ejaculation in older patients, explain that an augmented erection (e.g., with a PDE5 inhibitor or PGE1 analogue) can “over-represent” the degree of sexual excitement/subjective arousal without shortening the delay in ejaculation. The reason for delayed ejaculation in such circumstances is usually due to insufficient sexual stimulation.
- Nondrug-induced delayed ejaculation in younger patients, especially when requiring fertility assistance, usually requires assessment by a sexual medicine specialist.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: PDE5 Inhibitors**

| sildenafil Viagra , Sildenafil , other generics <$20 | 50–100 mg PO 30–60 min before sexual activity. Maximum 100 mg per 24 h. Not for daily use Start at 25 mg if patient is also using CYP3A4 inhibitors, >65 y or has renal/liver dysfunction | Headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, transient visual disturbances, dizziness, skin rash, priapism (rare), permanent vision loss (rare). Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and increased hearing thresholds at higher frequencies have been reported in users of PDE5 Inhibitors. | Contraindicated with nitrates (seek emergency care if chest pain present within 24–48 h of taking PDE5 inhibitor; not to be given for 5 days after stopping long-acting nitrates). May cause hypotension if used with nonselective alpha-blockers, e.g., doxazosin, prazosin. CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly decrease metabolism of the PDE5 inhibitor. CYP3A4 inducers may decrease efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor. | Onset of action may be as early as 15 min. Duration of action may be up to 12 h. Efficacy dependent on mental arousal. Dyspepsia and transient visual disturbances (impaired blue/green discrimination, blurred vision or increased light sensitivity) >10% with doses of 100 mg. Use with caution in retinitis pigmentosa. High-fat meal delays absorption. |
| tadalafil Cialis , generics <$20 | Once-a-day dosing: 2.5–5 mg daily PO On-demand dosing: 10–20 mg PO 60 min before sexual activity. Maximum 20 mg every 36–48 h Start at 2.5–5 mg if patient is also using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, >65 y or has renal/liver dysfunction | Headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, myalgia, back pain, visual disturbances (rare), permanent vision loss (rare). Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and increased hearing thresholds at higher frequencies have been reported in users of PDE5 inhibitors. | Contraindicated with nitrates (seek emergency care if chest pain present within 24–48 h of taking PDE5 inhibitor; not to be given for 5 days after stopping long-acting nitrates). May cause hypotension if used with nonselective alpha-blockers, e.g., doxazosin, prazosin. CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly decrease metabolism of the PDE5 inhibitor. CYP3A4 inducers may decrease efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor. | Onset of action within 30–60 min. Efficacy dependent on mental arousal. Duration of effect up to 36 h. Daily use is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment. Desirable in those who want more freedom in timing their sexual activity. No delay in absorption after food. Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. |
| vardenafil Levitra , Staxyn , generics <$20 | Levitra (film-coated tablets): 10–20 mg PO 30–60 min before sexual activity. Maximum 20 mg per 24 h Staxyn (orally disintegrating tablets): 10 mg dissolved on tongue 45–90 min before sexual activity. Maximum 10 mg per 24 h Not for daily use Start with 5 mg film-coated tablets if patient is also using CYP3A4 inhibitors, >65 y or has liver dysfunction | Headache, flushing, dyspepsia, rhinitis, sinusitis, transient visual disturbances. Slight prolongation of QT c interval. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and increased hearing thresholds at higher frequencies have been reported in users of PDE5 inhibitors. | Contraindicated with nitrates (seek emergency care if chest pain present within 24–48 h of taking PDE5 inhibitor; not to be given for 5 days after stopping long-acting nitrates). May cause hypotension if used with nonselective alpha-blockers, e.g., doxazosin, prazosin. CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly decrease metabolism of the PDE5 inhibitor. CYP3A4 inducers may decrease efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor. Do not use with quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone or sotalol due to increased risk of QT c prolongation. | Onset of action may be as early as 10 min. Duration of action up to 12 h. Efficacy dependent on mental arousal. Fatty meals decrease maximum blood concentration. Do not use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Orally disintegrating tablets and film-coated tablets are not bioequivalent. |

**Drug Class: PGE1Analogues**

| alprostadil (intracavernosal injection) Caverject $20–40 | Neurogenic ED: start with 1.25 mcg. If needed, may increase to 2.5 mcg then by 5 mcg increments to a maximum of 60 mcg Vascular, psychogenic or mixed ED: start with 2.5 mcg and titrate to response Severe vascular ED may require up to 40–60 mcg Erection duration up to 1 h | Penile pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, penile fibrosis, priapism (rare). | Increased risk of hypotension if combined with alcohol, antihypertensive agents or vasodilators. | Use 5–10 min prior to sexual activity. Do not use more than once daily or 3 times per week, at least 24 h between each dose. Caution regarding needle stick injury and risk of STI transmission. Stress strict sterile technique, especially if known risk of endocarditis. Stress one-time use of needle and syringe provided in Caverject kit. The initial dose is determined during self-injection teaching in the physician's office. |
| alprostadil (intraurethral pellet) MUSE $40–60 | 250–1000 mcg 10–30 min before sexual activity. Dose depends on venous anatomy rather than ED etiology. Onset of effect in 5–10 min | Penile pain, dizziness, syncope (rare), priapism (rare). | Additive hypotension with antihypertensives. | Do not use more than once per 24-h period. Monitor BP during in-office titration to detect asymptomatic hypotension. |
