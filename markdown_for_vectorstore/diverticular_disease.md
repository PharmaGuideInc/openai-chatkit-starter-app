### Introduction

Diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of saclike protrusions of the colon wall called diverticula. Diverticula develop when colonic mucosa and submucosa herniate through defects in the muscular layer of the colon wall. Up to 50% of people >60 years of age have diverticula; the majority remain asymptomatic and 10–25% develop complications such as diverticulitis.​[[1]](#Parks1975)

Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis, which can be classified as diverticulitis or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). Diverticulitis may be characterized as acute diverticulitis or chronic diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis can be complicated or uncomplicated, and chronic diverticulitis can be further divided into chronic recurrent diverticulitis or segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD). The categories of diverticulosis are represented in [Figure 1](#diverticulardisease).

This chapter outlines the assessment and management of diverticular disease within the ambulatory care environment.

### Goals of Therapy

Asymptomatic diverticulosis:

- Generally discovered incidentally on colonoscopy; there is no indication for therapy​[[2]](#Stollman1999)

Acute diverticulitis:

- Improvement in symptoms within 3 days of therapy and complete resolution of symptoms within 7–10 days of therapy

Chronic diverticulitis and SUDD:

- Decrease frequency of patient-reported symptoms and thereby improve quality of life
- Prevent recurrence of symptoms
- Prevent development of diverticulitis or its complications, including abscess, obstruction and sepsis

### Investigations

Initial evaluation of suspected diverticular disease may occur in the ambulatory care setting, although concerning signs on physical examination, laboratory data or imaging may warrant inpatient admission.

History:

- SUDD: patients often present with nonspecific GI symptoms that are similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including vague abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habit. The abdominal pain is often characterized as colicky in nature and may be relieved by passing flatus or having a bowel movement. Features that suggest SUDD include pain localized in the left lower quadrant, older age at symptom onset and male gender.
- Acute diverticulitis: patients commonly present with severe abdominal pain, typically in the left lower quadrant due to involvement of the sigmoid colon; right-sided diverticulitis is possible but is much less common. The pain is usually constant and may persist for several days prior to presentation. Approximately 50% of patients have had 1 or more prior episodes of similar pain. Nausea and vomiting have been reported in 20–60% of patients due to a bowel obstruction or an ileus due to peritoneal irritation.​[[2]](#Stollman1999) Constipation is reported in approximately 50% of patients, and diarrhea in 25–35% of patients. Approximately 10–15% of patients have urinary symptoms due to bladder irritation from an inflamed sigmoid colon.​[[2]](#Stollman1999)
- SCAD: patients typically present with chronic diarrhea, cramping and abdominal pain primarily in the left lower quadrant and, in some cases, intermittent hematochezia (bright red blood in the stool).
- In all cases, obtain previous abdominal imaging and colonoscopy results, if available, and determine family history of colorectal cancer or diverticular disease, nutritional status, dietary history, and smoking status.

Physical examination:

- Patients may present with fullness or tenderness in the left lower quadrant or, occasionally, a tender palpable loop of the sigmoid colon appreciated as a mass on exam.
- Assess for fever, which may indicate acute diverticulitis.
- Assess for vital sign instability, which may indicate sepsis from acute complicated diverticulitis.

Laboratory tests:

- Laboratory tests should be ordered to assess the severity of disease.
- Patients with acute diverticulitis may have a mild leukocytosis; however, the white count may be normal in up to 45% of patients.​[[3]](#Ambrosetti1994)
- Patients may have elevated inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
- Stool testing may be indicated to exclude other diagnoses or concomitant infections, e.g., Clostridioides difficile, culture, ova and parasites.
- Urinalysis may reveal sterile pyuria due to adjacent inflammation.

Further investigations to establish a precise diagnosis are warranted:

- Colonoscopy: patients who present with symptoms consistent with SUDD will likely receive colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. If acute diverticulitis is suspected, colonoscopy should be deferred until 6 weeks after resolution to rule out an obstructing colon cancer as the cause of diverticulitis (after the risk of possible perforation has decreased).
- CT scan: in patients in whom acute diverticulitis is suspected, the sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT for the diagnosis are 94% and 99%, respectively.​[[4]](#Lameris2008) CT findings suggestive of acute diverticulitis include localized bowel wall thickening (>4 mm), an increase in soft tissue density within pericolonic fat due to inflammation or fat stranding, and the presence of colonic diverticula.
- Abdominal ultrasound: although uncommonly used to confirm the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis, abdominal ultrasound may reveal a hypoechoic or anechoic structure protruding from a segmentally thickened colonic wall. Hypoechoic refers to tissue that is more dense or solid and appears darker than surrounding structures; anechoic refers to tissue that appears completely black. Ultrasound of the colon requires specialized training and is not commonly performed.
- Barium enema: used commonly in the past to confirm the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis, but is no longer recommended due to the risk of extravasation of contrast material if perforation has occurred. If performed, water soluble contrast should be used.
- X-ray: not useful for diagnosis.

### Therapeutic Choices

Therapy is determined by the type of diverticular disease suspected based on history (including severity and chronicity of symptoms), physical exam, laboratory data and imaging.

[Table 1](#SummaryTherapies) summarizes the therapeutic choices for the various presentations of diverticular disease, [Figure 2](#fig_id) illustrates the management of diverticular disease and [Table 2](#dtDiverticularDx) details the properties of the medications used to manage diverticular disease.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Fibre

It has long been accepted that low dietary fibre intake is a risk factor for the development of diverticulosis, and it is standard practice for providers to encourage a high-fibre diet in SUDD and recurrent diverticulitis. Dietary fibre is thought to reduce the incidence of symptomatic disease by decreasing intestinal inflammation and positively altering the intestinal microbiome; however, some studies have called the role of dietary fibre in diverticulosis into question and additional high-quality research is necessary to determine the exact role fibre plays in diverticular disease. Based upon the evidence available to date, the American Gastrointestinal Association (AGA) recommends a fibre-rich diet for patients with a history of acute diverticulitis​[[5]](#Peery2021) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends patients with diverticulosis maintain a high-fibre diet for life.​[[6]](#NICE2019) The AGA specifies that a fibre supplement is not a replacement for dietary fibre from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes.​[[5]](#Peery2021)

- In a cohort study of 47 000 patients (EPIC-Oxford), dietary fibre intake was noted to be inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease.​[[7]](#Crowe2011)
- A 2012 colonoscopy-based study found that a high-fibre diet did not protect against asymptomatic diverticulosis.​[[8]](#Peery2012)​[[9]](#Strate2012)
- A 2012 systematic review of a high fibre diet in the treatment of SUDD found a lack of high-quality evidence and varying results.​[[10]](#Unlu2012)
- A 2017 review suggested that single studies support the use of fibre (dietary and supplemental) in SUDD for reduction of abdominal symptoms, but limitations of the studies prevented drawing conclusions.​[[11]](#Carabotti2017)
- The 1990–2014 Nurses’ Health Study (comprising >50 000 patients) examined the correlation between diet and incidence of diverticulitis and found the risk of diverticulitis was significantly lower in patients with the highest intake of fibre (28.5 g/day) compared with those with the lowest intake (12.5 g/day). Patients who consumed the recommended daily intake of fibre (≥25 g/day) had a 13% lower risk for diverticulitis than those who consumed <18 g/day.​[[12]](#Ma2019)

#### Dietary Patterns

Looking beyond individual nutritional components to overall dietary patterns, the 47 000 participant EPIC-Oxford trial found those consuming a vegetarian diet had a decreased risk of diverticular disease compared with those consuming meat, after adjustment for fibre intake.​[[7]](#Crowe2011) A 2017 prospective cohort study of >46 000 patients found that a Western diet (high in red meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy) was associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis and a prudent diet (high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains) was associated with decreased risk. The dietary pattern of the previous 1–4 years appeared more strongly associated with risk of diverticulitis than the long-term diet, indicating a potential for short-term dietary interventions to modify the risk.​[[13]](#Strate2017) The AGA recommends a prudent diet (high in fibre from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes and low in red meat and sweets) and a vegetarian diet to reduce the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[[5]](#Peery2021) and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) recommends reduced meat intake to decrease the risk of diverticulitis​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

#### Corn, Nuts and Seeds

Patients with diverticular disease should not be advised to avoid popcorn, nuts and seeds. Patients were historically advised to remove popcorn, nuts and seeds (including foods containing small seeds such as berries) from their diets, as it was theorized that these foods could become lodged within the diverticula and cause inflammation or bleeding; however, there was little evidence to support the recommendation. In 2008, a prospective observational study of >47 000 patients concluded that consuming popcorn and nuts did not increase the risk of complications of diverticular disease and that there was no association between combined strawberry and blueberry consumption and diverticular complications.​[[15]](#Strate2008) The AGA and NICE guidelines conclude the evidence to support restricting popcorn, nuts and seeds in the diet is lacking and recommend against advising patients to avoid these foods.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[6]](#NICE2019)

#### Exercise

Regular, vigorous exercise should be recommended to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic diverticular disease. A low level of vigorous physical activity is independently associated with increased risk of diverticulitis.​[[16]](#Liu2017) A large prospective cohort study of 47 000 males 40–75 years of age with no known colonic disease at baseline found that patients with the highest quintile of total physical activity had a lower risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding over 18 years of follow-up.​[[17]](#Strate2009Activity) This association was seen only with vigorous activity, which included running. The AGA recommends routine physical activity to decrease the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[[5]](#Peery2021) and the NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend educating patients about the benefits of exercise to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

#### Body Mass Index

Patients with diverticular disease should be strongly advised to achieve and maintain a BMI within the healthy range (18.5–24.9). A high BMI is independently associated with increased risk of diverticulitis,​[[16]](#Liu2017)​[[18]](#Strate2009Obesity) and even moderate increases in BMI may increase the risk of diverticular disease as well as complications of diverticular disease.​[[19]](#Aune2017BMI) The AGA recommends patients achieve or maintain a healthy BMI to reduce the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[[5]](#Peery2021) and the NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend weight loss for overweight or obese patients to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

#### Smoking Cessation

Providers should encourage smoking cessation in all patients with diverticular disease. Tobacco smoking is associated with an increased incidence of diverticular disease and related complications; current smokers are at higher risk for perforated diverticulitis and a diverticular abscess compared with nonsmokers.​[[20]](#Aune2017Smoking)​[[21]](#Hjern2011) In addition, there was a dose-dependent positive association of diverticular disease with an increased number of cigarettes smoked per day. In an English study of over 65 000 patients managed nonoperatively for their first episode of diverticulitis, smoking and obesity were risk factors for readmission and emergency surgery.​[[22]](#ElSayed2018) The AGA, NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend smoking cessation to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

### Pharmacologic Choices

#### 5-aminosalicylic Acid

**5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)** derivatives (mesalamine/mesalazine) are generally used as first-line therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as they are potent anti-inflammatory agents. After oral or rectal administration, mesalamine is absorbed by colonic epithelial cells and its impact is related to its local (luminal) or topical effect. The rationale behind the use of 5-ASA derivatives in diverticular disease is that the development of inflammation in existing diverticula results in acute diverticulitis and that the pathogenesis of SUDD may be related to chronic low-grade inflammation.

5-ASA derivatives demonstrated efficacy in the control of symptoms in patients with SUDD in several studies.

- A 2016 systematic review of 6 randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of mesalazine versus placebo or other therapy (e.g., rifaximin, fibre, probiotics) in patients with SUDD found symptom relief with mesalazine to be more significant than with placebo or other therapies. Furthermore, the incidence of diverticulitis in those treated with mesalazine was lower than that observed with placebo.​[[23]](#Picchio2016)
- A 2018 systematic review of 4 randomized controlled trials (including 2 from the 2016 review)​[[24]](#Kruis2013)​[[25]](#Tursi2013) comparing the efficacy of mesalazine versus placebo in patients with SUDD found mesalazine was more effective than placebo for symptom improvement and diverticulitis occurrence.​[[26]](#Picchio2018)

Studies that examined 5-ASA derivatives for the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis after an episode of confirmed acute diverticulitis determined they have limited utility for prevention. Consistent with the results of these trials, the AGA, NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend against the use of mesalamine for the prevention of diverticulitis recurrence.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

- The DIVA trial assessed the efficacy of mesalamine, probiotics or placebo for 12 weeks in the prevention of a recurrent episode of acute diverticulitis. There was an improvement in global symptoms at several time points, but recurrence rate was low and not significantly different between groups.​[[27]](#Stollman2013)
- The PREVENT1 and PREVENT2 trials each randomized almost 600 patients with >1 episode of acute diverticulitis in the previous 24 months to receive mesalamine or placebo once daily for 2 years; there was no reduction in rate of recurrence or time to recurrence.​[[28]](#Raskin2014)
- The DIVA and PREVENT trials were included in a 2016 meta-analysis and a 2017 Cochrane review; both concluded there is no evidence to support the use of mesalamine to prevent recurrence of diverticulitis.​[[29]](#Khan2016)​[[30]](#Carter2017)

#### Rifaximin

Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed oral antibiotic that has been studied in the treatment of diverticular disease based on the premise that it might alter gut microbiota, but its role is not well defined. Several older studies describe efficacy of rifaximin in reducing symptoms in patients with uncomplicated disease.​[[31]](#Papi1992)​[[32]](#Papi1995)​[[33]](#Latella2003) Use of rifaximin in SUDD was studied in a meta-analysis, which found that 64% of patients treated with rifaximin plus fibre were symptom-free at 1-year follow-up compared with 35% of patients treated with fibre alone.​[[34]](#Bianchi2011) The AGA and ASCRS guidelines do not provide any guidance on the use of rifaximin in SUDD and suggest against its use for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis, pending further study.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

#### Probiotics

Probiotics are formulated from gut microorganisms and have potential efficacy in several gastrointestinal illnesses, including IBD, *C. difficile* colitis, infectious diarrhea and IBS. The mechanisms of this effect are poorly understood but may be related to suppression of growth of pathogenic bacteria, improvement of intestinal barrier function, induction of protective cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), or modulation of pain perception.​[[35]](#Elisei2016)

A 2016 systematic review evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in remission of abdominal symptoms and prevention of acute diverticulitis in patients with existing diverticular disease. Eleven studies were included in the review; 3 studies included patients with SUDD, 4 studies included patients with SUDD in remission, and 4 studies contained patients with complicated or acute diverticulitis. Although the authors concluded that the existing studies were not robust enough to draw meaningful conclusions, they noted that the use of probiotics trended toward a positive clinical response on abdominal symptoms or prevention of recurrence in patients with SUDD.​[[36]](#Lahner2016) However, given that many of the symptoms of SUDD resemble or overlap those of IBS, and a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotics are an effective treatment for IBS, it is difficult to evaluate the true effect of probiotics on abdominal symptoms in patients with diverticular disease.​[[37]](#Ford2014) The AGA and ASCRS guidelines recommend against the routine use of probiotics for prevention of diverticulitis recurrence due to low quality of evidence; NICE concludes there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

#### Antibiotics

Antibiotics have been considered the mainstay of treatment for acute diverticulitis for decades, as diverticulitis was thought to be due to obstruction of a diverticulum, leading to microperforation and translocation of bacteria. Acute diverticulitis is now considered an inflammatory process, and the role of antibiotics has been questioned with the evidence showing no clear benefit.

- The 2012 Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis (AVOD) trial randomized 623 patients with CT-verified, acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis to management with or without antibiotics and found no significant differences between groups at 12 months follow-up in time to recovery, duration of hospital stay, complications or recurrences.​[[38]](#Chabok2012) To examine the long-term impact of antibiotic avoidance, 556 patients from this trial were followed for 11 years; no difference was found in complications, recurrences, surgeries for diverticulitis, or rates of colorectal cancer between the patients managed with or without antibiotics.​[[39]](#Isacson2019)
- The 2017 DIABOLO trial randomized 528 patients with CT-verified, primary, acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis to either an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy and found no significant differences between groups at 6 months follow-up in time to recovery, readmission rate, complicated, ongoing or recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection, or mortality.​[[40]](#Daniels2017) A follow-up at 24 months to examine rates of complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection showed no difference between the patients managed with or without antibiotics.​[[41]](#vanDijk2018)
- The AVOD and DIABOLO randomized controlled trials were combined with observational studies in two 2019 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which compared the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticultis with and without antibiotics. Both analyses concluded there was no significant differences between treatment groups in the rates of treatment failure, readmission, need for surgical intervention, recurrence or complications.​[[42]](#Desai2019)​[[43]](#Au2019)
- A 2020 trial compared antibiotic treatment to placebo in patients hospitalized for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in length of hospital stay (primary endpoint), hospital readmission rate, need for surgical intervention or pain score at 24 hours.​[[44]](#Jaung2020)

The AGA, ASCRS and NICE guidelines all suggest selective, rather than routine, use of antibiotics in patients with acute diverticulitis. Antibiotic therapy is appropriate for patients who are systemically unwell (fever, severe left lower quadrant pain, peritonitis on exam, elevated white blood cell count), immunosuppressed or have significant comorbidity.​[[5]](#Peery2021)​[[6]](#NICE2019)​[[14]](#ASCRS2020)

When selected, antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis must cover the usual gastrointestinal flora of gram-negative rods and anaerobes, particularly Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Typically, one of the following regimens is used in patients with normal renal and hepatic function with consideration given to local rates of bacterial resistance:

- Fluoroquinolone and metronidazole
- Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and metronidazole
- Amoxicillin/clavulanate

Outpatient treatment generally consists of oral antibiotics for 7–10 days. Patients are reassessed clinically 2–3 days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy and weekly thereafter until the complete resolution of all symptoms.

#### Ambulatory Care versus Inpatient Management

SUDD, chronic diverticulitis and acute uncomplicated disease can generally be managed in the ambulatory care setting; a study of patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis showed that after receiving a first dose of IV antibiotics in the emergency department, subsequent outpatient and inpatient treatment resulted in similar failure rates and quality of life.​[[45]](#Biondo2014) However, acute uncomplicated disease with evidence of sepsis, microperforation, immunosuppression, high fever, significant leukocytosis, peritonitis, advanced age, significant comorbidities or failed outpatient treatment merits inpatient admission. When CT scan shows evidence of acute complicated diverticulitis (defined by the presence of perforation, abscess, obstruction or fistulization), inpatient treatment is warranted.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Given that diverticular disease most commonly affects older male patients, data regarding optimal management of disease in young female patients is lacking; however, as more patients are delaying childbearing until later in life, the incidence during pregnancy is expected to increase.

- Aminosalicylates are considered low risk in pregnancy or while breastfeeding and have not been shown to pose a teratogenic risk when used at appropriate doses.​[[46]](#DiavCitrin1998)
- Rifaximin use should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.​[[47]](#Schaefer3rd2015)​[[48]](#Briggs11th2017) The safety profile of rifaximin in nonpregnant adults is excellent​[[49]](#Biancone2017) and the systemic absorption is minimal, suggesting low risk to the developing fetus; however, there are no data evaluating use in human pregnancy.​[[48]](#Briggs11th2017) The AGA suggests that rifaximin is compatible with breastfeeding, but data are lacking.
- Probiotics are rarely systemically absorbed and are considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating probiotic use during pregnancy demonstrated no fetal malformations in the probiotic group and no effect on birth weight, gestational age or the incidence of cesarean section.​[[50]](#Dugoua2009)​[[51]](#Elias2011)
- Antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of outpatient diverticulitis include metronidazole, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amoxicillin/clavulanate:
  - Metronidazole has a low teratogenic risk when used during pregnancy but should be avoided while the patient is breastfeeding, as it transfers into breast milk.​[[52]](#Nielsen2014)
  - Fluoroquinolones have been suggested to cause arthropathies in children​[[52]](#Nielsen2014) and alternatives should be considered for pregnant patients. They should also be avoided while the patient is breastfeeding.
  - Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim should be avoided during the first trimester, since trimethoprim may interfere with folate metabolism and increase the risk of neural tube defects; however, it may be used with supplemental folic acid if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. It should be avoided near term as sulfamethoxazole may lead to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.​[[53]](#Matok2009) Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are transferred into breast milk in low concentrations; however, the combination is considered generally compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
  - Amoxicillin/clavulanate crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation but its use in pregnant patients has not resulted in congenital malformations; it is considered safe for use in pregnancy.​[[54]](#Berkovitch2004) An expert review on published data of amoxicillin during pregnancy showed that therapeutic doses do not pose a teratogenic risk.​[[55]](#Friedman1990) Amoxicillin/clavulanate is also compatible with breastfeeding.​[[56]](#Benyamini2005)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Advise a high-fibre diet, regular exercise, weight loss and smoking cessation to all patients with diverticular disease.
- The decision to use 5-ASA derivatives, rifaximin or probiotics in symptomatic treatment of SUDD should be made in conjunction with the patient, acknowledging limited data on their efficacy.
- Use of antibiotics in management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis.
