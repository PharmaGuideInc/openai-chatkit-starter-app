CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women” and “men” as well as “female” and “male” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

### Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Canada and has a major economic impact on individuals, families and the health-care system.​[[1]](#c0120n00024) CVD refers to diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. There are many different types of CVD and they are often interrelated. The most common type of CVD is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which can affect multiple vascular beds, including the heart, brain and the periphery. Examples of clinical disease (i.e., symptomatic disease) include ischemic heart disease (angina and myocardial infarction [MI]), cerebrovascular disease (stroke and transient ischemic attack [TIA]) and peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication and amputation).

ASCVD is thought to be largely preventable through the identification and management of associated risk factors. Primary prevention refers to the implementation of these strategies prior to developing clinically evident disease. Ideally, these strategies should occur at population and individual levels. In order to be effective at the individual level, these strategies need to identify those at risk as early as possible. The general patient-centred approach to primary prevention is to identify patients at risk through routine screening, evaluate risk factors for ASCVD and implement evidence-based treatments to mitigate this risk. In addition to traditional approaches using physicians and nurses, pharmacists can play an important role in each of these steps and have been shown to effectively implement risk factor reduction strategies in CVD.​[[2]](#Martinez-MardonesFFernandez-LlimosF-A7F0B684)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent cardiovascular events, including MI, stroke and amputation
- Prevent mortality
- Minimize adverse effects from drug therapy
- Preserve and improve quality of life

### Investigations

### Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors

Major risk factors for CVD are fairly well defined and consistent worldwide.​[[3]](#YusufSHawkenSOunpuuSEtAl.EffectOfPo-A7F283AC)​[[4]](#MendisS.TheContributionsOfTheFramin-A7F31902) They are traditionally grouped into modifiable and nonmodifiable factors ([Table 1](#table-11024312-A4DBE111)).

**Table 1:** Major Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease​[[5]](#c0120n00028)[[6]](#c0120n00027)[[7]](#c0120n00074)

| Category | Risk Factors |
| --- | --- |
| Modifiable | Diabetes mellitus Unhealthy diet Dyslipidemia Hypertension Lack of physical activity Obesity Tobacco dependence |
| Nonmodifiable | Age (males >45 and females >50) Family history of premature cardiovascular disease (first-degree relative; males <55 and females <65) Male sex |

There are a number of other emerging risk factors that have been shown to increase the risk of CVD. These include, but are not limited to, inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, HIV, chronic kidney disease, sleep duration, socioeconomic determinants, and elements of a person’s obstetrical and gynecological history.​[[5]](#c0120n00028)​[[8]](#St-OngeMPGrandnerMABrownDEtAl.Sleep-E846C698)​[[9]](#AgarwalaAMichosEDSamadZEtAl.TheUseO-E846C97C) Some guidelines will include race or ethnicity as a risk factor. This reflects the data on which the guideline was based but may be criticized. Though there may be some biological bases for increased risk, it may also reflect social, economic or health inequities. Targeting treatment to at-risk groups appropriately, however, may improve patient outcomes.​[[10]](#CanadianInstituteForHealthInformati-D3784B8E)

### Screening

Risk factor identification is typically done through a good medical history and routine screening. While there are a variety of recommendations for screening pertaining to individual risk factors (see [Table 2](#table-11025312-A4DD8192)), a global CV risk assessment should be done every 5 years (more often if risk status changes) in patients who are 40–75 years of age.​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E) Screening for individual risk factors should occur sooner and more frequently in high-risk individuals. Risk factors for ASCVD often cluster and overlap; therefore, a multifaceted approach is usually required with screening and prevention interventions.

**Table 2:** Screening Parameters for Individual Risk Factors​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)

| Risk Factor | Age Group | Screening Parameter | Frequency | High-Risk Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Diabetes mellitus | ≥40 y or high risk | HbA 1c or fasting blood glucose | Every 3 y | Another CV risk factor First-degree relative with type 2 diabetes Member of high-risk population (e.g., African, Arabian, Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous or South Asian descent, low socioeconomic status)​ [a] History of prediabetes (lGT, lFG or HbA 1c 6.0–6.4%) History of gestational diabetes History of delivery of a macrosomic infant Presence of end organ damage associated with diabetes Presence of associated diseases: history of pancreatitis, PCOS, acanthosis nigricans, hyperuricemia/gout, NASH, psychiatric disorder (bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia), HlV infection, obstructive sleep apnea, cystic fibrosis Use of drugs associated with diagnosis of diabetes: glucocorticoids, atypical antipsychotics, statins, highly active antiretroviral therapy, antirejection drugs |
| Dyslipidemia | ≥40 y or high risk | Nonfasting lipid panel Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) Lipoprotein (a) once in a lifetime | Every 5 y | South Asian, Indigenous populations​ [a] Another CV risk factor Abdominal aortic aneurysm Stigmata of dyslipidemia (arcus cornealis xanthelasma or xanthoma) Chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m​ 2 or ACR >3 mg/mmol) Obesity (BMI >30) Inflammatory disease (AS, IBD, PsA, RA, SLE) HIV infection Erectile dysfunction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy |
| Hypertension | ≥18 y | Blood pressure​ [b] | All appropriate visits |  |
| Obesity | ≥18 y | Height, weight, BMI, waist circumference | All appropriate visits |  |
| Tobacco dependence | ≥18 y | Tobacco use status | All appropriate visits |  |

[a] This risk factor reflects the data on which the guideline was based. CPhA is aware that while there may be some biological bases for increased risk, it may also reflect social, economic or health inequities. Targeting treatment to at-risk groups appropriately, however, may improve patient outcomes.

[b] Measurement using electronic (oscillometric) upper arm devices is preferred.

### Risk Assessment Tools

There are many validated tools to assess global CV risk. The [Framingham risk score (FRS) and other CV risk calculators](https://ccs.ca/calculators-and-forms/) are recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS).​[[5]](#c0120n00028) It is recommended that these tools be used to formalize risk assessment as they provide a more individualized assessment, can be used for shared decision-making with patients and have been shown to improve risk factor modification.​[[5]](#c0120n00028)​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)

Using a tool also aids in risk stratification of patients as low, intermediate or high. These definitions may be different depending on the tool used or guideline followed. The preferred FRS model provides a risk prediction over 10 years (see [Table 3](#table-11026123-A7F564B7)). Instructions for calculating an FRS can be found in Dyslipidemias, Figure 1.

Risk stratification allows health-care practitioners to match the intensity of the preventative intervention with the individual’s absolute risk, maximizing benefit and minimizing harm. Absolute risk reductions are smaller in primary prevention compared with secondary prevention because baseline risk is lower. Selecting patients with the highest chance of benefit is key when considering pharmacotherapy.

**Table 3:** Risk Stratification Using the 10-Year Framingham Risk Score

| Framingham Risk Score (%)​[a] | Risk Stratification |
| --- | --- |
| ≤10 | Low |
| 11–19 | Intermediate |
| ≥20 | High |

[a] The Framingham risk score provides an estimate of the chance of experiencing a vascular event (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure) in the next 10 years.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Healthy behaviours, either separately or combined, can reduce cardiovascular risk.​[[12]](#c0120n00077)​[[13]](#c0120n00078) A multifaceted approach to healthy behaviour modification may be required, including cognitive and behavioural therapies, individual and group-based strategies, and consideration of cultural and social context variables that may influence behavioural change.​[[14]](#c0120n00087)

### Diet

In order to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, individuals should be encouraged to moderate caloric intake. There are several healthy dietary patterns that can be recommended that lower CVD risk:​[[5]](#c0120n00028)​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)

- [Mediterranean dietary pattern](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801)
- [Portfolio dietary pattern](https://ccs.ca/app/uploads/2020/11/Portfolio_Diet_Scroll_editable_eng.pdf)
- [DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) dietary pattern](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan)
- [Low glycemic load or low GI dietary pattern](https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/GuideLines/media/Docs/Patient Resources/glycemic-index-food-guide.pdf)
- Plant-based dietary patterns
- Dietary patterns high in:

  - nuts (≥30 g/day)
  - legumes (≥4 servings/week)
  - olive oil (≥60 mL/day)
  - fruits and vegetables (≥5 servings/day)
  - total fibre (≥30 g/day and whole grains [≥3 serving/day])

See also Special Diets

The Mediterranean diet is the only diet that has been shown to reduce the composite endpoint of MI, stroke and death from cardiovascular causes by approximately 30% or 3 major cardiovascular events per 1000 patient-years.​[[15]](#c0120n00089)

### Sodium

Reducing dietary sodium can reduce BP. It is recommended to consider reducing sodium intake towards 2 g per day (5 g salt or 87 mmol sodium).​[[6]](#c0120n00027)​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E) For example, in a trial using the DASH diet in patients with hypertension, participants achieved a BP 11.2/7.5 mm Hg lower than those in the control diet group.​[[12]](#c0120n00077)​[[16]](#c0120n00033)

### Potassium

It is recommended by Hypertension Canada to increase daily potassium consumption, as it has been shown to improve BP control. The preference is to focus on dietary interventions, such as those in the DASH diet (e.g., fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes). Caution should be used in patient populations that may be at risk of hyperkalemia, such as those with chronic kidney disease (eGFR <45 mL/min/m​2), heart failure, those on potassium-sparing drugs (e.g., spironolactone, ACE inhibitors, ARBs) and/or those with high baseline levels of potassium (K​+ >4.5 mmol/L).​[[17]](#HypertensionCanada.OrganizationalPo-D92448DD)

### Physical Activity

It is recommended that adults 18–64 years of age participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous aerobic physical activity per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more (e.g., running, cycling). Additionally, adding muscle- and bone-strengthening activities using major muscle groups twice weekly is also beneficial (e.g., lifting weights).​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)​[[19]](#WarburtonDNicolCBredinS.HealthBenef-95800C62) This amount of physical activity may reduce relative cardiovascular risk by 30–50%.

### Body Habitus

Obesity is associated with vascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus.​[[5]](#c0120n00028)​[[6]](#c0120n00027)​[[20]](#c0120n00031) Patients should be encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight (BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m​2). Additionally, a waist circumference of <102 cm for men or <88 cm for women is recommended.​[[6]](#c0120n00027)​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E) A comprehensive healthy lifestyle intervention, including a dietary plan, should be offered to patients who are overweight or obese.​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)​[[21]](#LauDCWDouketisJDMorrisonKMEtAl.2006-5072DA53) Bariatric surgery may be considered with class III overweight/obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m​2) or class II overweight/obesity (BMI 35–39.9 kg/m​2) with other comorbidities.​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E)​[[21]](#LauDCWDouketisJDMorrisonKMEtAl.2006-5072DA53)

### Alcohol

Limiting alcohol intake reduces BP.​[[6]](#c0120n00027)​[[11]](#TobeSWStoneJAAndersonTEtAl.Canadian-A7F49A7E) Recommended alcohol intake is a maximum of ≤2 standard drinks per day or ≤14 standard drinks per week for men and ≤9 standard drinks per week for women. One standard drink contains 13.6 g alcohol (e.g., 45 mL spirits, 150 mL table wine, 360 mL beer). Further noncardiovascular health benefits may be obtained by reducing alcohol intake to ≤2 drinks per week.​[[18]](#ParadisCButtPShieldKEtAl.Canadax201-D3061E29)

### Smoking

Patients should be encouraged to stop using tobacco and minimize exposure to secondhand smoke.​[[22]](#c0120n00037) Nonpharmacologic therapies may include behaviour support. Behaviour support, in person or via telephone, may increase the chances of quitting by 10–20%.​[[23]](#Hartmannx2010Boycexa0xa0JHongxa0xa0-A9F1C80C)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Absolute risk reductions (ARRs) for primary preventive pharmacological strategies are smaller compared with secondary preventive strategies, as patients are typically at lower risk and therefore have less to gain in terms of benefit. However, there still is a spectrum of risk in primary prevention, and efforts should focus on identifying those at highest risk and most likely to benefit from intervention. Furthermore, as the chance of benefit increases, the balance of risk (e.g., adverse effects) versus benefit may favour treatment. Regardless, patients should be engaged in these discussions regarding risk and benefit in order to make informed decisions and impact long-term adherence to therapy. While healthy behaviour modification is always the first step and backbone of preventative strategies, pharmacotherapy has a role in those at highest risk.

[Table 4](#table-1113231-AB0333D9) summarizes the ARR and numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vascular events with the pharmacologic therapies discussed below.

**Table 4:**  Primary Prevention Pharmacotherapy and Associated Cardiovascular Outcomes

| Intervention | Outcome | ARR/NNT​[a] | Time Frame | Potential Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Antihypertensive therapy​ [24] | MACE | NA | 4–5 y | Symptoms from hypotension. Side effects from individual antihypertensives. |
| MI | 0.7%/143 |
| Stroke | 1.3%/77 |
| Statin therapy​ [25] | MACE | 1.39%/52 | 2–5 y | Meta-analysis showed no difference in side effects (e.g., myalgias, diabetes, rhabdomyolysis) between statins. Most common side effect is myalgia.​ [26] |
| MI | 0.81%/123 |
| Stroke | 0.38%/263 |
| ASA​ [27] | MACE | 0.41%/241 | 5 y | Major bleeding: ARI 0.47%, NNH 210 . Most commonly GI bleeding. |
| MI | 0.28%/361 |
| Stroke—nonischemic | NS 0.19% |

### Hypertension

Lowering BP with antihypertensive therapy reduces the relative risk of a first major vascular event by ~20–40% when compared with placebo.​[[28]](#c0120n00038)​[[29]](#c0120n00039) Larger reductions in BP produce larger reductions in risk,​[[30]](#c0120n00079) and the higher the baseline BP, the greater the potential benefits of reduction.​[[31]](#c0120n00040) The strength of evidence related to systolic or diastolic BP reduction varies. However, it is generally accepted that both are important predictors of CV events. Pharmacotherapy for hypertension is recommended for adults with BP ≥140/90 mm Hg as well as for adults with systolic BP 130–139 mm Hg at high CV risk.​[[32]](#GoupilRTsuyukiRTSantessoNEtAl.Hyper-CE47C221) High CV risk is defined as established CVD, diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2), chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m​2 or albuminuria ≥3 mg/mmol), 10-year FRS ≥20% or age ≥75 years.

See Hypertension for current recommendations on the choice of antihypertensive agents.

### Dyslipidemia

The only lipid-lowering agents that have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in primary prevention are **HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors** (statins). When compared to placebo, statins reduce the relative risk of a first major vascular event by ~15–30% (see [Table 4](#table-1113231-AB0333D9)).​[[25]](#c0120n00042)​[[33]](#c0120n00041)​[[34]](#c0120n00043)​[[35]](#c0120n00080) Statins provided similar relative risk reductions in primary and secondary prevention trials; however, they have smaller ARRs in primary prevention, resulting in a larger NNT.​[[25]](#c0120n00042)​[[33]](#c0120n00041)​[[34]](#c0120n00043)​[[35]](#c0120n00080) The overall goal of therapy with statins is to reduce CV events. However, practically speaking, this goal is achieved via a reduction of LDL-C (or non-HDL-C or Apo B), with the specific target number based on individual patient risk (see Dyslipidemias, Figure 2).

Current guidelines recommend patients at low cardiovascular risk should focus on health behavioural modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) and not receive statin pharmacotherapy routinely.​[[5]](#c0120n00028) Those at high risk are candidates for treatment with statin therapy. Those in the intermediate risk category can be considered for statin therapy based on whether they meet inclusion criteria from primary prevention studies (e.g., LDL-C ≥3.5 mmol/L, non-HDL-C >4.2 mmol/L or Apo B >1.05 g/L; older individuals with an additional risk factor) and patient preference. The “treat-to-target” approach (adjusting statin therapy to achieve a target LDL-C) remains controversial in primary prevention, as data for aggressive LDL-C lowering are drawn primarily from secondary prevention literature. Canadian guidelines advocate for a treatment threshold rather than a target, and recommend intensifying therapy until below the threshold. Suggested treatment thresholds include LDL-C >2 mmol/L, non-HDL-C >2.6 or Apo B >0.8mg/L.​[[5]](#c0120n00028)

See Dyslipidemias for current recommendations on the choice of antihyperlipidemic agents.

### Diabetes Mellitus

Patients with diabetes are automatically considered to be at high cardiovascular risk, as diabetes itself accelerates the development of CV disease. Cardiovascular disease is the most common complication of diabetes. A global cardiovascular risk reduction strategy addressing all risk factors should be initiated in all patients (see Diabetes Mellitus - Chronic Complications).​[[20]](#c0120n00031)

##### Glycemic Control

While reducing blood glucose or HbA1c has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications (e.g., retinopathy or nephropathy),​[[36]](#c0120n00044)​[[37]](#c0120n00092) the evidence linking tight glycemic control to prevention of macrovascular complications is less robust, particularly in type 2 diabetes.​[[38]](#c0120n00045)​[[39]](#c0120n00081)​[[40]](#c0120n00082) Some **glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonists**​[[41]](#MarsoSPDanielsGHBrown-FrandsenKEtAl-A9FC11CD)​[[42]](#MarsoSPBainSCConsoliAEtAl.Semagluti-A9FC154F) and **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors**​[[43]](#ZinmanBWannerCLachinJMEtAl.Empaglif-A9FB597C)​[[44]](#NealBPerkovicVMahaffeyKWEtAl.Canagl-A9FB5767)​[[45]](#PerkovicVJardineMJNealBEtAl.Canagli-A9FB549D) have been shown to decrease CV events in those with CV disease and multiple risk factors for CV disease and should be considered in high-risk patients with diabetes.

See Diabetes Mellitus for current recommendations on the choice of antihyperglycemic agents.

### Antiplatelets

The role of antiplatelet therapy in primary prevention of vascular disease is controversial and as a result, guidelines have mixed recommendations.​[[7]](#c0120n00074)​[[20]](#c0120n00031)​[[46]](#Bibbins-DomingoKU.S.PreventiveServi-AB76489A)​[[47]](#BellADRoussinACartierREtAl.TheUseOf-AA0083AC)

Three randomized controlled trials have attempted to address the use of ASA for primary prevention in contemporary practice.​[[48]](#McNeilJJWolfeRWoodsRLEtAl.EffectOfA-AA032120)​[[49]](#McNeilJJNelsonMRWoodsRLEtAl.EffectO-AA0323FB)​[[50]](#TheASCENDStudyCollaborativeGroup.Ef-AA0326DF)​[[51]](#GazianoJMBrotonsCCoppolecchiaREtAl.-AA032950) A meta-analysis of 13 trials, including these 3 trials, identified a small decrease in cardiovascular events (CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke) resulting in an ARR 0.41% and NNT 241.​[[27]](#ZhengSLRoddickAJ.AssociationOfAspir-AA043A7F) This small benefit was balanced by an absolute risk increase (ARI) in major bleeding of 0.47%, number needed to harm (NNH) 210. Essentially, the risks and benefits were found to be similar.

This information can be used in shared decision-making with patients to make individual treatment decisions. The use of low-dose ASA for primary prevention is not routinely recommended by most guidelines.​[[7]](#c0120n00074)​[[20]](#c0120n00031)​[[47]](#BellADRoussinACartierREtAl.TheUseOf-AA0083AC) However, it can be considered in those 40–70 years of age at high risk of CV disease who are not at increased risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding may include:​[[7]](#c0120n00074)

- History of GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease
- Bleeding from other sites
- Age >70 years
- Thrombocytopenia
- Coagulopathy
- Chronic kidney disease
- Concurrent use of NSAID, COX-2 inhibitor, steroid or anticoagulant
- Uncontrolled hypertension

Given the recent evidence, changing guidelines and the fact that ASA is available for self-selection, practitioners may encounter situations in which patients have been on ASA for some time and now the indication for treatment is being reassessed. A discussion regarding the risks and benefits of treatment should guide continued use of therapy. The decision aid included in the [CCS guidelines](https://onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(23)01841-X/fulltext#appsec1) on antiplatelet therapy may be helpful. Additionally, those patients who continue on ASA for primary prevention should have their risk factors for bleeding evaluated regularly to ensure that risks do not exceed benefits.

### Smoking Cessation

Observational studies suggest that the elevated vascular risk induced by cigarette smoking can be decreased by quitting and reversed after 5 years of abstinence.​[[52]](#c0120n00052) The success of a quit attempt can be enhanced by the use of a cessation aid.​[[53]](#c0120n00053) Options available include nicotine **replacement therapy** **(NRT)** (gum, patch, inhalers, lozenges), bupropion and varenicline. Nonpharmacologic interventions, in combination with pharmacologic therapies, are effective in optimizing success rates and may be superior to pharmacologic therapies alone.​[[54]](#c0120n00054)​[[55]](#SteadLFKoilpillaiPFanshaweTREtAl.Co-5072938A)

While widely promoted as a cessation aide, e-cigarettes are not recommended for smoking cessation due to a lack of evidence supporting their efficacy and long-term safety.​[[56]](#KalkhoranSGlantzSA.E-cigarettesAndS-50723FAD)​[[57]](#MalasMVanDerTempelJSchwartzREtAl.El-507272D4) In fact, there have been reports of deaths and subsequent warnings related to pulmonary illness associated with vaping products.​[[58]](#HeathCanada.InformationUpdatex2013H-AA6D6C2D)

See Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation for current recommendations on the choice of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies.

### Obesity

Pharmacotherapy can be considered in those who are not able to attain or maintain clinically important weight loss with medical nutrition and exercise therapy. The goal is to reduce obesity-related complications.​[[21]](#LauDCWDouketisJDMorrisonKMEtAl.2006-5072DA53) There are several prescription agents in Canada with a weight loss indication: orlistat, liraglutide, semaglutide and a product combining naltrexone and bupropion.​[[59]](#PatelD.PharmacotherapyForManagement-AA6F1829) Tirzepatide has also been associated with significant weight loss.

Medications should be used to support medical nutrition therapy, physical activity and psychological interventions, as discontinuation of these agents typically leads to weight regain. Drug therapy should be regarded as a therapeutic trial and stopped if significant weight loss is not achieved after several months unless there are other compelling indications such as type 2 diabetes for liraglutide or semaglutide.​[[21]](#LauDCWDouketisJDMorrisonKMEtAl.2006-5072DA53)​[[60]](#c0120n00057) The efficacy of these agents is based on weight loss parameters (absolute, maintenance, etc.) rather than cardiovascular outcomes. Semaglutide, both oral and subcutaneous formulations, is currently the only agent that has been shown to impact CV outcomes, but not in primary prevention.​[[61]](#LincoffAMBrown-FrandsenKColhounHMEt-D30B4F0E)​[[62]](#McGuireDKMarxNMulvaghSLEtAl.OralSem-CE4DA04A)

See Obesity for current recommendations on the choice of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies.

### Nutritional Supplements

There is no conclusive evidence that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reduces vascular risk in primary prevention,​[[63]](#c0120n00058) and no definitive statements can be made regarding a potential protective effect of omega-6 fatty acids​[[64]](#c0120n00059) (see [Table 5](#table-11239321-F3151FED)). Antioxidant supplements such as selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E have not been shown to provide vascular risk reduction in those with or without established vascular disease and in some cases have shown evidence of harm.​[[65]](#c0120n00060)​[[66]](#c0120n00061)​[[67]](#c0120n00091) Similarly, homocysteine-lowering vitamins (B6, folic acid and B12) have not consistently shown any vascular risk reduction.​[[69]](#c0120n00062)​[[70]](#c0120n00084) Primary prevention of vascular events or mortality has not been demonstrated with **multivitamin tablets** or vitamin D.​[[68]](#SessoHDChristenWGBubesVEtAl.Multivi-5072F97E)​[[71]](#c0120n00085)​[[72]](#c0120n00086)​[[73]](#MansonJECookNRLeeIEtAl.VitaminDSupp-AA7C4FBA) For general good health, dietary recommendations include eating a variety of foods to provide a balanced source of vitamins and other nutrients.​[[74]](#c0120n00034)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Every patient encounter is an opportunity to identify risk factors for ASCVD, discuss risk factor modification and encourage patient progress.
- Nonpharmacologic management is the cornerstone of CV risk-reduction strategies. Utilize motivational interviewing to engage patients and consider developing SMART (**s**pecific, **m**easurable, **a**chievable, **r**ealistic, **t**imely) goals to help patients achieve their desired outcomes (see Facilitating Behaviour Change).
- Shared decision-making should be employed when considering pharmacotherapy, given the lower absolute benefits in primary prevention:
  - Patients suitable for primary prevention have not yet experienced symptoms of disease and therefore may not wish to begin drug therapy and more intensive monitoring.
  - Discussions should include an outline of benefits (reducing CV events) and risks (adverse effects, costs) of treatment. Stress the importance of risk factor reduction to prevent MI and stroke, not simply to reduce surrogate markers (e.g., cholesterol, BP).
  - A reminder to patients that long-term adherence to drug therapy will be required to realize benefits of therapy is also important.
  - There are a number of shared decision-making tools available for clinical practice, e.g.:
