CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.​[[1]](#PMID11176917) Around 2.2 million Canadians >40 years of age have diagnosed osteoporosis, and 130 000 fractures occur in 1 year, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.​[[2]](#StatsCanada) Osteoporosis thus remains an important public health challenge in Canada.

Bone is constantly remodelling, with older, weaker bone being removed by osteoclasts (resorption), which is then followed by osteocyte/osteoblast-mediated new bone formation. This coupling of bone resorption and new bone formation is fundamental to normal bone physiology. If there is a failure of the coupling process such that bone formation does not replace the resorption, an imbalance in remodeling occurs, resulting in net bone loss and the development of osteoporosis.​[[3]](#Delaisse2020) Normal age-related bone loss might be regarded as a milder version of the same process: as bone remodeling continues, there is a mild remodelling imbalance resulting in a net loss of a small amount of bone mass per year. There is an acceleration of remodelling and bone loss that occurs with menopause; this is thought to be a major contributor to the increased risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients.​[[4]](#Young1996)​[[5]](#Rosen1997)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent fractures, disability and loss of independence
- Preserve or enhance bone mass

### Investigations

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines identify key predictors of osteoporosis-related fracture:​[[6]](#c0061n00018)

- History:

  - Measured height loss of >6 cm of recalled peak height as a young adult or >2 cm height loss within past year.
  - History of falling.
  - Chronic or acute back pain.
  - Previous fractures.
  - Conditions and medications associated with increased risk of fractures (see [Table 1](#c0061n00017)).
- Physical examination:

  - Kyphosis: <3 fingers' breadth between rib and pelvis.
  - Factors increasing risk of falling: muscle weakness (inability to rise from a chair), impaired visual acuity, poor balance or disability causing a tendency to fall.
- Laboratory investigations:

  - All should be normal: CBC, calcium, alkaline phosphatase (may be elevated in acute recovery from fracture), creatinine. Measure TSH if there is a clinical suspicion of thyroid disease. Serum protein electrophoresis if there is a suspicion of secondary causes of osteoporosis. Serum 25-OH vitamin D if the patient is at increased risk of deficiency (e.g., malabsorption syndromes, housebound, established osteoporosis requiring pharmacologic therapy). Measure after patient has been taking vitamin D supplements for 3 months.
  - Markers of bone turnover are not appropriate for diagnosis or routine management.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)
- Diagnostic imaging:

  - X-rays are mainly used for detecting fractures.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) If x-ray shows evidence of osteopenia (decreased bone mineral density), confirm with a BMD measurement.
  - Bone scans can identify new fracture activity in patients with back pain and no obvious new fracture on x-ray.
- BMD measurements and fracture risk stratification:

  - A hip or vertebral fracture occurring after menopause or age 50 should place a patient in a high-risk category irrespective of BMD, unless the fracture occurred due to a high-trauma accident (e.g., car accident, falling down 3 or more steps).
  - BMD of the spine and hip by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the preferred method of assessing bone mass. The BMD is mainly used for establishing a patient’s risk of fracture and can be used for monitoring response to therapy.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) Other methods (e.g., heel ultrasound) are acceptable for assessing fracture risk if DXA is not available.​[[7]](#c0061n00019)
  - Bone strength is an integration of bone mineral content (usually BMD measured by DXA) and bone “quality” (reflecting microarchitectural structure). A WHO study group developed a DXA-BMD definition of osteoporosis as a BMD T-score ≤−2.5 (2.5 standard deviations below a normal young adult reference mean). DXA-measured BMD reflects quantity of bone mineral, a significant component of bone strength, but does not reflect other determinants of bone strength such as non-mineral material or structural properties of bone that contribute to “bone quality.”
  - Clinical history of fragility fractures previously had been the only available indicator of bone quality. However, trabecular bone score (TBS), a measurement derived from texture analysis of DXA images of the lumbar vertebral bodies, can provide an index of bone quality. Calculating TBS from routine DXA measurements of BMD requires additional software, but many BMD facilities are now providing TBS measurements. Compared with routine DXA analysis, TBS provides additional information and can improve fracture risk prediction.​[[8]](#Leslie2020) High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) provides 3-dimensional imaging of microarchitecture of bone and allows finite element analysis (FEA) estimation of bone strength.​[[9]](#Cheung2013) Although currently available only as a research tool, HR-pQCT assessment of bone microarchitecture of the distal radius or tibia has been shown to be a strong, independent predictor of fracture risk.​[[10]](#Samelson2019)
  - The clinical focus in osteoporosis diagnosis and management has shifted from reliance on a BMD definition of osteoporosis to using BMD as a component of assessment of risk of fragility fracture. In making clinical decisions regarding osteoporosis prevention and treatment, the finding of a low BMD should be considered in the context of other risk factors; fracture risk calculators combining BMD with other fracture risk factors are available. Most clinical practice guidelines utilize these calculators to characterize 10-year fracture risk as low (<10%), moderate (10–20%) or high (>20%).​[[6]](#c0061n00018)​[[11]](#Shoback2020) Osteoporosis Canada guidelines recommend a discussion of therapeutic choices with all patients at moderate risk and a therapeutic intervention in patients at high risk of fracture.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)
  - Treatment decisions are based on a patient's overall risk of a fracture, derived by combining age and epidemiologic data with DXA-BMD measurements. Two Canadian fracture risk calculators have been validated as an aid to osteoporosis management for the Canadian population:
    - [FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool)](http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/)​[[12]](#c0061n00193) is a country-specific fracture risk calculator introduced by the WHO Collaborative Group. FRAX uses a single femoral neck BMD measurement (or body mass index if BMD is unavailable) and validated risk factors to calculate a 10-year percentage risk of major osteoporotic fracture (forearm, humerus, spine, hip) for patients ≥40 years of age (see [Figure 1](#FraxExample)).
    - CAROC (Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada) risk assessment tool uses femoral neck BMD (see [Figure 2](#c0061n11111)). In CAROC, corticosteroid therapy or a fragility fracture at a site other than hip or spine moves a patient to a higher-risk category than that indicated by BMD and age. Two such fractures or fracture plus corticosteroid therapy places a patient in a high-risk category. Most Canadian DXA centres have been using CAROC in reporting BMD, although FRAX is now incorporated in most DXA software. Additionally, FRAX has been shown to be slightly superior to CAROC as a predictor of fracture risk.​[[13]](#Leslie2016)

    The [Garvan (Australian) fracture risk calculator](https://www.garvan.org.au/promotions/bone-fracture-risk/calculator/), derived from the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, has also been validated in a Canadian population.​[[14]](#Langsetmo2011)

| --- | --- |
| Age ≥65 y Conditions associated with increased risk of fracture in men 50–64 y of age and postmenopausal women: parent with hip fracture osteopenia identified on x-ray current smoking high alcohol intake low body weight ( <60 kg ) or major weight loss (>10% of weight since age 25) Any age: History of fragility fracture (fracture occurring with low trauma e.g., fall from standing height or less) Hypogonadism or premature menopause (<45 y) Hyperthyroidism Cushing syndrome Hyperparathyroidism Renal diseases Organ transplantation GI diseases: gastric surgery, bariatric surgery, malabsorption syndrome Other disorders strongly associated with rapid bone loss or fracture (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myelomas) | Androgen deprivation therapy Anticoagulants (unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins, warfarin) Antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid and enzyme inducers) Antiretroviral therapy Aromatase inhibitors Chemotherapy Corticosteroids, prolonged use​ [b] Cyclosporine Loop diuretics Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Thiazolidinediones Vitamin A, high dose Drugs associated with increased risk of falls in the elderly (e.g., antipsychotics, sedatives) |

Note The examples above highlight the parameters included in the FRAX algorithm. Note the significant change in the 10-year probability of fracture between example 1 and example 2. The addition of 1 risk factor (previous fracture) changes the patient's risk estimate from low to moderately high, which should warrant a discussion of pharmacologic therapy. The presence of 1 more risk factor would place the patient in a high-risk category.

### Therapeutic Choices

Osteoporosis therapy may be subdivided into *prevention* and *treatment* of established osteoporosis (see ). Patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy require special attention for the prevention of osteoporosis.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Recommended for everyone:

- Regular exercise: a combination of weight-bearing aerobic activities, strength training, flexibility and balance exercises is ideal.​[[15]](#LaMonte2019)​[[16]](#Watson2018)
- Fall prevention: minimize hazards for falling in the home (e.g., remove throw rugs, install grab bars in bathrooms, ensure adequate lighting), assess drugs implicated in falls such as benzodiazepines and other psychotropics.
- Smoking cessation.
- Dietary measures: encourage adequate protein, calcium and vitamin D intake, as dietary deficiencies of these nutrients are clearly associated with abnormal bone structure and increased fracture risk. Avoid excessive alcohol (>2 drinks/day) and caffeine (>4 cups of coffee per day or equivalent). A full review of dietary and exercise effects on bone is beyond the scope of this chapter.

### Pharmacologic Choices

The last 20 years have seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the regulation of skeletal growth and bone turnover, and new bone-modifying therapies of osteoporosis have been developed as a result of these discoveries.​[[17]](#Baron2018)​[[18]](#Boyle2003) Pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis (see [Table 3](#c0061n00044)) manipulate the normal processes involved in bone remodelling, either by reducing bone remodelling (these drugs are usually termed antiresorptive agents) or stimulating bone formation (anabolic agents).​[[19]](#c0061n00021)

### Nutritional Supplements

In all age groups, assuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake appears to have a modest effect in preserving or enhancing bone mass.​[[20]](#c0061n00248) Calcium and vitamin D supplementation has been shown, in a randomized clinical trial (RCT), to prevent fractures in healthy, ambulatory postmenopausal women living in nursing homes or apartment houses for elderly people,​[[21]](#c0061n00039) and meta-analysis supports this finding in all sexes.​[[22]](#c0061n00268) However, clinical trials showing fracture prevention and significant improvement in BMD featured populations that were either vitamin D–deficient or were at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. More recent meta-analyses suggest a lack of significant fracture prevention or BMD benefit for vitamin D or calcium supplement use in a healthy population.​[[23]](#Kahwati2018)

- Although calcium supplementation has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events,​[[24]](#c0061n00258)​[[25]](#c0061n00259) recent data refute this finding.​[[26]](#c0061n00260)​[[27]](#c0061n00261) Encourage fulfillment of calcium needs first through dietary intake, then by adding supplements when appropriate.
- Vitamin D insufficiency is a common problem in Canada;​[[28]](#c0061n00121) in patients with osteoporosis, the presence of vitamin D deficiency makes the problem worse. The average Canadian does not meet all vitamin D needs through diet; to be certain the patient has adequate vitamin D, Osteoporosis Canada recommends 800–2000 units of vitamin D per day for individuals who are >50 years of age and at risk for osteoporosis.​[[29]](#c0061n00262) There is no evidence of skeletal benefit for increasing doses of vitamin D above these levels, and a recent RCT raises the possibility of enhanced bone loss when vitamin D–sufficient subjects are given daily doses ≥4000 units per day.​[[30]](#Burt2019)

### Antiremodelling (or Antiresorptive) Agents

*Antiremodelling* may be a more accurate descriptive term than antiresorptive because the so-called antiresorptive drugs do more than suppress osteoclast activity. The net effect is a reduction in resorption and bone formation, but also a correction of the remodelling imbalance, with prevention of bone loss and a slight gain in BMD. Most drugs approved for osteoporosis are antiremodelling. By acting to reduce both the depth and rate of bone resorption while bone formation proceeds normally, these agents cause an initial increase in bone mass. This increase eventually plateaus, as bone formation slows to match the reduced rate of resorption.​[[19]](#c0061n00021)

### Bisphosphonates

Bisphosphonates (e.g., oral alendronate, risedronate and IV zoledronate) are the mainstay of osteoporosis treatment. The large clinical trials of alendronate, risedronate and zoledronate show a consistent reduction in relative risk of osteoporotic fracture in the range of 40–60%.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) The drugs are, for the most part, very well tolerated.

When given orally or parenterally, bisphosphonates bind to bone mineral, and when osteoclasts begin the bone-resorption process, they secrete acid to dissolve bone mineral. This creates an acidic environment allowing the bisphosphonate to cross the cell membrane and enter the osteoclast, inhibiting osteoclast activity. All bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity and cause osteoclast apoptosis. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, inhibit an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway important for intracellular signalling, while the non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (etidronate, clodronate) are incorporated into non-hydrolyzable methylene analogues of ATP; their intracellular accumulation in osteoclasts results in apoptosis.​[[31]](#Russell2008)

Alendronate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton and reduces the risk of all fractures (including hip).​[[32]](#c0061n00025)​[[33]](#c0061n00027)​[[34]](#c0061n00026) Although an observational study noted decreased efficacy of alendronate with concurrent use of PPIs,​[[35]](#c0061n00226) this may have been due to the association of PPIs with fractures rather than a drug interaction with alendronate.

Risedronate, like alendronate, is associated with a reduced risk of all osteoporosis-associated fractures.​[[36]](#c0061n00028)​[[37]](#c0061n00029)

Etidronate was the first bisphosphonate to be used in clinical medicine. Cyclical etidronate increases bone density and is effective for secondary prevention of vertebral fractures, but evidence for fracture prevention is much less robust than for the other bisphosphonates, with no clinical trials demonstrating prevention of nonvertebral fractures.​[[38]](#c0061n00221) Etidronate is no longer available in Canada.

Gains in spinal bone density appear to be greater with alendronate and risedronate than with etidronate, and a meta-analysis places these agents ahead of etidronate in preventing both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.​[[39]](#c0061n00030) Guidelines recognize alendronate and risedronate as first-line therapies for osteoporosis.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)

No well-designed, direct comparative trials of bisphosphonates have been sufficiently powered to identify whether one of them has superior fracture prevention. A randomized trial showed alendronate had a greater effect on BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover than risedronate, but fracture prevention was not different.​[[40]](#c0061n00110) Conversely, an observational study suggests earlier and greater fracture prevention with risedronate than with alendronate.​[[41]](#c0061n00111)

All oral bisphosphonates have very poor intestinal absorption, e.g., alendronate <1%. They must be taken on an empty stomach and with water only, as other medications or food will prevent absorption. Strict adherence to dosing instructions is mandatory. The main side effects of bisphosphonates are minor GI upset and allergic reactions; serious adverse effects are rare (see [Risks of Bisphosphonate Therapy](#c0061n00222)).

Intravenous bisphosphonates have been reserved for patients who cannot tolerate the GI side effects of oral agents, when they cannot adhere to dosing instructions or when it appears a patient is not responding to an oral agent. Adherence to therapy is a major problem with oral bisphosphonates, and review of large clinical databases suggests that when adherence falls below 80%, the fracture prevention benefit begins to disappear.​[[42]](#refitem-1172131-C759113D) Adherence is less of an issue with IV dosing, particularly with once-yearly zoledronate. A large, three-year randomized controlled trial of once-yearly IV **zoledronate (**zoledronic acid**)** 5 mg or placebo IV infusion in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis showed a reduction in the incidence of all osteoporotic fractures, including hip fractures in the zoledronic acid group.​[[43]](#c0061n00115) In patients with prior hip fractures, once-yearly IV zoledronate has also been associated with a reduction in the incidence of subsequent fractures and a 28% relative reduction in all-cause mortality.​[[44]](#c0061n00183) In a small RCT in men with osteoporosis, zoledronate once-yearly IV reduced the incidence of subsequent vertebral fractures.​[[45]](#c0061n00244)

The optimal dose and frequency of IV zoledronate therapy merits further study. A small, open-label extension of a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT found a single IV dose of zoledronate prevented bone density loss and suppressed markers of bone turnover for 2–3 years in patients receiving 1 mg, for 3–4 years in patients receiving 2.5 mg and for 5 years in patients receiving 5 mg, suggesting that a 5-mg dose could be given less frequently than once-yearly, particularly after initial once-yearly therapy (see [Bisphosphonate Drug Holidays](#c0061n00245)).​[[46]](#refitem-1142135-29BC30A3) A 6–year randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial of IV zoledronate 5 mg every 18 months in older postmenopausal women (mean age 71 y) with low BMD demonstrated a significant reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.​[[47]](#Reid2018)

IV zoledronate joins oral alendronate and risedronate as a recommended first-line therapy for osteoporosis, and a recent meta-analysis ranks it slightly ahead of oral bisphosphonates.​[[48]](#refitem-1172137-C759DF4C)

### Risks of Bisphosphonate Therapy

It should be emphasized that there is no evidence that bisphosphonates interfere with the process of fracture healing.​[[49]](#refitem-1172144-B33B90F3)​[[50]](#refitem-1172145-B33C04A7) However, in 2005, case reports began to appear describing “atypical” femoral fractures (AFF) with some similarity to stress fractures, usually occurring as a spontaneous fracture in the subtrochanteric region of the femur in patients treated for ≥2 years with bisphosphonates (mainly alendronate).​[[51]](#c0061n00198) Two series of case reports have described bone biopsies showing very low bone turnover but the pathogenesis of these atypical fractures remains unclear.​[[51]](#c0061n00198)​[[52]](#c0061n00196) Subtrochanteric osteoporotic fractures were also seen before bisphosphonates were available, and 1 large cohort study suggested many are not different from osteoporotic fractures.​[[53]](#c0061n00199) The association between bisphosphonate use and AFFs may be influenced by the fact that these drugs are used for the treatment of osteoporosis (confounding by indication). Although the mechanism whereby bisphosphonates might cause these fractures remains to be determined, there is a consensus that the association of AFFs with bisphosphonate therapy is indeed related to causation;​[[54]](#c0061n00255) 30–90% of all AFFs occur in bisphosphonate users.​[[55]](#c0061n00240)

Bisphosphonates use for 2–4 years was associated with 11 AFFs per 100 000 patients per year, and the risk of AFF increased with longer duration of use.​[[56]](#c0061n00241) In contrast, the incidence of “typical” hip fracture is 750–4200 per 100 000 high-risk patients per year. Similar findings were observed in a cohort study of women ≥50 years of age enrolled in the Southern California Kaiser Permanente database.​[[57]](#Black2020) After 3 years of bisphosphonates therapy, the risk of AFF associated with bisphosphonate therapy appears to far outweigh the number of hip and clinical fractures prevented in high-risk patients. As shown in previous studies, the risk of AFF was also found to increase with longer duration of use and, interestingly, rapidly decrease following cessation of bisphosphonates therapy.​[[57]](#Black2020)

### Atypical Femur Fracture Risk Management

- Educate patients at high risk of fractures about the risks of AFFs compared to the risk of no treatment.
- Encourage patients who are not at high risk of osteoporotic fractures to stop bisphosphonates after 5 years of therapy (see [Bisphosphonate Drug Holidays](#c0061n00245)).
- Advise patients who are on bisphosphonates for ≥5 years to monitor for symptoms that may occur as an AFF develops. Such symptoms include thigh or groin pain that may be unilateral or bilateral. If a patient receiving long-term bisphosphonate therapy reports such symptoms, plain film x-rays should be obtained. Bisphosphonates cessation and urgent referral to an orthopedic surgeon are required if x-rays demonstrate evidence of impending or incomplete AFF.
- The risk of AFF declines rapidly within a year of bisphosphonate cessation.​[[57]](#Black2020) Therefore, if an AFF is identified, do not restart bisphosphonate therapy. Consider an anabolic agent such as teriparatide to increase bone turnover and hasten repair.​[[58]](#Shane2014)​[[59]](#Gomberg2011)
- After the AFF has healed, refer patient to an osteoporosis specialist to reassess continuation of therapy. Alternatives to bisphosphonates, such as estrogen, raloxifene, teriparatide, denosumab or calcitonin, may be considered. Note that calcitonin use in this situation is off-label and there are concerns with long-term use and malignancy.

### Bisphosphonate Drug Holidays

Because of concerns about serious side effects and the prolonged duration of effect on bone, some recommend bisphosphonate *drug holidays* (e.g., after 5 years of oral therapy or 3 annual infusions of IV zoledronate, stop the bisphosphonate for 1–3 years, then re-assess). In particular, a drug holiday may be appropriate for patients who are not in the high-risk category, have had stable BMD and have been free of fractures during therapy. Patients deemed to be at high risk of further fractures are less likely to be considered for a drug holiday, but this is an area where solid evidence is lacking. In a subgroup extension of the Fracture Intervention Trial, the FLEX trial randomized patients who had taken alendronate for 5 years to either placebo or alendronate for additional 5 years.​[[66]](#c0061n00181) This study has been widely promoted as a rationale for a drug holiday after 5 years of alendronate therapy because patients in the placebo arm showed only a moderate decrease in BMD and no increase in nonvertebral fracture risk compared with those continuing alendronate over the second 5 years. However, in FLEX, there was a significantly increased risk of clinical (symptomatic) vertebral fractures in the placebo arm; these fractures are not trivial and are associated with increased mortality.​[[60]](#Cauley2000) Bone biopsies from FLEX subjects who took alendronate for 10 years showed normal bone. The FLEX trial therefore provides evidence of safety and further fracture protection for high-risk patients taking alendronate for 10 years.

Some retrospective analyses suggest increased fracture risk after a drug holiday. A recent systematic review found no increased fracture risk in women who stopped bisphosphonate after 3–5 years of therapy if they did not have low hip BMD, although women with low hip BMD may benefit from continuing therapy.​[[61]](#Mignot2017)​[[62]](#Nayak2019)

There is no clear evidence to guide when or whether to end a drug holiday. A reasonable approach would be to measure BMD after a drug holiday of 2–3 years and recalculate the 10-year fracture risk (FRAX or CAROC). If the patient has lost BMD and is in a high-risk category, resume treatment for another 3–5 years.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)​[[68]](#c0061n00263)​[[72]](#refitem-1142151-6EE0C518)​[[73]](#refitem-1142152-6EE14ED5)

None of the clinical trials of these drugs have been extended beyond 10 years, so duration of therapy after 10 years for high-risk individuals remains a matter of clinical judgment.

See [Table 2](#bisphosphonatesdrugholiday) for recommendations regarding bisphosphonates drug holiday.​[[63]](#Adler2016)

**Table 2:** Bisphosphonates Drug Holiday Recommendations

|  | Alendronate | Risedronate | Zoledronate |
| Moderate-risk patients (10-y fracture risk ≤20%) | A 1- to 3-y drug holiday may be appropriate following 5 y of therapy, if initial prescription was based solely on low BMD.​ [66] ​ [67] | A 1-y drug holiday may be appropriate for moderate-risk patients. Risedronate has a lower affinity to bone than alendronate.​ [70] Bone mineral density declined and bone turnover markers returned to placebo levels in the first year after risedronate was discontinued in 1 study (although fracture protection persisted in the year after discontinuation), suggesting an extended drug holiday may not be appropriate for patients treated with this agent.​ [71] | A 1- to 3-y drug holiday may be appropriate following 3 y of therapy in patients with no history of a vertebral or hip fracture.​ [68] ​ [67] ​ [69] |
| High-risk patients (10-y fracture risk >20%) | A 1- to 3-y drug holiday may be appropriate following 5 y of therapy in patients who were deemed high risk at the onset of therapy (10-y fracture risk >20%) if there has been no prior history of vertebral or hip fracture, no fragility fracture while on therapy, and femoral neck BMD T-score is >–2.5.​ [68] ​ [72] ​ [73] Drug holidays are not recommended in patients with a history of a previous fracture of spine or hip, as these individuals are at higher risk for recurrent fractures and the benefit of ongoing therapy is greater than potential risks.​ [6] ​ [72] ​ [73] | Drug holidays are not recommended in patients with a history of previous fracture of spine or hip, as these individuals are at higher risk for recurrent fractures and the benefit of ongoing therapy is greater than potential risks.​ [6] ​ [72] ​ [73] | A 1- to 3-y drug holiday may be appropriate in patients who have not experienced a fracture previously or during treatment. Patients should not consider stopping zoledronic acid until after the sixth annual infusion. Drug holidays are not recommended in patients with a history of a previous fracture of spine or hip, as these individuals are at higher risk for recurrent fractures and the benefit of ongoing therapy is greater than potential risks.​ [6] ​ [72] ​ [73] |

### RANK Ligand Inhibitors

Denosumab is the first biologic agent approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and the only RANK ligand inhibitor available for clinical use at this time. It is a human monoclonal antibody that binds receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), thus preventing interaction with its receptor (RANK) on the surface of osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. In this way, denosumab mimics the action of osteoprotegerin (OPG), the naturally occurring regulator of the RANKL pathway. Inhibition of RANKL by OPG or denosumab results in diminished osteoclast formation, function, and survival, and a marked reduction of plasma biochemical markers of bone remodelling. At the dose used for osteoporosis therapy, denosumab inhibition of RANKL lasts approximately 6 months. The dramatic reduction in bone resorption is accompanied by suppression of bone formation, but perhaps not as completely suppressed as bone resorption, as increases in BMD are observed through up to 10 years of therapy. In a large clinical trial, denosumab 60 mg given subcutaneously every 6 months increased BMD and reduced the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral and hip fractures in menopausal women with osteoporosis.​[[74]](#c0061n00213) The extension of the 3-year fracture prevention study to 10 years indicated continued safety as well as a continuing modest increase in BMD throughout the 10 years of therapy.​[[75]](#Bone2017) Denosumab has also been tested in a small study of osteoporotic men, with changes in bone density and biochemical markers of bone turnover similar to those observed in the large clinical trials of postmenopausal women.​[[76]](#refitem-1172155-B2D65242) The study was insufficiently powered to look at fracture outcomes, but there is no reason to assume that the drug would not be effective in preventing fractures in high-risk men.

Denosumab should be considered a first-line osteoporosis therapy, but as it is more expensive than generic bisphosphonate therapy, some practitioners prefer it to be used in more severe cases of osteoporosis: patients with a history of osteoporotic fracture, those multiple risk factors for fracture, and those who have failed or are intolerant of other therapies.

Unlike bisphosphonates, denosumab is not retained in the skeleton, and when therapy is stopped for more than 6 months, there is a rapid increase in bone remodelling, with loss of BMD gains over 1–2 years; recent studies suggest an increased risk of vertebral fracture in the first year after stopping denosumab.​[[77]](#Symonds2018) Drug holidays are therefore not recommended for denosumab therapy. It is now recommended that if denosumab is stopped, the rise in bone turnover, decrease in BMD and increased fracture risk could be mitigated with a 1–2‑year course of a bisphosphonate.​[[78]](#refitem-1172163-C75C977A)

Denosumab is generally well tolerated. Infrequent cases of AFF and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been reported with its use,​[[79]](#Watts2019) but as with bisphosphonate therapy, these risks are far outweighed by the fracture-prevention benefit. An increased risk of serious infections has been observed in patients taking denosumab; however, the absolute risk increase remains low. In the clinical trials, the overall risk for any infection was similar to that of the comparator.​[[80]](#Cohen2020) Hypocalcemia has been reported as a rare side effect, particularly in patients with vitamin D deficiency or renal insufficiency.​[[81]](#Daga2021) However, unlike bisphosphonates, denosumab is not contraindicated in renal insufficiency, as it does not depend upon renal function for removal.

### Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators

Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM); it acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast and uterine tissue, but has estrogen-like activity in bone and lipid metabolism. Like estrogen, it causes a modestly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene prevents postmenopausal bone loss,​[[82]](#c0061n00031) increasing BMD by approximately 3% and reducing new vertebral fractures by 30–40% (NNT=16).​[[83]](#c0061n00032)​[[84]](#c0061n00273) It also significantly reduces the relative risk of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer by 76%.​[[85]](#c0061n00033) It is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk.​[[86]](#c0061n00116)

A large clinical trial has shown that bazedoxifene, another SERM, modestly improves bone density and reduces risk of vertebral fractures, but not non-vertebral or hip fractures.​[[87]](#refitem-1172167-C75F96F6) The combination product containing bazedoxifene with conjugated estrogen has been approved by Health Canada, but only for menopause symptom management for patients with an intact uterus. The combination with estrogen seems to increase BMD slightly better than bazedoxifene alone, but not as well as estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate.​[[88]](#refitem-1172168-C7605BF4) Bazedoxifene is approved in the U.S. either alone or in combination with estrogen for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Estrogen and Progesterone

Postmenopausal use of estrogen or estrogen/progesterone hormone therapy (E/PT) is no longer considered first choice for treatment of osteoporosis.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)​[[89]](#c0061n00035) However, to prevent osteoporosis in patients experiencing early menopause (before 45 y), E/PT should be taken until the average age of menopause (approximately 51 y).​[[6]](#c0061n00018) For patients entering menopause at the usual age, Canadian guidelines suggest E/PT could still be considered a first-line option for those who wish to take an osteoporosis prevention therapy and who also wish to receive treatment for menopausal symptoms.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) For the treatment of established osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients over age 60, the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies showed E/PT is effective in preventing fractures but the reduction in hip and other fractures must be balanced against the increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease.​[[89]](#c0061n00035) It should be noted, however, that patients participating in the WHI were at low-risk for osteoporosis but had a high incidence of obesity and hypertension, increasing their risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. The risk-benefit ratio may be different for postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis, and the cardiovascular risk of E/PT was not seen in the patients under 60 years of age in the WHI.​[[90]](#c0061n00202) In a long-term follow-up (18 y) study of the WHI cohort, hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (median 5.6 y) or with CEE alone (median of 7.2 y) was not associated with risk of all-cause, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.​[[91]](#Manson2017) Based on the fracture prevention benefit seen in the WHI studies, Osteoporosis Canada guidelines still include estrogen as a first-line therapy for prevention of hip, nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, but limit the use to patients experiencing vasomotor symptoms. For hormonal therapy options, see Menopause.

### Calcitonin

Salmon calcitonin nasal spray has been shown to prevent vertebral fractures, but because of weaker clinical trial data, it is regarded as a second-line therapy.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) However, a review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) found that osteoporosis therapy with salmon calcitonin may be associated with a small increased risk of cancers.​[[92]](#c0061n00264) Both the EMA and Health Canada have withdrawn calcitonin nasal spray from the market,​[[93]](#c0061n00267) but injectable salmon calcitonin continues to be available for the early treatment of hypercalcemia and a second-line therapy of Paget disease.

Calcitonin reduces pain associated with acute vertebral fractures.​[[94]](#c0061n00219) The effective dose for off-label use of injectable calcitonin for vertebral fracture pain has not been standardized.

### Anabolic Agents

### Parathyroid Hormone, Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptide and Analogues

Teriparatide is a biologically active 34 amino acid peptide fragment of human parathyroid hormone (PTH 1 receptor). In bones, it acts on osteoblasts and osteocytes, stimulating an increase in bone remodelling, stimulating IGF-1 synthesis, activating Wnt signalling pathway for bone formation, and activating bone resorption via the RANKL synthesis. In the kidney, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption to raise the serum calcium. When given as a single daily injection of 20 mcg, teriparatide is a stronger stimulus to bone formation than to bone resorption, resulting in a net gain in bone mass and strength. In the dose used for osteoporosis, it does not cause significant hypercalcemia. The effects on bone microarchitecture include increases in trabecular thickness and connectivity as well as increased cortical bone thickness.​[[95]](#Hodsman2005) Teriparatide is therefore classed as an osteoanabolic agent. Treatment is associated with a steady gain in bone density and a 50% reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (NNT=9).​[[84]](#c0061n00273)​[[96]](#c0061n00047) Individual clinical trials were not powered to examine an effect on hip fracture, but a recent meta-analysis supports hip fracture prevention with teriparatide.​[[97]](#Perez2019) Teriparatide has also been shown to be effective in treating corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis​[[95]](#Hodsman2005) and may reduce pain associated with vertebral fractures.​[[6]](#c0061n00018)

The major clinical trial of teriparatide was stopped at a median of 19 months of therapy because concurrent teratogenicity studies in rats given lifelong treatment with very high doses showed increased incidence of osteogenic sarcoma. This finding is probably not relevant to its use at a lower dose for a much shorter duration in humans, and 15-year postmarketing surveillance has not detected any increased incidence of osteosarcoma.​[[98]](#c0061n00256) Due to the short duration of the pivotal clinical trial and the fears of osteosarcoma, teriparatide use has been restricted to 24 months’ lifetime exposure; however, the FDA has recently changed this restriction, allowing for a longer duration or restarting treatment if a patient remains at, or returns to, a high risk of fractures.

The price of teriparatide therapy has limited its use as a first-line therapy, but for patients with severe osteoporosis (including corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis) with fractures, it should be considered an option for initial therapy. There are few head-to-head studies, but teriparatide appears to be more effective in fracture prevention than bisphosphonate therapy.​[[99]](#Kendler2018) After teriparatide therapy is completed, the gains in bone density are rapidly lost.​[[100]](#c0061n00225) Therefore, subsequent treatment with a bisphosphonate or denosumab is advised, as much of the increase in BMD may be lost during the first year after stopping the drug.​[[101]](#c0061n00118)

Abaloparatide is a synthetic analogue of the first 34 amino acids of PTHrP. Like teriparatide, when given as a bolus daily injection, abaloparatide stimulates a shift in remodelling balance in favour of bone formation. As a modified analogue of PTHrP, it seems to have less of an effect on serum calcium than teriparatide or PTHrP. In an 18-month, double-blind, 3 group, randomized clinical trial (2463 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis received a daily injection of abaloparatide 80 mcg, teriparatide 20 mcg or placebo), abaloparatide and teriparatide were associated with significantly fewer osteoporotic fractures than placebo (4 vertebral fractures and 27 clinical fractures in the abaloparatide and teriparatide group, compared with 30 and 49 in the placebo group respectively).​[[103]](#Miller2016) Side effects were similar to teriparatide, with nausea, dizziness, headache and palpitations in slightly greater frequency than with teriparatide. At present, it is approved for osteoporosis therapy in the US only.

In a large placebo-controlled, 18-month clinical trial in patients at low risk of fracture, recombinant human PTH 100 mcg daily SC significantly increased BMD and reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures.​[[102]](#c0061n00184) PTH was approved for osteoporosis therapy in Europe, but the manufacturer has withdrawn it from marketing. At present it is approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.

### Romosozumab

Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against sclerostin. Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived glycoprotein that is important in regulating (inhibiting) the osteoblast Wnt/beta catenin pathway of bone formation. Thus, by inhibiting the inhibitor, romosozumab enhances the bone formation pathway. Also, the inhibition of sclerostin is associated with a reduction in bone resorption.​[[104]](#Solling2018) In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial (FRAME), 7180 postmenopausal women were randomized to 12 months of monthly romosozumab 210 mg SC or placebo. Both groups then received denosumab 60 mg every 6 months for 1 year. At the end of the first year, romosozumab significantly reduced vertebral fracture incidence by 73%. BMD increased at the lumbar spine and total hip by 13.3% and 6.8%, respectively, and after the second year (12 months of denosumab), the increase in BMD rose to 17.6% and 8.8% above baseline.​[[105]](#Cosman2016) A second phase 3 trial (ARCH) randomized 4093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive monthly romosozumab 210 mg SC or alendronate 70 mg PO once weekly for 1 year, followed by 1 year of open label alendronate. After 24 months, the romosozumab group showed a 48% reduction in vertebral fractures and a 27% reduction in clinical fractures compared with alendronate alone. There was an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in the romosozumab group (50 vs. 38).​[[106]](#Saag2017) Although such an increase in cardiovascular events was not observed in the FRAME trial, and despite the possibility that alendronate has a cardioprotective role, the regulatory approval of romosozumab includes a “serious warning and precaution box” against its use in patients with cardiovascular disease history (myocardial infarction or stroke).

Romosozumab is generally well tolerated; mild injection site reactions were reported in up to 5.2% of clinical trial participants. As with other osteoanabolic agents, when the patient reaches the end of the treatment period with romosozumab, the gains in bone density will be lost unless an antiremodelling agent is started.​[[107]](#McClung2018)​[[108]](#McClung2020) It is therefore recommended that patients be started on bisphosphonates or denosumab therapy following completion of a year of romosozumab. Unlike teriparatide, there is no lifetime exposure limitation to use of romosozumab, so it is possible that a second course of the drug could be given if the patient continues to experience fractures or lose BMD. The use of romosozumab in several alternating yearly cycles with an antiremodelling agent as a treatment of severe osteoporosis has not been yet tested in clinical trials.

### Strontium Ranelate

Strontium is a naturally occurring mineral that replaces calcium in bone matrix and causes a modest reduction in bone resorption in conjunction with a similarly modest increase in bone formation.​[[109]](#c0061n00119) Clinical trials of strontium ranelate have shown similar effectiveness in fracture prevention to that seen with bisphosphonates.​[[109]](#c0061n00119) Evidence for the efficacy of other strontium salts is lacking. Side effects appeared to be infrequent, but in pooling the clinical trials, an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events was noted in the subjects receiving strontium ranelate.​[[110]](#c0061n00200) The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends that this drug not be used in patients with ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, or in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.​[[111]](#refitem-1172179-C762BAB2) The EMA also decided that the risk of serious side effects associated with use of strontium ranelate (venous thromboembolism and a serious skin condition [DRESS]) outweighs the fracture prevention benefit. Therefore, the manufacturer has stopped its production. The drug may still be available from other generic manufacturers. Strontium ranelate is not available in Canada. However, some patients obtain strontium ranelate from Europe or purchase other nonprescription strontium salts, which are available in Canada. It is therefore important for practitioners to be aware that an advisory has been issued for all strontium salts; patients are recommended to avoid the use of these products if they have existing cardiovascular or thromboembolic disorders.​[[112]](#refitem-1172173-B2DA12EB)

### Combination Therapies

Combining a bisphosphonate with other antiremodelling agents, e.g., estrogen​[[113]](#c0061n00037)​[[114]](#c0061n00036) or raloxifene,​[[115]](#c0061n00220) has additive or synergistic effects on BMD, but no fracture benefit has been demonstrated.

For severe osteoporosis, combining an antiremodelling agent with an osteoanabolic agent, concurrently or sequentially, seems logical, but early results have been mixed. Early studies raised the possibility that giving an oral bisphosphonate beforehand or concurrently with PTH or teriparatide might blunt the anabolic response.​[[116]](#c0061n00251) However, combining teriparatide with either estrogen or raloxifene does not interfere with the anabolic action and may enhance it.​[[117]](#c0061n00120)

In contrast to combination with oral bisphosphonates, combining teriparatide therapy with yearly IV zoledronate, or 6 monthly SC denosumab injections appears to have more beneficial effects on bone density than either drug alone.​[[118]](#refitem-1172191-C76925D9)​[[119]](#refitem-1172192-C76969BB) In patients with severely low BMD and at high fracture risk, this kind of combination therapy may be considered, but cost is a limiting factor: most drug plans do not cover more than 1 osteoporosis drug at a time.

The sequence of combination therapy appears to be very important. Giving teriparatide first for 2 years, followed by denosumab, or combining both therapies for 2 years, then following with denosumab alone, results in greater bone density gains than giving denosumab therapy first for 2 years followed by teriparatide. In fact, following 2 years of denosumab therapy with teriparatide was associated with a marked increase in biochemical markers of bone turnover and loss of spine BMD over the first 6 months of teriparatide therapy.​[[120]](#Leder2015)​[[121]](#Leder2018) If cost were not a consideration, the optimal pharmacologic therapy of osteoporosis would appear to be starting with an osteoanabolic therapy and following with an antiremodelling agent. However, because of the higher cost, osteoanabolic agents tend to be used as rescue therapy after patients continue to fracture or lose BMD while taking antiremodelling agents.

### Corticosteroid-Induced Osteoporosis

Endogenous overproduction of cortisol (Cushing syndrome) has long been associated with osteoporosis, and the use of corticosteroids as potent anti-inflammatory agents has made corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis the most common secondary cause of osteoporotic fractures. Bone loss with corticosteroids therapy is due to increased bone resorption in the early stage of therapy, combined with chronic suppression of bone formation. The loss of muscle mass associated with corticosteroid therapy also contributes to increased risk of falling and associated fractures. BMD loss and increased fracture risk occur in most (but not all) patients in a dose- and duration-dependent manner.

For prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, all of the non-pharmacologic interventions for osteoporosis mentioned earlier in this chapter apply to patients taking corticosteroids. Fracture risk assessment tools like CAROC or FRAX incorporate corticosteroid use in the calculation of risk: exposure to oral corticosteroids for more than 3 months at a prednisone dose of ≥5mg daily (or equivalent doses). The 2017 American College of Rheumatology guideline document outlines an approach to stratifying risk and selecting which patients would benefit from osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy:

- For patients under 40 years of age, there are insufficient data to establish individual risk prediction tools, but long-term very high corticosteroid dose or prior fragility fracture should cause consideration of osteoporosis pharmacologic intervention.
- Adults over 40 years of age receiving >2.5 mg of prednisone daily for more than 3 months should have a BMD measurement within 6 months of starting corticosteroid therapy and a FRAX calculation. If the dose is a prednisone equivalent of >7.5 mg daily, the FRAX estimate of fracture risk should be increased by 15% (multiplied by 1.15). Patients at “moderate risk” of fracture as calculated by FRAX or CAROC should consider oral bisphosphonate therapy over denosumab or osteoanabolic therapy. Patients at “high risk” of fracture should also be offered an oral bisphosphonate, but consideration of IV bisphosphonate, denosumab or osteoanabolic therapy should be included in the discussion.​[[122]](#Buckley2018)

Osteoanabolic therapy addresses the corticosteroid suppression of bone formation more effectively than an antiremodelling agent, and a small trial found better BMD gains and fewer fractures with teriparatide therapy compared with alendronate.​[[123]](#Saag2009)

### Treatment of Osteoporosis in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk for osteoporotic fractures. All of the osteoporosis therapies are acceptable for patients above stage 4 chronic kidney disease (GFR 15–29 mL/min). However, the Health Canada–approved product monographs for bisphosphonates indicate restriction of use below a GFR of 30–35 mL/min, as bisphosphonates rely on the kidneys for excretion. In the clinical trials of bisphosphonates, a GFR of <30–35 mL/min was an exclusion criterion, but in the risedronate studies, some of the subjects had a GFR in the 15–30 mL/min range; a substudy of these subjects indicated risedronate was still causing a bone-density benefit without any evidence that risedronate was worsening renal function.​[[124]](#refitem-1172190-C772E14B) Denosumab, estrogen and SERMs are not affected by declining renal function, but if a patient is at stage 5 or already on dialysis, osteoporosis therapy decisions have to be made in conjunction with a nephrologist.

### Monitoring Response to Therapy

Monitoring osteoporosis therapy is an area of controversy with no clear answers. Even the occurrence of a new fracture may not signify a treatment failure, as treatment cannot prevent all fractures. Although clinical trials indicate all of the first-line therapies are associated with a significant rise in BMD in the first year of treatment, expanding that observation to individual patient monitoring remains a problem. The expected improvement in spine or hip BMD seen in individual patients approaches the precision limitations of BMD measurements, particularly for hip measurements. Consequently, some have suggested measuring BMD at 1 year after starting therapy is not likely to provide useful information.​[[125]](#refitem-1172191-C77219D3) Osteoporosis Canada guidelines still cautiously recommend using BMD measurement for monitoring therapy, but to reduce frequency to every 1–3 years, aiming at identifying patients with continued significant bone loss despite treatment. These individuals should be re-assessed, looking for secondary causes of osteoporosis; particular attention should be paid to adherence to therapy—taking an oral bisphosphonate with food means it will not be absorbed, and if adherence falls below 80%, antifracture efficacy becomes doubtful. If BMD is stable or improved, the interval between BMD measurements can be increased.

It should be emphasized that change in fracture risk as measured by calculators like FRAX or CAROC is not useful for evaluating response to therapy. Age is a big component of fracture risk in the calculators, and that probably works against any positive effect on BMD from treatment.

Serum or urine measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover have been recommended for monitoring osteoporosis therapy; in clinical trials, anticatabolic therapies will cause suppression of these markers, while anabolic therapies will cause an increase. However, there is a similar problem to that with BMD measurement in the individual patient: the changes in the measurements often exceed the precision error.​[[126]](#refitem-1172190-C77266A1) A lack of change in a biochemical marker may signify poor adherence to therapy, but there are more direct ways to assess adherence. With the injectable therapies, monitoring becomes less important, as the efficacy is high and adherence is known. Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended for routine follow-up of patients, but they may be helpful in individual cases where there is uncertainty regarding response to therapy.

### Therapeutic Tips

- A vertebral compression fracture, hip fracture or more than 1 fragility fracture after the age of 50 should be considered virtually diagnostic of osteoporosis irrespective of BMD testing. A single fragility fracture (e.g., wrist) in this age group should be considered a sign of osteoporosis until proven otherwise. Test these individuals with bone densitometry if available; they are still candidates for therapy if bone densitometry is not available.
- For the prevention of osteoporosis in early postmenopause, therapy with **estrogen** or **estrogen/progesterone** remains a reasonable choice if estrogen deficiency symptoms also require treatment. If menopausal symptoms are not a problem, **raloxifene** is an alternative, with the potential added benefit of reducing breast cancer risk.
- For patients with established osteoporosis (e.g., a fragility fracture and bone density in the osteoporosis range), **bisphosphonates**, denosumab, estrogen and teriparatide are all considered first-line options. Raloxifene is also listed as a first-line option, but in the absence of nonvertebral fracture prevention data, consider it only after the other first-line therapies have been rejected for individuals at high-risk of hip fracture. Consider an osteoanabolic agent as first choice for severe cases characterized by more than 1 fragility fracture and a very low BMD.​[[127]](#c0061n00122)
- For the prevention and treatment of *corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis*, oral **bisphosphonates** are the agents of choice or IV zoledronate if oral agents not tolerated.​[[6]](#c0061n00018) Teriparatide is also approved for this indication and should be considered as first-line treatment in the setting of fractures and low BMD.
- Men with a diagnosis of osteoporosis often go without treatment; while women are more frequently affected by osteoporosis, vertebral deformities (which may represent vertebral fractures) occur almost as often in men as in women.​[[128]](#c0061n00123) Hip fractures in men are also more likely to result in death or disability than those in women.
- High doses of vitamin A are associated with increased risk of hip fracture, so patients should not take double doses of multivitamins to try to increase their vitamin D intake.
- Although higher body weight is associated with lower risk of fractures and greater BMD, increased abdominal fat mass in women may be associated with higher risk of fracture.​[[129]](#c0061n00270)​[[130]](#c0061n00271)
- Because of the absence of fracture-prevention data, calcitriol, **androgens** and sodium fluoride are no longer considered appropriate alternative therapies.

| calcium Caltrate , Tums , generics <$15 | Total intake (from diet and supplements): <50 y: 1000 mg daily PO (divided to maximize absorption) >50 y: 1200 mg daily PO (divided to maximize absorption) | Constipation and nausea are the most common side effects. Other possible side effects include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, renal calcification and renal stones. There may be an increased risk of MI with high supplement doses. | Encourage fulfillment of calcium needs through dietary intake first. Calcium carbonate requires acidic medium for best absorption (take with or after meals); calcium citrate does not. May decrease absorption of bisphosphonates, ciprofloxacin, iron, levothyroxine, tetracycline. Separate administration by 2 h. Supplement doses >500 mg/day should be taken in divided doses. |
| vitamin D generics <$15 | 800–2000 units daily PO​ [65] | Possible side effects are hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, renal calcification and renal stones (usually at very high doses). | Increases calcium absorption. Many multivitamin supplements contain 400 units vitamin D and are the most commonly used preparation. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) is preferred over vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol). |

**Drug Class: RANK Ligand Inhibitors**

| denosumab Prolia ~$425/dose | 60 mg once every 6 months SC | Eczema, serious infections. Hypocalcemia in patients with impaired renal function. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was reported in trials using high doses (120 mg Q month) in oncology patients; risk is similar to bisphosphonates. | Increases in BMD may be lost after drug cessation. Keep refrigerated. |

**Drug Class: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators**

| raloxifene Evista , generics <$15 | 60 mg daily PO | Leg cramps, hot flashes, especially in younger postmenopausal patients. VTE risk similar to estrogen. | May aggravate hot flashes; should not be started until menopause is established. |
| conjugated estrogen /​ bazedoxifene Duavive ~$95 | 1 tablet daily PO; each tablet contains 20 mg bazedoxifene acetate /0.45 mg conjugated estrogen | Breakthrough bleeding/spotting, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, nausea, diarrhea. Increased risk of VTE , CVD , breast cancer. | For patients with an intact uterus. Not indicated by Health Canada for prevention of osteoporosis. May be considered for osteoporosis prevention in women <75 y with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. Do not crush or chew; modified release tablet. |
