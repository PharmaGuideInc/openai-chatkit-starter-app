### Pathophysiology

The skin and its appendages (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles) serve several important functions. The skin protects against minor injury, helps to control body temperature and water loss, prevents invasion by microorganisms, and prevents radiation damage from sun exposure. It is composed of 3 layers: epidermis (which includes the stratum corneum), dermis and subcutaneous tissue (see [Figure 1](#psc1164n00001)).​[[1]](#psc1164n1001) Acute or chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can result in skin damage.

### Ultraviolet Radiation

Ultraviolet (UV) light is divided into 3 categories: UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (280–320 nm) and UVC (100–280 nm). UV radiation is strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and at high altitudes and is intensified by wind, humidity, high temperatures, air pollution and reflective surfaces (e.g., water, sand, snow, concrete).​[[2]](#psc1164n1002)​[[3]](#SkotarczakKOsmola-MankowskaALodygaM-340A5A1D) Indoor tanning salons usually provide significantly more intense UV exposure than a person would receive from natural sunlight, particularly the levels of UVA.

- **UVA** radiation is present all day and can penetrate through clouds, windows, many types of clothing and water. UVA penetrates deep into the dermis and subcutaneous fat, leading to impairment of normal functioning of cells, blood vessels and collagen fibres as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species that can contribute to the destruction of proteins and nucleic acids. UVA is a less potent carcinogen than UVB or UVC, but is a significant contributor to skin cancer risk because more reaches the Earth than other types of UV radiation. UVA is responsible for reactions from **photosensitizing drugs** (see [Table 1](#psc1164n00012)). UVA also plays a significant role in the development of photoaging, immunosuppression, epidermal thickening and reduced skin barrier functions.​[[3]](#SkotarczakKOsmola-MankowskaALodygaM-340A5A1D)​[[6]](#psc1164n1003)​[[7]](#DruckerAmEtal.DrugSaf.201134821x201-FE89E3FF)
- **UVB** penetrates water but is filtered through clouds and windows. It does not penetrate the skin as deeply as UVA and is responsible for activating vitamin D3 synthesis. UVB is the main cause of sunburn, as acute exposure increases blood flow to the skin and activates inflammatory pathways. UVB also plays a role in both skin cancer and photoaging because, even at doses too low to cause skin reddening, it can cause local and systemic immunosuppression, direct damage to DNA and other skin cell abnormalities.​[[2]](#psc1164n1002)​[[3]](#SkotarczakKOsmola-MankowskaALodygaM-340A5A1D)​[[6]](#psc1164n1003)
- **UVC** does not reach the surface of the Earth, as it is filtered by the surrounding ozone layer.

The UV index is provided by Environment Canada and predicts the strength of the sun's UV rays. Higher UV readings indicate a higher risk of sunburn as the rays are stronger. UV indexes of 3 or more are reported daily.

### Sun-Induced Skin Damage

Sun-induced skin damage can occur in skin of any colour and can be acute or chronic as discussed below. Additionally, acute and chronic sun exposure can exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous lupus, rosacea and melasma.

### Acute sun-induced skin damage

Acutely, sun exposure can cause sunburn, phototoxic drug eruption, polymorphous light eruption and solar urticaria.

- **Sunburn** is an inflammatory response of the skin to UV radiation. It is preventable and generally self-treatable. Sunburn is characterized by erythema, with onset 2–6 hours after exposure to a threshold dose of UV radiation; it peaks at 15–36 hours and regresses by 72–120 hours. Erythema resulting from sunbed UVA exposure starts immediately, peaks at 8 hours and regresses by 24–48 hours. Edema, pain and pruritus may be present. Blistering in severe cases may take a week or more to resolve. Nausea, abdominal cramping, fever, chills, weakness, malaise and headache may also occur. Desquamation with resolution results from cellular injury and death. See Burns for assessment and treatment of burns.
- **Phototoxic reactions** are dose-related sunburn-like chemical reactions that occur within minutes to hours of exposure to sunlight in patients taking a relevant medication. The reaction is generally confined to the sun-exposed skin.​[[5]](#ZubaEBKoronowskaSOsmola-MankowskaEt-350B3E0A) Radiation in the UVA range causes most drug-related phototoxic reactions. Those taking medications that may cause phototoxic reactions (see [Table 1](#psc1164n00012)) should take extra care to prevent acute and chronic sun exposure (see [Prevention of Sun-Induced Skin Damage](#psc1164n00010)) and consider additional measures such as applying UV-protective films to windows.​[[10]](#OakleyAMBadriT.Photosensitivity.Sta-E745D236)

  In contrast to phototoxic reactions, **photoallergic reactions** are delayed hypersensitivity reactions after light exposure in predisposed individuals with an onset of 1–3 days post sun exposure. They may extend beyond the area exposed to light and occur only in a small percentage of patients.​[[5]](#ZubaEBKoronowskaSOsmola-MankowskaEt-350B3E0A)
- **Polymorphic light eruption** (polymorphous light eruption, PLE) is a common photosensitive disorder likely caused by a combination of genetic (family history) and environmental factors (sun exposure). It generally presents as an intermittent rash that occurs within hours of UV radiation exposure. The rash can take many forms but often includes groups of itchy pink or red papules, starting with the first intense sun exposure in the spring and decreasing in the fall.​[[11]](#LemboSRaimondoA.PolymorphicLightEru-E7B29D8A)
- **Solar urticaria** is a rare, chronic condition in which affected patients experience hives (red, itchy, swollen skin) after exposure to UV radiation from a natural or artificial source. The reaction can occur within minutes of exposure and may last from minutes to hours.​[[12]](#BadriTSchlessingerJ.SolarUrticaria.-E7B54FE1)

### Chronic sun-induced skin damage

Chronic exposure of the skin to UV radiation can cause photoaging, pigmentation abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions (e.g., actinic keratoses) and skin cancer (keratinocyte cancer and melanoma).

- **Photoaging**: The effects of long-term exposure to the sun are commonly referred to as “premature skin aging.”​[[13]](#psc1164n1006) They can be seen many years before normal age-related changes are noted in non-sun-exposed areas. The difference between the signs of normal aging and photoaging can readily be seen by comparing non-sun-exposed areas of the body with skin on the face, forearms and backs of hands. In photoaged skin, changes in the stratum corneum and epidermal cells result in rough, coarse, dull-appearing skin with fine and deep wrinkles. In more advanced photoaging, deposition of abnormal elastic fibres, decreased collagen and pigment changes in the upper dermis result in deeply wrinkled, yellowish skin. Vascular changes in the dermis can cause telangiectases and easy bruising. A change in the properties of water-retentive glycosaminoglycans contributes to the dry, rough, leathery appearance of photoaged skin.​[[14]](#psc1164n1007)
- **Dyspigmentation**: Pigmentary disorders such as solar lentigines (commonly known as liver spots or age spots) and ephelides (freckles) can result from exposure to UV radiation. Solar lentigines appear later in life as a result of prolonged, chronic exposure and appear as round, light yellow to dark brown spots on the face, hands, forearms, chest, back and shins. Ephelides generally appear during childhood after sun exposure in individuals with fair skin or red or blond hair. They are well-defined red or light brown to tan spots primarily appearing on the face, neck, chest, arms and legs.​[[15]](#PlensdorfSLivieratosMDadaNEtAl.Pigm-348032B6)​[[16]](#psc1164n1008)
- **Actinic keratoses**: These are common sun-induced lesions caused by chronic exposure. They are more prevalent in males and in light-skinned individuals. Onset is typically after the age of 50. They generally appear on the face, back of the hands, forearms and legs as a firm, scaling lesion with slight erythema. If left untreated, actinic keratoses can progress to squamous cell carcinoma.​[[17]](#psc1164n1009) [Prevention and Treatment of Sun-Induced Skin Damage](pvtn_treatment_of_sun-induced_skin_dmg.en.html) [and Photo, Actinic Keratosis.](#psc1164n01109)
- **Keratinocyte skin cancer**: Keratinocyte cancers (previously known as nonmelanoma skin cancers) include squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). SCC risk is related to chronic, cumulative lifetime sun exposure; therefore, people with visibly photoaged skin are at greater risk. Commonly found on the face, ears, neck, forearms, back of the hands and legs, it initially appears as an abnormal scaling or a crusty lesion that may be raised and wart-like. The lesions may bleed or erode over time, leading to firm tumors.​[[13]](#psc1164n1006) BCC is related to episodic sun exposure during childhood and adolescence and is commonly found on the face. It typically appears as small, dome-shaped lesions that may have a shiny surface (much like a pimple that does not heal) that slowly expand over time and develop central ulceration.​[[17]](#psc1164n1009)
- **Melanoma skin cancer:** Melanoma appears to be related to intense and intermittent sun exposure in childhood and adolescence. It occurs less frequently than other types of skin cancer, but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Risk is increased with chronic exposure to the sun, in those with a family history, blond or red-headed individuals who have skin that tans poorly and burns easily, and in those with a large number of moles, with a history of sunburns as a child​[[17]](#psc1164n1009)​[[18]](#SampleAHeYY.MechanismsAndPrevention-3483995D) and who use indoor tanning facilities, especially starting at a young age.​[[19]](#GhiasvandRRueeggCSWeiderpassEEtAl.I-348A67B6)​[[20]](#WatsonMHolmanDMMaguire-EisenM.Ultra-348AB6DC) Melanoma appears as a flat brown or black spot (commonly in a mole or other dark spot) with irregular edges that may grow larger if left untreated.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent acute sun-induced skin damage (sunburn)
- Prevent phototoxic reactions from medications
- Provide relief of pain resulting from sunburn
- Minimize the risk of infection in severe sunburns
- Prevent long-term sun-induced skin damage (including photoaging and some types of skin cancer)
- Reduce the visible effects of photoaging on the skin

### Patient Assessment

For a patient concerned about sun-induced skin damage, determine whether the goal is prevention (see [Prevention of Sun-Induced Skin Damage](#psc1164n00010) and [Figure 2](#psc1164n00008) and [Table 2](#psc1164n00016)) or treatment of sunburn or photoaging (see [Treatment of Sun-Induced Skin Damage](#psc1164n00017) and [Figure 3](#psc1164n00009) and [Table 4](#d2e2251)).

### Prevention of Sun-Induced Skin Damage

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic methods to prevent the acute and chronic effects of sun exposure include avoidance of direct sun exposure and artificial tanning beds. Patients taking medications that may cause phototoxic reactions must be especially cautious about sun exposure (see [Table 1](#psc1164n00012)).

- Avoiding direct sun exposure from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. when UVB rays are strongest as well as when the UV Index is high (≥6) decreases the risk of sunburn.​[[2]](#psc1164n1002) A person should seek shade as much as possible while outside. Children under the age of 6 months should be protected from the sun at all times by being in the shade and completely covered.
- Specialty sun-protection clothing with standardized ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) labelling decreases exposure. Fabrics with UPFs of 25–35 are considered to provide very good protection and those with UPFs of ≥50 are considered to provide excellent protection. If clothing with UPF labelling is not available, long-sleeved shirts, pants and gloves that are made from lycra or other tightly woven fabric, dark in colour, and lightweight and breathable offer the best protection. Clothing that is wet, white or loosely woven provides very little protection.​[[2]](#psc1164n1002)​[[22]](#LiHColantonioSDawsonAEtAl.Sunscreen-E744C503)
- Wide-brimmed hats of tightly woven fabric will protect the face, ears and parts of the neck from sun exposure, and long-term use may reduce the risk of skin cancers by 40%.​[[2]](#psc1164n1002)
- Sunglasses should be worn to protect the eyes from UV radiation, thereby reducing the risk of eye damage such as cataracts and eye cancer.
- Artificial tanning beds generally provide significantly more intense UV exposure than a person would receive from natural sunlight, particularly the levels of UVA. The common perception that indoor tanning will provide protection (a tan “base”) against environmental UV exposure (such as sunburn on tropical holidays) is problematic, as any protection afforded is minimal but risk of skin damage is significant. Tanning bed use increases the risk of basal and squamous cell carcinoma​[[23]](#psc1164n01086) as well as melanoma.​[[24]](#psc1164n01087) There is a dose-response relationship between amount of indoor tanning and risk of melanoma, and these harmful effects are even more pronounced in younger people.​[[19]](#GhiasvandRRueeggCSWeiderpassEEtAl.I-348A67B6)​[[20]](#WatsonMHolmanDMMaguire-EisenM.Ultra-348AB6DC) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that no one under 18 years of age use tanning beds. If used, time limits should be observed and protective eyewear should be worn at all times during the session.​[[9]](#WorldHealthOrganizationUltravioletR-3493A663)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Pharmacologic therapy for the prevention of sun-induced skin damage consists of the correct use of sunscreen.

Sunscreens effectively reduce skin tanning and burning when applied correctly.​[[26]](#NarbuttJPhilipsenPAHarrisonGIEtAl.S-492DE49E) Sunscreen use has also been shown to reduce photoaging and the development of actinic keratosis and promote the regression of existing actinic keratosis.​[[27]](#DarlingtonSWilliamsGNealeREtAl.ARan-492E1F15)​[[28]](#NaylorMFBoydASmithDWEtAl.HighSunPro-492EACA7)​[[29]](#ThompsonSCJolleyDMarksR.ReductionOf-492ED396)

Evidence for the effect of sunscreen use on development of skin cancer is limited due to the difficulty inherent in studying conditions that develop over prolonged periods of time. A systematic review was unable to demonstrate whether sunscreen was effective for the prevention of basal cell carcinoma.​[[30]](#Sxe1nchezGNovaJRodriguez-HernandezA-4930ACA7) However, a mathematical model has suggested that regular use of sunscreen during the first 18 years of life would reduce the lifetime incidence of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma by 78%.​[[31]](#SternRS.ProportinOfLifetimeUVDoseRe-492EFEC4) The only randomized trial showed the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was significantly lower in a group using daily sunscreen application versus a no daily sunscreen application group.​[[32]](#psc1164n01056) Studies have shown a reduction in melanoma with sunscreen use.​[[19]](#GhiasvandRRueeggCSWeiderpassEEtAl.I-348A67B6)​[[33]](#psc1164n01057)​[[34]](#WattsCGDrummondMGoumasCEtAl.Sunscre-4931AF58)

Experts agree that sunscreen use alone is unlikely to prevent skin cancer but should be considered an important adjunct to nonpharmacological means of preventing sun exposure.​[[35]](#WaldmanRAGrant-KelsJM.TheRoleOfSuns-49300DAA)​[[36]](#MancusoJBMaruthiRWangSQEtAl.Sunscre-351270F9)​[[37]](#IaconneMREtAl.EffectsOfSunscreenOnS-FE8AB613) See [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1164n00011).

The Canadian Dermatology Association recommends that sunscreens should:​[[38]](#psc1164n1012)

- Have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30
- Offer broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) protection
- Be nonirritating, noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic
- Be minimally or nonperfumed

Sunscreens can be classified as inorganic (physical) or organic (chemical).

- Inorganic sunscreens (e.g., titanium dioxide, zinc oxide) are photostable and work by reflecting and scattering UV and visible light. They protect against UV and visible light–induced photosensitivity. Physical sunscreens are generally thicker and less cosmetically elegant and may rub off easily or melt with the sun’s heat. Although they pose less risk of sensitization, their occlusive effect may cause miliaria (“heat rash,” “prickly heat”) and folliculitis. Micronized titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are relatively transparent to visible light and more cosmetically acceptable.
- Organic sunscreens work by absorbing UV light. The range of UV light absorbed depends upon the specific chemical used. Marketed sunscreen products contain combinations of chemical sunscreen ingredients in order to extend the UV spectrum covered and to address issues of degradation in the presence of light (photounstability). They are more likely to be irritating or sensitizing than inorganic sunscreens but are thinner, less greasy and more easily applied.

Antioxidants (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea polyphenols) have been added to topical sunscreen products due to their ability to scavenge the reactive oxygen species that are generated in the skin after UV exposure, theoretically enhancing protection from UV damage. However, antioxidants are inherently unstable and difficult to incorporate into products in a way that will maintain clinical effectiveness. As antioxidant stabilizing techniques evolve, they have the potential to increase protection from UV damage over sunscreen alone.​[[39]](#LimHWArellano-MendozaMIStengelF.Cur-43703369)​[[40]](#YeagerDGLimHW.Whatx2019sNewInPhotop-4370A2A0)

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Sunscreens.

Sunless tanning products can be chemical tanning agents such as **dihydroxyacetone** (DHA) or bronzers that contain extracts of walnut oil or jojoba. DHA is a dye that colours the skin when applied topically, taking 24–72 hours to take effect. It is resistant to soap, water and sweat; however, the colour change is temporary and will gradually fade over 3–7 days from the last application. These agents have a very low SPF value of 3–4 unless marketed in combination with sunscreen products. DHA is considered nontoxic and is regulated as a cosmetic rather than a drug. Bronzers coat the outer layer of the dermis only and last until they are washed off with soap and water.​[[41]](#psc1164n1017)​[[42]](#GaroneMHowardJFabrikantJ.AReviewOfC-3699BA3C)

### Sunscreen Labelling

Sunscreens should be used to protect the skin and not to prolong sun exposure. They should be broad spectrum, meaning they contain recognized ingredients that protect against both UVA and UVB (see [Table 2](#psc1164n00016)) and have an SPF of at least 30.​[[38]](#psc1164n1012) SPF is defined as the least amount of energy needed to produce erythema (primarily UVB) with sunscreen, divided by the least amount of energy needed to produce erythema without sunscreen. In Canada, sunscreens with the “broad spectrum” designation and SPF ≥15 may use the following statement: “If used as directed with other sun protection measures, decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.” Sunscreens with an SPF <15 or not designated as “broad spectrum” must use the following statement: “This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging.”​[[45]](#HexselCLBangertSDHebertAAEtAl.Curre-879D1E20)​[[46]](#HealthCanada.SunscreenMonograph.Jul-879D5987)

Although there is limited evidence that very high SPF (e.g., >50–100) may offer some increased protection in controlled conditions,​[[47]](#WilliamsJDMaitraPAtillasoyEEtAl.SPF-E7C42660) there are concerns that higher SPF numbers may be misinterpreted by consumers, e.g., thinking that a product with twice the SPF will provide twice the protection (in actuality, blockage of UVB rays may be only marginally better); not understanding that high SPF (mostly UVB coverage) may not be as protective overall as low SPF with broad (UVA and UVB) spectrum coverage; and encouraging underapplication due to the perception that high SPF products need not be applied as rigorously. As a result, many organizations impose limits on the SPF number that may be used in labelling. Products with an SPF >50 must be labelled as SPF 50+ in Canada.

Water-resistant products may be labelled only as “Water/Sweat Resistant (40 minutes)” or “Water/Sweat Resistant (80 minutes).”​[[45]](#HexselCLBangertSDHebertAAEtAl.Curre-879D1E20)​[[46]](#HealthCanada.SunscreenMonograph.Jul-879D5987)

Store sunscreen according to manufacturer labelling recommendations. Extreme temperatures (e.g., such as in a hot vehicle >8 h) may result in separation and discoloration of the product, which may affect efficacy.​[[36]](#MancusoJBMaruthiRWangSQEtAl.Sunscre-351270F9)

### Sunscreen Application

Sunscreen is not recommended in children <6 months of age, as direct sun exposure should be avoided in this age group. Seek or create shade using items such as stroller hoods/covers and umbrellas. Dress the infant in a wide-brimmed hat and lightweight, loose-fitting clothing that covers the arms and legs. In the exceptional case where sun exposure is unavoidable despite these measures, a broad-spectrum sunscreen for babies can be applied to the small exposed areas (e.g., face, back of hands).​[[48]](#CanadianDermatologyAssociation.SunS-372E38BA)​[[49]](#AmericanAcademyOfPediatrics.Sunburn-36A14B9F) Inorganic (physical) sunscreens containing zinc oxide and/or titanium oxide are minimally absorbed and less likely to cause sensitization.​[[50]](#psc1164n01112) Children 6 months of age or older should follow the same sun protection advised for adults.​[[46]](#HealthCanada.SunscreenMonograph.Jul-879D5987)

To ensure full effectiveness, sunscreen should be applied uniformly and liberally 15–30 minutes prior to exposure over the entire area of sun exposure, including lips, ears and tops of the feet.​[[2]](#psc1164n1002)​[[36]](#MancusoJBMaruthiRWangSQEtAl.Sunscre-351270F9)​[[46]](#HealthCanada.SunscreenMonograph.Jul-879D5987) It should be reapplied after swimming, sweating or towelling off and at least once during prolonged outdoor exposure.​[[51]](#MarrettLDChuMBHAtkinsonJEtAl.AnUpda-E84217E4) It is recommended that 2 mg of sunscreen per cm​2 of skin be applied to the body to ensure that the SPF protection claimed by the manufacturer is reached.​[[17]](#psc1164n1009)​[[21]](#GabrosSSitoPM.SunscreensAndPhotopro-348D0B42)​[[52]](#psc1164n1014)​[[53]](#PetersenNB.WulfC.ApplicationOfSunsc-879DE449) It has been suggested that sunscreen application is approximately 20–50% less than the recommended amount in real-world conditions.​[[53]](#PetersenNB.WulfC.ApplicationOfSunsc-879DE449) An easier way to measure the appropriate amount of sunscreen is referred to as the “teaspoon rule.” It is recommended that 1 teaspoonful (5 mL) be used to cover the face, head and neck; 1 teaspoonful to cover one arm (shoulder to fingers); 2 teaspoonsful (10 mL) to cover the front and back of the torso and 2 teaspoonsful to cover one leg front and back (hip to toes).​[[36]](#MancusoJBMaruthiRWangSQEtAl.Sunscre-351270F9)​[[52]](#psc1164n1014)

Many individuals do not apply enough sunscreen to attain the stated SPF of the product. Ensure that patients are aware of the proper application method and that sunscreen should be reapplied after sweating or being in water. Sunscreen vehicles affect the application of the product: lotions and creams are the most common vehicles used and are formulated as oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions; inadequate application may occur because the products may be greasy and less desirable than other formulations such as gels or sprays. Gels are generally alcohol-based and feel less greasy but can be drying. They may be preferred by patients with oily skin. Gels are easily removed when swimming or sweating. Spray formulations are convenient and less messy than creams, lotions and gels but they are often applied incorrectly, resulting in a thin layer of coverage and/or areas that are missed completely.​[[54]](#SambandaDR.RatnerD.SunscreensAnOver-87A5C213) Proper application of a spray sunscreen involves holding the container 10–15 cm from the skin, spraying liberally and then using the hands to spread the product evenly over the area and rub it in. Spray sunscreens should be applied in well ventilated areas (away from the wind) in order to avoid breathing in the product.​[[46]](#HealthCanada.SunscreenMonograph.Jul-879D5987) Lip balms with SPF may be more acceptable to use on the lips as they are formulated to stay in place longer without getting into the mouth.

It is generally recommended that sunscreen be applied before **insect repellent**.​[[55]](#GovernmentOfCanada.InsectRepellents-E7CE889E)​[[56]](#CentersForDiseaseControlAndPreventi-E7CED87E) The evidence upon which to base recommendations about the order of application is sparse. One study found that concurrent application of sunscreen with the insect repellent **DEET** lowered SPF by 33% and noted that delaying application of DEET after sunscreen application allowed the sunscreen to maintain slightly more of its original SPF.​[[57]](#MontemaranoADGuptaRKBurgeJREtAl.Ins-E7CA7770) The efficacy of DEET appears to be maintained whether it is applied before or with​[[58]](#MurphyMEMontemaranoADDebbounMEtAl.T-E7C9C1A4) sunscreen, although reapplication of a sunscreen-only product on top of DEET reduced the protection time of the repellent by an hour in one laboratory study.​[[59]](#WebbCERussellRC.InsectRepellentsAnd-E7CC9CFF)

### Sunscreen and Vitamin D

Vitamin D synthesis requires UVB exposure. In theory, 90% of the required vitamin D can be produced this way. In practice, the production of vitamin D is highly variable depending upon which area of skin is exposed to the sun and for how long, latitude, skin pigmentation, age and season.​[[60]](#psc1164n1013) There has been some concern that the increased use of sunscreen decreases the synthesis of vitamin D. Limited available evidence using moderate SPF (~15–16) sunscreen suggests that “real world” application of sunscreen does not affect vitamin D production significantly.​[[61]](#NealeREKhanSRLucasRMEtAl.TheEffectO-372A03EB)​[[62]](#YoungARNarbuttJHarrisonGI.OptimalSu-4924C6F0)​[[63]](#PasseronTBouillonRCallenderVEtAl.Su-4927D8C4) Further studies using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF are needed. The Institute of Medicine’s updated *Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D* concludes that the impact of sunscreen use on vitamin D synthesis needs to be clarified; however, it bases its vitamin D dietary intake recommendations on an assumption of minimal sun exposure and recommends the same daily intake irrespective of sunscreen use.​[[64]](#InstituteOfMedicineOfTheNationalAca-372AFD31)

### Sunscreen Safety

Limited animal and laboratory studies on the safety of some sunscreen ingredients or additives are inconclusive; studies are ongoing. The FDA is proposing new sunscreen rules that will require more rigorous evidence of safety of chemical sunscreens.​[[65]](#FDA.NewsReleaseFDAAdvancesNewPropos-3F4C6DDD) Systemic absorption of chemical sunscreens in humans is poorly documented, but some evidence has shown that absorption may reach levels sufficient to trigger standard drug safety testing, to which these products (often regulated as cosmetics) have not previously been subject.​[[66]](#MattaMKZusterzeelRPilliNREtAl.Effec-492A152D)​[[67]](#MatttaMKFlorianJZusterzeelREtAl.Eff-E845696F) Determination of the clinical importance of the absorption of chemical sunscreen ingredients requires further research and experts encourage consumers to continue using sunscreen given its extensive evidence of benefit.​[[68]](#U.S.FoodAndDrugAdministration.Shedd-AD867BAB)​[[69]](#AmericanAcademyOfDermatology.IsSuns-89AC23B9)

Concerns about the environmental impact of sunscreens have been raised, as it is estimated that 25% of sunscreen is washed off of swimmers within 20 minutes of exposure to water.​[[70]](#SillerABlaszakSCLazarMEtAl.UpdateAb-EEF952C0) Some jurisdictions (e.g., Hawaii) have restricted use of some sunscreen ingredients due to concerns about harmful effects on coral and other marine organisms.​[[71]](#GalamgamJLinouNLinosE.SunscreensCan-3F4D927D) Further study is needed.​[[72]](#SchneiderSLLimHW.ReviewOfEnvironmen-3F4F0CC6)

### Treatment of Sun-Induced Skin Damage

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Sunburn:

- Patients with minor or severe sunburn should avoid further exposure to the sun to prevent increasing the severity or extent of the burn and ensure they drink enough water to prevent dehydration.​[[73]](#GuerraKCCraneJS.Sunburn.StatPearlsI-415EC2D4) If further exposure to the sun cannot be avoided, the individual should wear protective clothing, apply a sunscreen and limit the amount of time in the sun during peak times (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
- Application of cool tap water compresses will relieve some pain associated with minor sunburn.
- Blisters may require dressings and wound care (see Burns). In the case of large blisters, they can be incised and drained with a needle by a health-care practitioner under sterile conditions. The overlying skin should be left intact to decrease the risk of secondary infection.

Photoaging:

- The most effective nonpharmacologic method to avoid worsening of photoaging is to avoid sun exposure.
- Light-based therapies (e.g., laser resurfacing and photodynamic therapy) and microdermabrasion are used for the treatment of the signs of photoaging.​[[15]](#PlensdorfSLivieratosMDadaNEtAl.Pigm-348032B6)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Care Products: First Aid.

### Therapy for Sunburn

Skin protectants such as occlusive ointments (e.g., petrolatum) and emollients (e.g., mineral oil) provide symptomatic relief of minor sunburns and redness. These products protect the area from irritation caused by friction from clothing and moisturize and rehydrate the skin. Bath and baby oils have minimal effect and peanut and corn oil are ineffective.​[[74]](#psc1164n1018)

Analgesics are used short term to relieve pain and mild inflammation caused by sunburn. They should be taken immediately after exposure, as inflammation generally occurs within the first 24 hours. Anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen **sodium** or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are recommended. Acetaminophen can also be used for simple pain relief if anti-inflammatories cannot be used.​[[74]](#psc1164n1018)

**Topical** aloe vera has traditionally been promoted for its wound-healing ability. A systematic review found that there is inconclusive evidence to determine whether aloe vera gel or dressings improve outcomes in acute wounds, including burns.​[[75]](#psc1164n01085) The amount of active ingredient in aloe vera products varies according to growing conditions, age of the plant, harvesting and extraction methods used.​[[76]](#psc1164n1019) Some patients may experience burning sensation, contact dermatitis or mild itching with topical use.

### Therapy for Photoaging

Treatment of photoaged skin may include a combination of nonpharmacologic therapies (see [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1164n00018)) and pharmacologic therapies. Pharmacologic treatment may also include combinations of various topical products for best results.

Commercial skin care products containing **retinol** have limited efficacy because the skin is able to convert only small amounts of retinol to retinoic acid. Products containing **vitamin A** do not contain sufficient concentrations of retinoids to effectively treat photoaging and are likely added for their moisturizing properties.​[[77]](#psc1164n1020) See also Topical Retinoids.

Antioxidants including vitamin C and coenzyme Q10 **derivatives** are included in many products purported to improve the signs of photoaging. Other compounds being investigated for their ability to reverse the signs of photoaging include soy isoflavones, green tea polyphenols, lutein, carotenoids, ginseng and peptides. In some cases there are (mostly) commercial in vitro studies showing promising results, but uncertainty around their clinical effectiveness remains because of the lack of independent, published in vivo evidence and questions about their effectiveness/stability in combination with other compounds and in the low concentrations that are available without a prescription.​[[78]](#BradleyEJEtAl.Over-the-counterAnti--8A3349E9)​[[79]](#PoonF.KangS.ChienAL.MechanismsAndTr-8A2E61E7)

Oral collagen supplements are widely marketed for treatment of photoaging. A systematic review of RCTs (mostly small and of limited quality) assessing oral collagen supplementation for wound healing and skin aging found improvements in skin hydration, elasticity and dermal collagen density.​[[80]](#ChoiFDSungCTJuhaszMLEtAl.OralCollag-43774F30) Larger studies incorporating standardized and objective assessments are needed. Adverse effects have not been reported; however, contamination is a concern as with all unregulated nutraceutical products.

Biotin (vitamin B7) supplements are also marketed as being beneficial for photoaging, despite evidence of effectiveness (in the absence of documented vitamin B7 deficiency) being limited to case reports and small studies. Concern about widespread use of biotin supplements has been raised, as high biotin intake can interfere with certain laboratory tests (e.g., PTH, TSH, T4, T3, troponin), leading to missed or inappropriate diagnoses.​[[81]](#FDASafetyCommunications.TheFDAWarns-4378CC2D)

Alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic acid and lactic acid) are widely available in low concentrations (usually 5–12%) in many commercial products marketed for photoaged skin. Although scientific evidence of clinical effectiveness is limited,​[[82]](#SmithWP.EpidermalAndDermalEffectsOf-8A9F560D)​[[83]](#StillerMJBartoloneJSternREtAl.Topic-8A3AEAD6) anecdotal evidence is widely accepted. These products may help reduce the appearance of minor photodamage by reducing fine lines, and improve skin firmness and tone by removing dead cells from the surface of the skin. Higher concentrations are required for deeper effects and must be administered under supervision of a dermatologist (see Chemical Peels).

Hydroquinone products are used to lighten darkened skin areas that appear with photoaging (e.g., solar lentigines/liver spots), leading to a more even skin tone. Hydroquinone interacts with melanin production in the lower layers of the epidermis. Skin improves over weeks to months. Recurrence is prevented by limiting sun exposure and using a sunscreen, particularly on areas that have been treated.​[[84]](#psc1164n1005) Skin irritation, redness and allergic or contact dermatitis have been reported. Hydroquinone can occasionally cause reversible discoloration of the fingernails and has been rarely associated with exogenous ochronosis (persistent blue-black or brown-grey pigmentation of the skin) particularly in dark-skinned individuals.​[[85]](#NaglerAHaleCSMeehanSAEtAl.Exogenous-8B2C065E) Some countries have banned hydroquinone due to concerns about carcinogenicity and renal toxicity after oral administration in mice and rats.​[[86]](#ShibataMAHiroseMTanakaHEtAl.Inducti-8B28E6C2)​[[87]](#HardGCWhysnerJEnglishJCEtAl.Relatio-8B2952E8) There is also some concern that hydroquinone may be harmful to the environment. In light of these concerns, products containing >2% hydroquinone require a prescription in Canada.​[[88]](#HealthCanada.RecallsAndSafetyAlerts-416F3ADE) Best results for hyperpigmentation include combining hydroquinone with other compounds used for skin lightening, including topical retinoids and topical corticosteroids (reduce production of melanin).​[[15]](#PlensdorfSLivieratosMDadaNEtAl.Pigm-348032B6)

**Topical retinoids** are thought to increase synthesis and inhibit degradation of collagen leading to less pronounced wrinkles, initiate epidermal proliferation causing increased smoothness of the skin and decreased melanin content, and enhance keratinocyte shedding leading to improvement in skin discoloration. They have also been shown to block skin degradation following sun exposure. Improvement is typically seen after several weeks of treatment. Continued treatment over 6–12 months results in skin that is smoother and less sallow, has reduced fine and coarse wrinkles, and is less mottled.​[[79]](#PoonF.KangS.ChienAL.MechanismsAndTr-8A2E61E7)​[[84]](#psc1164n1005)​[[89]](#HanA.ChienALKangS.Photoaging.Dermat-8A2E86F4) Only **tazarotene cream** is currently approved in Canada for this indication; however, in practice, other available topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene) are also used. Adverse effects include burning, irritation, redness and dryness, which usually subside over time. A titrated approach to treatment can minimize these reactions.

Chemical peels induce controlled damage to the skin at various skin depths. Regeneration and re-epithelialization of the epidermis and dermis result in firmer skin with a more even skin tone, improved skin texture, reduced wrinkles and decreased number of actinic keratoses.​[[13]](#psc1164n1006)​[[90]](#WolvertonSE.ed.ComprehensiveDermato-8AA2FABD) Chemical peels can be classified as superficial, medium or deep. Superficial peels are commonly used in mild photoaging and contain alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic acid 20–70%, lactic acid, malic acid) and/or beta-hydroxy acids (salicylic acid 10–30%). Medium-strength peels are used in mild-to-moderate photoaging and contain trichloroacetic acid alone or combined with glycolic acid (>70%). Superficial and medium chemical peels are relatively safe procedures when performed by an experienced clinician; however, complications such as irritation, burning, erythema, pruritus and blistering can occur.​[[91]](#Ox2019ConnorAA.LowePMShumackSEtAl.C-4169E06C) Deep chemical peels contain phenol and may require the patient to undergo sedation or general anesthesia. They carry a risk of toxicity and serious complications and may take weeks to recover from.

Botulinum toxins do not reverse photodamage but appear to rejuvenate the skin by relaxing the underlying musculature. The effects of treatment typically last 3–6 months depending on the degree of photodamage, the age of the patient and the dosage used.​[[13]](#psc1164n1006) Only onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA are approved for this indication in Canada.

Various injectable soft tissue fillers can be injected into wrinkles to improve the hydration and appearance of the skin. Hyaluronic acid is the most commonly used. Results usually last 6–9 months in areas with more movement and up to 1 year in areas of limited mobility.​[[13]](#psc1164n1006)

[Figure 3](#psc1164n00009) presents an assessment of patients requesting treatment for nonacute sun-induced skin damage (also see [Table 4](#d2e2251)).

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 3](#psc1164n00024) provides a plan for the monitoring of therapy for sun-induced skin damage.

**Table 3:** Monitoring of Therapy for Sun-Induced Skin Damage

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early photodamage (fine wrinkles, dry skin) | Monitor for changes in skin appearance (rough, dry skin with surface or deep wrinkles). Monitor regularly for signs of mottling or pigment changes (liver spots or age spots). | Skin feels softer, smoother, fine wrinkles less apparent. Skin does not show signs of pigment change. | Prevention is the most effective treatment (continual use of sunscreens with SPF 30 or more). Pharmacological treatment may improve or reverse signs (see Figure 3 ). |
| Sunburn | Monitor for 24–48 h after unprotected sun exposure for worsening or improvement of burn. Monitor pain for 24–48 h. Monitor for 7 days for signs of infection (particularly if blistered). | Sunburn lessens or disappears after 48 h. Pain relief is adequate. No signs of infection after 48 h. | Cool compresses to relieve pain. Analgesics for pain relief (acetaminophen, ibuprofen). Skin protectants such as petrolatum to protect and moisturize. Avoid further exposure. Signs of infection require assessment and treatment if appropriate. |
| Actinic keratosis | Monitor regularly for dry, scaly lesions on chronically sun-exposed areas (particularly age ≥50 y). Monitor closely for signs of change (size, shape, colour). | No signs of actinic keratosis, e.g., firm, scaling lesion with slight erythema. | Avoid chronic exposure to sun. Further investigation required if changes in the lesion (to rule out progression to SCC) or if any suspicious lesions elsewhere on skin (patients with AK are also at increased risk of developing BCC or melanomas). Wear sunscreens regularly and cover area to protect from further sun exposure. |
