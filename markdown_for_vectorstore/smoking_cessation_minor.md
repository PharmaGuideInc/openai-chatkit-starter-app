### Pathophysiology

Nicotine addiction involves a variety of physical, psychological and behavioural factors.​[[1]](#psc1007n1001)​[[2]](#psc1007n1002)​[[3]](#psc1007n1003) Nicotine acts as a stimulant, increasing alertness and the sense of well-being and elevating heart rate and blood pressure. Due to rapid delivery (within 7–10 seconds) to the mesolimbic pleasure-reward system in the brain, nicotine is highly addictive. With continued use, chemical and biologic changes occur in the brain and tolerance develops very quickly. Nicotine addiction is characterized by cravings that promote continued smoking and the tendency to increase nicotine intake to counter the profound physical and psychological symptoms elicited by withdrawal. There are multiple ways to consume nicotine: smoking, chewing or snorting smokeless tobacco, vaping and others. [Table 1](#psc1007n00002) describes various factors that reinforce nicotine addiction.

Nicotine addiction is now classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5​th edition (DSM-5) as tobacco use disorder.​[[3]](#psc1007n1003)

**Table 1:** Factors Reinforcing Nicotine Addiction

| Category | Reinforcing Factors​[3]​[4]​[5] |
| --- | --- |
| Physical | Pleasure or “high” similar to other addictive psychomotor stimulants. |
| Psychological | Behavioural conditioning resulting from hand-to-mouth ritual repeated on average 250 times a day for a pack-a-day smoker. Fear of weight gain associated with quitting. |
| Social | Routine activities associated with smoking such as waking up, phone calls, meals, coffee, driving, break time at work, and spending time with family or friends who smoke. Quitting does not eliminate these activities so they continue to act as triggers. |
| Withdrawal Symptoms | Dysphoric or depressed mood, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, increased appetite/weight gain, GI symptoms, headaches and insomnia. Symptoms generally peak 24–72 h after the last cigarette and subside after about 2 wk . Cravings can continue for years, and are probably related to behavioural and psychological aspects of nicotine addiction. |

### Prevalence

About 4.6 million Canadians (16% of the population) currently smoke.​[[6]](#psc1007n1006) Smoking tobacco is the number one cause of preventable death in Canada, killing over 37 000 people every year, which is more than car accidents, suicides, homicides, AIDS and other substance abuse issues combined.​[[6]](#psc1007n1006) Now considered a chronic medical condition,​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) tobacco dependency is the inability to discontinue tobacco use despite awareness of the health consequences.​[[8]](#psc1007n1008) All forms of tobacco use have harmful effects. These include smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco and “snuff”), pipe tobacco, cigars, hookahs and other nicotine delivery systems.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[9]](#psc1007n1009)

### Health Risks

On average, a cigarette delivers 1–3 mg of nicotine to the brain.​[[2]](#psc1007n1002)​[[10]](#psc1007n1010) Light or ultralight cigarettes may deliver the same amount of nicotine as regular cigarettes, regardless of the reported nicotine content, and are not safer than regular cigarettes.​[[10]](#psc1007n1010) Many factors are involved, such as more intense inhalation (“compensation”) or blocking of the vent holes on the cigarette filter by the lips or fingers.

The health risks associated with smoking (see [Table 2](#psc1007n01059)) are attributable to at least 50 of the known carcinogens among the 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, including tar, arsenic, formaldehyde, ammonia and nickel.

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or second-hand smoke puts nonsmokers at risk, accounting for over 1000 lung cancer or cardiac deaths each year.​[[6]](#psc1007n1006) Patients with chronic lung conditions may be most susceptible to ETS, with increased risk of asthma or COPD exacerbations. However, all nonsmokers are at risk of the effects of ETS, which also include eye and throat irritation, cough, rhinitis, headaches and various types of cancer, particularly lung cancer. In children it has also been linked to asthma, recurrent acute otitis media and sudden infant death syndrome.​[[11]](#psc1007n1028)

For those who do quit, there are immediate and long-term health benefits: improved breathing and sense of taste, and reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems and infections. Long-term smoking cessation has also been associated with mental health benefits, including improvements in depression, anxiety and stress.​[[12]](#TaylorGMcNeillAGirlingAEtAl.ChangeI-6EF522DD) Quitting before the age of 50 results in a 50% reduction in risk of death in the next 15 years.​[[13]](#psc1007n1029) The younger people are when quitting, the better their overall quality of life, with a significant decrease in mortality.​[[14]](#psc1007n01148)​[[15]](#psc1007n01149) Compared with those who continue to smoke, people who stopped smoking at 25–34, 35–44, 45–54 and 55–64 years of age lived 10, 9, 6 and 4 years longer, respectively.​[[16]](#psc1007n01167) This highlights the importance of assisting younger smokers to quit and, more importantly, preventing them from starting in the first place. It is also important to emphasize to patients with a long history of smoking that it is never too late to quit.

**Table 2:** Health Risks Associated with Tobacco Use

| Category | Potential Health Effects |
| --- | --- |
| Cancer | Cancer of the lung, pancreas, kidney, bladder, lip, oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus and larynx are all increased 2–27 times for smokers compared with nonsmokers. Smoking accounts for about 30% of all cancer-related deaths.​ [17] |
| Cardiovascular | Smokers have 2–4 times higher risk of coronary artery disease, 1.5 times higher risk of cerebral thrombosis​ [18] and increased risk of arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease.​ [19] Smoking cessation is an effective means of cardiovascular risk reduction and should be assessed in addition to blood pressure, lipid and blood glucose control. |
| Delayed wound healing | Wounds resulting from trauma, disease or surgical procedures heal slowly in smokers. Smokers experience a greater degree of complications as well as a higher incidence of unsatisfactory healing following reconstructive surgeries.​ [20] |
| Dermatologic effects | Premature aging of skin and wrinkling.​ [21] |
| Endocrine | Chronic smokers develop insulin resistance. There is also an increased risk of microvascular complications in smokers who develop insulin resistance.​ [22] |
| Musculoskeletal effects | Increased risk of lumbar disk disease and delayed bone healing. Decreased bone mineral density; though evidence of causality is lacking, bone loss associated with smoking could be expected to increase risk of hip fracture, especially in postmenopausal women.​ [23] ​ [24] ​ [25] |
| Oral contraceptive use | Cardiovascular events, including stroke and MI, are more common in women ≥35 y taking oral contraceptives.​ [26] |
| Oral diseases | Smoking increases the risk of oral diseases such as leukoplakia (white premalignant lesions on oral mucosa), gingival bleeding, periodontitis and ulcerative gingivitis, as well as lip, mouth and throat cancers that resulted in the deaths of 1108 Canadians in 2007.​ [27] |
| Peptic ulcer disease | Increased incidence of bleeding and perforated ulcers. |
| Pregnancy and postpartum | Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction (average 150 g lower birth weight at term); preterm and extremely preterm births; fetal and infant mortality; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); potential long-term effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes , obesity, asthma, certain childhood cancers.​ [28] ​ [29] ​ [30] |
| Respiratory | Smoking leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema,​ [31] as well as a higher incidence of lung and throat infections.​ [32] Patients requiring inhaled corticosteroids have less of a response than nonsmokers. |
| Sexual function | Erectile dysfunction is twice as likely to occur in smokers than nonsmokers; exposure to second-hand smoke is also a significant risk factor for erectile dysfunction.​ [18] |

### Goals of Therapy

The foremost goal of therapy is to achieve lasting smoking cessation. Health-care providers can help patients achieve this goal by:

- Supporting smokers in the precontemplative and contemplative stages of change to move to preparation and then action stages
- Supporting smokers who successfully quit to achieve long-term abstinence (maintenance stage)
- Initiating dialogue, providing education and following up regularly with patients

### Patient Assessment

Health-care providers are in an ideal position not only to help patients who have already decided to quit smoking, but also to identify smokers and assist them in making the decision to quit. An assessment plan for smoking cessation is presented in [Figure 1](#psc1007n01060).

Health-care providers should take the initiative to provide, at minimum, a brief intervention (<20 minutes) to assess smoking status and readiness to quit. This type of intervention can increase unassisted quit rates of 2–3% by a further 1–3%.​[[33]](#SteadLFBuitragoDPreciadoNSanchezGHa-6EF58626) Longer consultations (30–90 minutes) are even more effective.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[34]](#psc1007n1031)​[[35]](#psc1007n01116)​[[36]](#psc1007n1032) Though effectiveness is higher with longer interviews, brief interventions of even 3–5 minutes have been shown to be beneficial.​[[33]](#SteadLFBuitragoDPreciadoNSanchezGHa-6EF58626)

The following 3 main assessment questions can be used to initiate a brief intervention or discussion with a patient:

1. Do you smoke?

2. Have you ever considered quitting?

3. Is now a good time?

The patient’s motivation to quit is assessed by the Stages of Change model of behavioural change (see [Figure 1](#psc1007n01060)). The precontemplation stage describes the patient who is not even thinking about quitting. In the contemplation stage, the patient is considering quitting, typically in the next 6 months to a year. In the preparation stage, the patient has made the decision to quit and is preparing to begin the process. Next is the action stage where quitting actually occurs, followed by maintenance, where the patient has been abstinent for at least 6 months and is working at remaining smoke-free. See [Figure 1](#psc1007n01060) and [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1007n01078) for intervention strategies for each stage of the process.

If the degree of physical dependence is low as assessed by the Modified Fagerström Nicotine Tolerance Scale (see [Table 3](#psc1007n01080)), the chances of successful smoking cessation are good even with behavioural assistance alone. If the degree of physical dependence is high, e.g., Fagerström score ≥6, the patient will likely require some form of pharmacotherapy (with or without behavioural assistance) to achieve success.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)

**Table 3:** Modified Fagerström Nicotine Tolerance Scale

| Questions​[a] | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points | Score​[b] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette? | After 60 min | Within 31–60 min | Within 6–30 min | Within 5 min | ___ |
| 2. Do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it is forbidden? | No | Yes | – | – | ___ |
| 3. Which of all the cigarettes you smoke in a day is the most satisfying one (the hardest one to give up)? | Any other than first one in the morning | First one in the morning | – | – | ___ |
| 4. How many cigarettes per day do you smoke? | 10 or less | 11–20 | 21–30 | 31 or more | ___ |
| 5. Do you smoke more during the morning than during the rest of the day? | No | Yes | – | – | ___ |
| 6. Do you smoke when you are so ill that you are in bed most of the day? | No | Yes | – | – | ___ |
|  |  |  |  | Total: | ___ |

[a] For some nicotine replacement products, only question 1 or 4 is required to determine the appropriate initial dose.

[b] Initiate pharmacotherapy for scores ≥6.

**Score:**

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation includes various behavioural interventions and alternative therapies. Combining one or more of these methods may be sufficient for success in patients who are light smokers. It is also the most appropriate option for patients in whom pharmacologic therapy is contraindicated because of potential interaction with other medications or because of other physical conditions such as severe heart disease (see [Cardiovascular Disease](#psc1007n01105)) or pregnancy (see [Pregnancy](#psc1007n01103)).

Environmental changes can be made to assist a person in tobacco cessation. Smoking paraphernalia such as ashtrays and lighters should be removed from the home, car and workspace. It may also be beneficial, especially in the first few weeks after the quit date, to avoid or limit interaction with friends or family members who smoke. To help deal with cravings, advise patients to take a walk, practise breathing techniques, or take up a new hobby or project. Suggest healthy, crunchy snacks such as carrot sticks or celery to help with cravings and the increased hunger that can be associated with tobacco cessation.

Counselling approaches for patients at various stages of change might include:

**Precontemplation—Ask and Listen**

- Encourage patients to discuss their smoking openly and to think about quitting, e.g., “What do you like and not like about smoking?”
- Reinforce relevant health consequences of smoking, but avoid confrontational or judgmental comments or body language.
- When possible, use a personalized approach to initiating a dialogue, e.g., “I am concerned about the effect smoking is having on your asthma. Would you be willing to discuss this at some point?”
- Empower patients with belief in their ability to quit. Help them to remember what successes they have had in the past, no matter how small, and focus on the positives, e.g., “During your last quit attempt, what went well for you?” or “What is the longest time you have been able to remain smoke-free?”
- Provide information and reassurance that you will be available to help when they are ready.

**Contemplation—Motivate and Assist**

- Encourage patients to think about their own pros and cons for smoking versus quitting. Help them understand that the benefits of quitting are well worth the challenge.
- Be understanding if patients express ambivalence about quitting or seem discouraged from failed attempts to quit in the past.
- Provide encouragement and positive reinforcement of their desire to quit and reassurance about any perceived deterrents, e.g., “It is great that you are thinking about quitting. That is the first step towards success. I know you are concerned about gaining weight, but this is something that can be prevented. I can certainly help you with this. Let me know when you are ready to talk more about it.”

**Preparation—Show and Tell**

- Help patients set a quit date, ideally within the next 2 weeks. The patient may choose to quit abruptly on that day with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or to gradually reduce cigarettes smoked to help minimize withdrawal before the quit date.​[[37]](#psc1007n01166)
- Use the Modified Fagerström Nicotine Tolerance Scale (see [Table 3](#psc1007n01080)) to assess nicotine dependence, then help select the most suitable smoking cessation method.
- Address questions/concerns about smoking cessation, e.g., nicotine withdrawal, nicotine replacement products, triggers, past quit attempts, weight gain.
- Prior to quitting, encourage patients to avoid smoking in places where a great deal of time will be spent such as in the car or at home to help minimize the behavioural and psychological aspects of smoking.​[[38]](#psc1007n01151)
- Suggest avoiding triggers by removing smoking paraphernalia, e.g., ashtrays and lighters from the home and vehicles, and cleaning areas to remove the smell of smoke.
- Suggest strategies to deal with cravings, e.g., remembering the reasons for quitting smoking, distractions such as exercise, relaxation, taking deep breaths, low calorie snacks and seeking social support.
- Encourage patients to identify and inform individuals they will count on for support during the quit process, e.g., family, friends, co-workers.
- Inform patients of community resources available to assist with smoking cessation such as quit lines (see [Table 4](#psc1007n01087)).

**Action—Congratulate**

- Provide positive feedback and praise for taking the important step of quitting.
- Ask patient about progress since your last visit, e.g., “How are you dealing with cravings? Have you had any setbacks since we last spoke and if so how did they affect you?”
- Reinforce coping strategies that were successful or suggest new ones if necessary.
- Reassess medication use and suggest changes as appropriate.
- Continue to provide support and follow up periodically.

**Maintenance—Support**

- Continue to provide positive reinforcement.
- Work to prevent relapse and encourage long-term self-management.
- Remind patients of their own reasons for quitting and help demonstrate their success and progress, e.g., “You know, you have barely needed your blue inhaler in the past few months. This tells me that your asthma is under much better control since you quit smoking.”

**Relapse—Don’t Give Up**

- Remind patients that this situation should be considered a “learning experience” rather than a failure.
- Find out what stage of change they are currently in and assist them with getting back into the preparation stage.
- Identify triggers for relapse and discuss strategies for prevention.
- Help patients identify personal strengths and weaknesses and formulate a new plan of attack.
- Motivate and encourage them to try again no matter what, e.g., “Quitting smoking is one of the most difficult things to do and it often takes a few attempts before a person becomes completely smoke-free. With each attempt, you are getting that much closer to quitting permanently. If you are willing to try again, we can discuss. I am here to help.”

### Motivational Interviewing

Motivational interviewing is a goal-orientated method used to motivate a patient to change behaviour. Although there is a lack of evidence due to inconsistency and standardization issues, motivational interviewing can still be a valuable tool when properly used, to assist a patient in overcoming barriers and making a commitment to change.​[[39]](#Lindson-HawleyNThompsonTPBeghR.Moti-6EF75E55)

Some strategies and techniques in motivational interviewing include:

- Open-ended questions: Engage the patient in open-ended questions to encourage elaboration and discussion. For example, ask, “What do you like (or not like) about smoking?” or “What does your life look like to you 10 years from now. Are you still smoking?”
- Change talk: Engage patients in conversation that inquires about their own personal reasons for changing. For example, ask, “Tell me your reasons for changing or quitting smoking. Why are these reasons important to you?”
- Reflective listening: Listen to patients and paraphrase their responses back to them to gain understanding and perspective.
- Normalizing: Communicate to patients that the difficulties and barriers they may be facing are common for someone at their stage of change.
- Summarizing: Summarize points that have been discussed, specific plans of action, and personal reasons for taking that action.

For further information on motivational interviewing, see [Resources](#psc1007n01113).

### Behaviour Modification Programs

About 1 in 5 smokers preparing to stop smoking actually seeks formal help with quitting. Although smokers can become involved in self-help programs, health-care providers should be providing information on behavioural interventions for all smokers, regardless of the patient’s motivation to quit. For effective engagement strategies, see [Suggested Readings](#psc1007n00006).

Even brief advice to quit from a primary care physician during a routine consultation has been effective in increasing the number of smokers who remain abstinent for at least 6 months. Person-to-person counselling over 4 or more sessions is especially effective. In general, greater contact between the patient and the program provider leads to greater success.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[40]](#psc1007n1034)

Regardless of their level of nicotine dependence, encourage patients to participate in a behaviour modification program. Light smokers may be able to achieve lasting abstinence using behaviour modification alone, while moderate to heavy smokers benefit from the addition of pharmacologic therapy. The combination of pharmacotherapy and behaviour modification increases success rates in smoking cessation compared with usual care.​[[41]](#psc1007n01152) This further validates the importance of behaviour modification programs in addition to pharmacotherapy.

Even the simplest type of behaviour modification programs may be beneficial. Self-help in the form of electronic aids such as internet sites and text messages designed to assist individuals in quitting smoking may be effective in increasing the likelihood of long-term cessation.​[[42]](#psc1007n01153)​[[43]](#psc1007n01168)​[[44]](#CivljakMSteadLFHartmann-boyceJSheik-717DB622)

Support groups are more effective than self-help materials such as pamphlets or handouts, but more evidence is needed to compare support groups with one-on-one counselling.​[[45]](#SteadLFLancasterT.GroupBehaviourThe-717E57A6)

Many self-help materials, individual and group programs, and counselling programs are available to both health-care providers and patients. A list of programs in each province is available on the Health Canada and the Lung Association web sites (see [Table 4](#psc1007n01087)).

To provide optimum support for smoking cessation, health-care providers need proper training.​[[46]](#psc1007n01170) The “5 A’s Approach” is a universally adopted tool health-care providers often use as part of a smoking cessation program. The 5 A’s consist of: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange. Health-care providers can be trained in this approach via several programs including QUIT and TEACH (see [Table 4](#psc1007n01087)).

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture therapy for smoking cessation is based on the Chinese concept of energy pathways in the body. It involves special needles placed at strategic points under the skin of the nose or ear. Evidence of effectiveness in smoking cessation is not available; most studies were poorly conducted, yielding unreliable results.​[[47]](#psc1007n1035)​[[48]](#psc1007n1036)​[[49]](#psc1007n1037)

### Aversion Therapy

Aversion therapy is based on the concept that association of an unpleasant sensation with smoking can reduce the desire to smoke. Techniques have included mild electric shock, breath-holding, rapid smoking, unpleasant taste, noise or smell, and imagined stimuli. Good evidence to support aversion techniques is lacking; rapid or excessive smoking has shown the most promise; however, due to the potentially harmful effect on the heart and lungs, this method is not recommended as a smoking cessation strategy.​[[47]](#psc1007n1035)​[[49]](#psc1007n1037)

### Clove and Herbal Cigarettes

Imitation cigarettes containing ingredients such as cloves and various herbs are available. However, these products may also contain tar, carbon monoxide and various other toxins. Clove cigarettes may actually contain up to 70% tobacco, providing nicotine and the same toxins as all-tobacco cigarettes.​[[50]](#psc1007n1040)​[[51]](#psc1007n1041)

### Electronic Cigarettes

Electronic cigarettes contain a battery-powered mechanism to heat and vapourize a liquid chemical mixture composed of varying amounts of nicotine, propylene glycol, other chemicals and/or impurities. The vapour produced resembles the smoke of an actual cigarette, which may satisfy the behaviours associated with smoking (handling of cigarette, inhaling of smoke) in addition to nicotine addiction. Advocates of e-cigarettes praise them as a clean drug delivery device, although the chemical safety is unknown. For example, propylene glycol is a known irritant and the long-term effects on the lungs are unknown at this time. Additionally, the FDA conducted a preliminary analysis on samples of e-cigarettes from leading brands and found known carcinogens and toxic chemicals.​[[52]](#psc1007n01156) Although the analysis conducted was preliminary, it illustrates the lack of research on these products and the need for additional data on safety and effectiveness.

Electronic cigarettes are currently sold in Canada and are also available via the internet. However, since the production is not regulated, some electronic cigarettes contain nicotine while others contain varying levels of other chemicals. It is important to note that only those products without nicotine or health claims can be legally imported and sold in Canada.​[[53]](#psc1007n01158) Over 400 brands of electronic cigarettes are available.​[[52]](#psc1007n01156) There is world-wide debate concerning electronic cigarettes, since the potential benefit of smoking cessation may outweigh the potential risks. Current evidence does not support the use of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.​[[54]](#McRobbieHBullenCHartmann-boyceJHaje-6EF63742)​[[55]](#KalkhoranSGlantzSA.E-cigarettesAndS-E90340C8) Health Canada does not recommend using electronic cigarettes due to lack of safety information regarding exposure to vapourized propylene glycol (among other chemicals used in the products) and their unknown long-term effects.​[[53]](#psc1007n01158)

### Financial Incentives

Financial incentives are being used more frequently to encourage people to quit smoking. Although there has been some success with improved abstinence rates in the short term, the long-term (>12 months) efficacy of these strategies is yet to be determined.​[[56]](#HalpernSDFrenchBSmallDSEtAl.Randomi-717FD44E) Further research is required.​[[57]](#TroxelABVolppKG.EffectivenessOfFina-71807203)​[[58]](#RedaAAKotzDEversSMVanSchayckCP.Heal-71807C9E) One population that may respond to financial incentives is pregnant women. See [Pregnancy](#psc1007n01103) for more information.

### Hypnosis

Hypnosis is a deep, relaxed state of attention during which people are more responsive to suggestions. Hypnotherapy for smoking cessation attempts to change a person’s habits and attitudes towards cigarettes. The therapist’s skill and experience are very important, as are the patient’s susceptibility to hypnosis and desire to quit. Although there are reports of success with this method, a Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient evidence to consider hypnotherapy effective for smoking cessation.​[[48]](#psc1007n1036) If this method is tried, advise patients to combine it with behaviour modification or counselling. Follow-up counselling and support or combining the therapy with other smoking cessation methods may also improve the success of hypnotherapy.​[[47]](#psc1007n1035)​[[49]](#psc1007n1037)​[[59]](#psc1007n1039)

### Laser Therapy

Similar to the application of acupuncture, laser therapy uses laser beams that are directed at certain key points on the body surface. This stimulation of key points purportedly triggers a release of endorphins and relieves nicotine cravings. No reliable studies support this therapy.​[[47]](#psc1007n1035)​[[48]](#psc1007n1036)​[[49]](#psc1007n1037)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Pharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation can be divided into 2 broad categories: nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine therapies.

The purpose of pharmacologic therapy is to reduce the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal (see [Table 1](#psc1007n00002)), which peak within 72 hours and may continue intermittently for several weeks. In some patients, pharmacologic therapy is also needed to reduce the psychological effects of withdrawal (cravings), which can last up to several years, or as some ex-smokers will attest, indefinitely.​[[4]](#psc1007n1004)​[[5]](#psc1007n1005) While many patients may benefit from pharmacologic therapy, patients who are only mildly addicted may not require it to quit successfully. Pharmacotherapy may be contraindicated for certain patients because of potential drug or disease interactions.

Determining the most effective therapy from published studies is difficult. Varenicline, NRT and combination NRT have been found to be comparable at increasing the likelihood of a successful quit attempt.​[[60]](#BakerTBPiperMESteinJHEtAl.EffectsOf-EF2959FE) Other assessments have shown varenicline to be superior to the nicotine patch but comparable to combination NRT.​[[61]](#CahillKStevensSPereraRLancasterT.Ph-718B06EF) Bupropion is generally thought to be less effective than varenicline, but has been found to be comparable to the patch alone.​[[62]](#psc1007n1042) Some of the difficulty in interpreting results of studies is due to variations in study design and population, and differences in the definition of abstinence. All available therapeutic options increase the chances of a successful quit attempt. Recommend the form of therapy that is most appropriate and acceptable to the patient.

Alternative agents that are effective but with more side effects or less evidence are clonidine, nortriptyline and cytisine.​[[61]](#CahillKStevensSPereraRLancasterT.Ph-718B06EF)

### Nicotine Replacement Therapy

Nicotine **replacement therapy** (NRT), designed to replace the nicotine found in cigarettes, is the mainstay of nonprescription therapy for smoking cessation. In Canada, NRT medications are considered unscheduled products and can be obtained from any retailer without a prescription. Available dosage forms include chewing pieces (gum), lozenges, inhalers, mouth sprays and transdermal patches (see [Table 8](#d2e2703)). Nasal sprays and sublingual tablets are not available in Canada.

Nicotine replacement therapy increases abstinence rates by 50–70 percent.​[[63]](#psc1007n01169) The success of NRT is independent of dosage form, concurrent therapy and setting.

In general, the incidence of adverse effects with NRT is low provided the patient receives adequate counselling on the appropriate use of the product. It is important to consider that some contraindications may be relative rather than absolute contraindications, requiring clinical judgment in the decision-making process. Given the significant risks of continued smoking, the risk/benefit ratio for pharmacotherapy may be favourable even in pregnant patients or those with heart disease. These patients can often be successfully and safely managed with NRT or other pharmacotherapy under guidance of their health-care provider or specialist. See [Special Considerations](#psc1007n01102).​[[64]](#psc1007n1043)

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Smoking Cessation Products.

### Combination NRT

The combination of nicotine patch with as-needed gum, inhaler or lozenges may be more effective than the individual products, possibly because it provides a steady baseline level of nicotine with “boluses” for flexibility and treatment of cravings.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[62]](#psc1007n1042)​[[63]](#psc1007n01169) One study comparing combination NRT to NRT patch alone and varenicline found no difference in long-term quit rates of about 20% for all therapies.​[[60]](#BakerTBPiperMESteinJHEtAl.EffectsOf-EF2959FE)

For heavy smokers who continue to suffer withdrawal symptoms despite indicated doses, i.e., a single nicotine patch, it is common practice to increase the total daily nicotine doses by use of combinations of NRT products. Off-label uses include total daily doses of nicotine up to 35 mg per day for smokers previously using 21–40 cigarettes a day, and up to 40 mg per day for smokers previously using more than 40 cigarettes a day, with reported safety and improved efficacy.​[[65]](#psc1007n1045)​[[66]](#psc1007n1046)​[[67]](#psc1007n1047) These doses may be achieved by using additional patches or fast-acting nicotine, e.g., gum, inhaler, lozenge or spray, or a combination of patch and fast-acting products. Using more than 1 patch or total daily doses >30 mg requires appropriate health-care provider supervision.

Further studies are needed to define the ideal candidates for combination therapy. In practice, it would be reasonable to provide combination NRT to smokers who have struggled with NRT patches or other single forms.

### Non-nicotine Pharmacotherapy

A number of non-nicotine therapeutic agents have been investigated for use in smoking cessation.

Bupropion is effective for smoking cessation.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[68]](#psc1007n1048) Contraindications include a history of seizures, anorexia or bulimia nervosa and concurrent MAOI therapy. More common adverse effects include dry mouth and insomnia. Less common are hypertension, arthralgia, myalgia, dizziness, tremor, somnolence, bronchitis, pruritus, rash and taste perversion.​[[69]](#psc1007n1049) Some patients may develop agitation-like behavioural or emotional changes, which may increase the rare risk of harm to themselves or to others. Close patient monitoring is advised for all patients, but especially in those with underlying psychiatric illness.​[[69]](#psc1007n1049) As with other pharmacotherapeutic agents for smoking cessation, bupropion should be used in combination with behavioural programs to assist the quitting process, and can be used during pregnancy if benefit outweighs the risk.​[[69]](#psc1007n1049)

Varenicline is an alpha4 beta2-nicotinic receptor partial agonist used to assist patients with smoking cessation.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) It also may be an option for smokers who are unable to abruptly stop smoking. One study has shown that among cigarette smokers who are not willing or able to quit but are willing to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked, varenicline used for 24 weeks significantly increased cessation rates (27%) compared with placebo (9.9%).​[[70]](#EbbertJOHughesJRWestRJEtAl.EffectOf-6A560A6F) Patients should be advised about common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams and dizziness. Varenicline is contraindicated during pregnancy as there is evidence of reproductive toxicity in animal studies, though no human pregnancy data are available.​[[71]](#psc1007n1051)

Concerns regarding potential cardiovascular risks of varenicline​[[72]](#psc1007n01142)​[[73]](#psc1007n01143) prompted Health Canada to review its cardiovascular safety.​[[74]](#psc1007n01144) The review drew no firm conclusions due to small study populations available at the time.​[[75]](#HealthCanada.ChampixUpdatedSafetyIn-6B3AA481) Subsequent analyses, including a meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials, suggested no significant increase in cardiovascular adverse events associated with varenicline use.​[[76]](#psc1007n01159)​[[77]](#psc1007n01160)​[[78]](#MillsEJThorlundKEapenSWuPProchaskaJ-6B381BF3) It still may be prudent to cautiously assess patients before initiating therapy in those with cardiovascular concerns.

Safety concerns have also been raised regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms. Investigations into concerns regarding severe behavioural changes, e.g., suicidal ideation, depression or suicide attempt, have found no increase in these events in patients on varenicline compared with placebo.​[[79]](#GibbonsRDMannJJ.VareniclineSmokingC-6B3E9BFC)​[[80]](#ThomasKHMartinRMKnipeDWHigginsJPGun-6B3E9923) One study confirmed the lack of association but found a small increase in anxiety and mood conditions only in persons with pre-existing psychiatric disorders.​[[81]](#MoleroYLichtensteinPZetterqvistJEtA-6B3F876E) Regardless of therapy being used for smoking cessation, psychological changes should be monitored with every patient.​[[82]](#psc1007n01145)

Nortriptyline is a treatment option that has been shown to aid long-term smoking cessation. As with bupropion, the mode of action of nortriptyline is independent of its antidepressant effects and it has similar efficacy to NRT.​[[68]](#psc1007n1048) Clonidine is somewhat effective but of limited use because of significant side effects​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[61]](#CahillKStevensSPereraRLancasterT.Ph-718B06EF)​[[83]](#psc1007n1052)​[[84]](#psc1007n1053) (see [Table 9](#d2e3131)).

Cytisine, an alkaloid derivative of the Cytisus Laburnum plant, was approved in Canada as a smoking cessation aid in 2017. Acting as a partial agonist on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, cytisine has been found to be superior to placebo when combined with minimal behavioural support.​[[85]](#VinnikovDBrimkulovNBurjubaevaA.ADou-4A3583C2)​[[86]](#WestRZatonskiWCedzynskaMEtAl.Placeb-4A358279) An open-label, non-inferiority study (with adjunct brief behavioural support) comparing cytisine with NRT suggested higher rates of tobacco abstinence at 1 month with cytisine use.​[[87]](#WalkerNHoweCGloverMEtAl.CytisineVer-6B470620) Methodological limitations (open-label study design, self-reporting of tobacco abstinence) of this study may preclude its widespread application to clinical practice. Adverse effects include GI upset and sleep disturbances.

### Combination Therapy

Despite concerns over additive side effects, such as nausea, headache or dyspepsia, when combining varenicline with NRT, the combination was found to be well tolerated in 2 separate studies.​[[88]](#RamonJMMorchonSBaenaAMasuet-Aumatel-6B508F37)​[[89]](#KoegelenbergCFNoorFBatemanEDEtAl.Ef-6B4163F1) These 2 studies yielded contradictory results. One study found the combination to be superior to varenicline alone for cessation rates;​[[89]](#KoegelenbergCFNoorFBatemanEDEtAl.Ef-6B4163F1) the other found no benefit.​[[88]](#RamonJMMorchonSBaenaAMasuet-Aumatel-6B508F37) Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety of the combination.

The combination of varenicline and bupropion was studied in a group of people who were unable to reduce their smoking by at least 50% after 1 week of NRT.​[[90]](#RoseJEBehmFM.CombinationTreatmentWi-6B52255A) Compared with varenicline alone, subjects taking varenicline plus bupropion were more likely to be smoke-free at 8–11 weeks. The combination was statistically superior in men, but not in women. Smokers with high nicotine dependence were also more likely to be successful on the combination. This study was of short duration, but suggests that the combination is safe and may be effective for select smokers. Further studies are needed to better define the role of this combination.

Bupropion combined with NRT has been studied with mixed results. One study found higher quit rates in the combination group, but the difference was not statistically significant.​[[91]](#JorenbyDELeischowSJNidesMAEtAl.ACon-6B518572) Another study found no difference among bupropion monotherapy, NRT monotherapy or the combination.​[[92]](#StapletonJWestRHajekPEtAl.Randomize-6B52B621) A third study in patients with schizophrenia found the combination of bupropion and high-dose NRT had greater abstinence rates while using bupropion and high-dose NRT compared with placebo and high-dose NRT, but relapse rates were high and no difference in cessation rates was found at 1 year. This study was small and may have lacked statistical power to detect a true difference.​[[93]](#EvinsAECatherCCulhaneMAEtAl.A12-wee-6B5306A1) Based on the currently available evidence, the combination of bupropion and NRT cannot be recommended for routine use.

### Special Considerations

### Pregnancy

Nonpharmacologic choices are always first-line for pregnant patients, as behavioural therapy has proven effective for smoking cessation in pregnancy.​[[94]](#psc1007n01161) Financial incentives such as shopping vouchers demonstrated substantial evidence of efficacy for smoking cessation in pregnancy.​[[95]](#ChamberlainCOMara-EvesAOliverSEtAl.-DB1A0C8C) Psychosocial interventions such as social support and counselling can increase the proportion of pregnant women who stop smoking, which will help reduce the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth.

Evidence is insufficient to determine whether NRT is effective or safe for smoking cessation in pregnancy.​[[96]](#psc1007n01162) Women with moderate to high nicotine dependence will likely require some form of pharmacotherapy.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) One must balance the risks of continuing to smoke with the risks of using NRT. The products are not officially approved for use in pregnancy and **NRT** may have potential risks to the mother and fetus;​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[97]](#psc1007n1054) however, cigarette smoking during pregnancy may have far greater risks including exposure to the 4000 other chemicals in tobacco smoke. Most experts believe that if nonpharmacologic and/or behavioural strategies fail, interventions with NRT would be justified and can be attempted with close supervision by an appropriate health-care provider. It is important to incorporate behavioural interventions and to use the lowest effective dose of NRT. Initiation of smoking cessation is important during the earlier stages of pregnancy, ideally within the first 16 weeks.

Evidence shows that nicotine patches do not have a lasting effect on smoking cessation in pregnancy compared with placebo; however, use of NRT patches during pregnancy resulted in lower incidence of developmental impairment in the offspring at 2 years, compared with placebo.​[[98]](#BerlinIGrangxe9GJacobNTanguyML.Nico-6B54B1B1)​[[99]](#CooperSLewisSThorntonJGEtAl.TheSNAP-6B54BC9A) Further research is required to determine the safety and efficacy of NRT use in pregnancy.

If NRT is to be used in pregnancy, an immediate-release form of NRT such as gum, lozenge or inhaler may be preferred over a continuous dosage form such as the patch. Use the lowest effective dose, for the shortest possible time, to reduce fetal exposure to nicotine. If a patient is highly addicted to nicotine, use of the patch may be necessary. In these cases, use of a patch during waking hours only (e.g., a 24-hour patch applied for 16 hours and removed at night) can reduce fetal nicotine exposure. Close supervision and monitoring is essential for all pregnant patients and should involve the patient’s physician.

### Breastfeeding

Nicotine is excreted in breast milk when NRT is used. The risk to the infant for NRT-related nicotine exposure is lower than the risk from second-hand smoke, such as increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory infections or asthma.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) Intermittent use of immediate-release forms of **NRT** are preferred in breastfeeding mothers. Encourage the mother to breastfeed just before using the NRT product, to minimize infant exposure to nicotine.​[[97]](#psc1007n1054)

### Cardiovascular Disease

It is dangerous for patients with cardiovascular disease to continue to smoke. Smoking can activate coagulation pathways in the body, promoting thrombus formation and increasing the risk of myocardial infarction. Nicotine can also cause vasoconstriction as well as increased heart rate and contractility.​[[2]](#psc1007n1002) Despite this, many experts now believe that short-term use of NRT is safer than smoking, although there are risks involved with the use of NRT products. Evidence suggests that NRT is generally safe in patients with stable cardiovascular disease.​[[100]](#psc1007n01132)​[[101]](#psc1007n01133) Caution and supervision by an appropriate health-care provider are recommended, particularly within 2 weeks following myocardial infarction or in patients with unstable angina or serious arrhythmias.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[102]](#psc1007n1055) The transdermal NRT patch may be preferable to immediate-release dosage forms because of more consistent nicotine plasma concentrations.

### Older Adults

Although damage to the lungs cannot be reversed, quitting smoking can extend the time to disability or death regardless of age or smoking history.​[[103]](#FletcherCPetoR.TheNaturalHistoryOfC-6CDCB715) Even at older ages, smoking cessation is beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk.​[[104]](#MonsUMxfcezzinlerAGellertCEtAl.Impa-6CDCB9AF) Improvements in health from smoking cessation are achievable in older adults, making it critical to emphasize to patients that it is never too late to quit. The loss of lung function is not reversed but it can be slowed with successful cessation. Even at advanced ages, smokers who quit can slow the decline in function and reduce morbidity. See [#topic-11261-6CDC2EB4/fig-1129321-806A65CD](#fig-1129321-806A65CD) for an illustration of the impact of smoking cessation on FEV1 at various ages. **NRT** remains the therapy of choice in older adults due to experience and limited evidence showing efficacy.​[[105]](#CawkwellPBBlaumCShermanSE.Pharmacol-6CDCBBCD) Further research in this population is needed to compare NRT with other therapeutic options such as varenicline and bupropion.

### Children and Adolescents

Tobacco use is a major concern in the pediatric population.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) Experimentation with nicotine and drugs begins at 11–17 years of age or earlier in some cases. Nicotine dependence can occur rapidly in this population. Primary prevention is key, and health-care providers must deliver strong messages of prevention and cessation to this group and their parents.​[[106]](#psc1007n01165) Adolescents are interested in quitting. A survey of about 5000 11​th grade students revealed that approximately 79% would be willing to discuss or acknowledge their smoking habit if they were asked about it.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) This sets the stage for health-care providers to engage in tobacco use discussion—simply by asking the 3 main assessment questions (see [Patient Assessment](#psc1007n00005)). Many patients may not be ready to quit at the 1​st visit but a strong message to young patients and their parents from a health-care provider regarding tobacco abstinence and/or cessation is important in the prevention of youth tobacco use.

The current recommendation for smoking cessation in adolescent smokers focuses on behavioural approaches. Recommend Health Canada’s “Quit4Life” program to this age group (see [Table 4](#psc1007n01087)). Avoid incentive programs that use prizes aimed at prevention of smoking. They are not effective in adolescents.​[[107]](#psc1007n01163) Although NRT has been shown to be safe in this population, it is generally not recommended. Counselling is the most effective approach. There is little evidence that pharmacotherapy is effective in promoting long-term abstinence rates in younger patients.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) When pharmacologic therapy (including **NRT**) is required in patients under 18 years of age, it should be initiated and monitored by a health-care provider.

### Smokeless Tobacco

Discontinuation of smokeless tobacco products in post-MI patients was associated with an almost 50% reduction in mortality, similar to the benefit seen with smoking cessation.​[[108]](#ArefalkGHambraeusKLindLMichaxeblsso-6CDEE00A) This finding emphasizes the importance of encouraging users of smokeless tobacco to quit. Counselling is effective for treating patients who use smokeless tobacco products and should be considered first-line.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007)​[[109]](#psc1007n01171) Bupropion and NRT have not demonstrated long-term abstinence rates for smokeless tobacco cessation; however, NRT can be used in the short-term to alleviate nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline is an effective pharmacologic choice for tobacco abstinence in smokeless tobacco users.​[[110]](#EbbertJOFagerstrxf6mK.Pharmacologic-6CDE449E) High-dose NRT and combination therapies have not yet been studied in these patients.​[[109]](#psc1007n01171)

[Table 5](#table-1128331-83890717) can be used to estimate the equivalent number of cigarettes to smokeless tobacco consumption. The health-care provider can then recommend a trial dose of NRT therapy if that is the chosen pharmacotherapy.

**Table 5:** Smokeless Tobacco, Cigarettes and Nicotine Patch: Conversion and Dosing Chart​[[111]](#QUITQuitUsingAndInhalingTobaccoSmok-0124E50C)

| Pinches of Smokeless Tobacco/Day | Number of Cans of Tobacco/Week | Number of Cigarettes/Day | Suggested Nicotine Patch Starting Dose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | 3–5 | 7 mg daily |
| 2 |  | 6–8 |  |
| 3 | 1 | 9–11 | 14 mg daily |
| 4 |  | 12–14 |  |
| 5 |  | 15–17 |  |
| 6 | 2 | 18–20 (1 pack) | 21 mg daily |
| 13 | 4 | 39–41 (2 packs) | 42 mg daily |
| 20 | 6 | 60–62 (3 packs) |  |
| 26 | 8 | 78–80 (4 packs) |  |

### Drug Interactions

Cigarette smoking can affect the metabolism of many drugs. A major carcinogen found in tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is responsible for induction of hepatic enzymes CYP1A1, 1A2, and possibly 2E1.​[[112]](#psc1007n01164) CYP1A2 is the main pathway affected.

The effect on drugs of enzyme induction can take a couple of weeks to manifest. The clearance of drugs such as caffeine, clozapine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, opioid analgesics and warfarin may be increased in smokers. For example, plasma clozapine concentrations can increase by 72% on average when a patient stops smoking, due to decreased clearance.​[[113]](#LucasCMartinJ.SmokingAndDrugInterac-8303BE7D) Furthermore, smokers may require higher doses of warfarin, up to an additional 2.26 mg per week, compared with nonsmokers, due to CYP1A2 induction.​[[113]](#LucasCMartinJ.SmokingAndDrugInterac-8303BE7D) As a result, INR should be monitored more frequently when a patient quits smoking.

Monitoring drug therapy is essential and dosage reduction may be required upon smoking cessation.​[[112]](#psc1007n01164)​[[113]](#LucasCMartinJ.SmokingAndDrugInterac-8303BE7D) Assess for drug interactions or refer patients to an appropriate health-care provider if they are taking drugs that may be affected by smoking and are planning to quit. Reduction of caffeine intake is advised to minimize caffeine-induced palpitations, agitation and other side effects during and after the quit attempt. Potential interactions involving tobacco smoke are listed in [Table 6](#table-1129321-82FEC089).

Nicotine does not induce enzymes, so drug interactions occur with tobacco smoke but not with NRT.

**Table 6:** Drug Interactions with Tobacco Smoke​[[112]](#psc1007n01164)[[114]](#FankhauserMP.DrugInteractionsWithTo-8303BB0A)[[113]](#LucasCMartinJ.SmokingAndDrugInterac-8303BE7D)

| Drug/Class | Suggested Clinical Management |
| --- | --- |
| acetaminophen caffeine clozapine diazepam estrogens fluvoxamine methadone nifedipine olanzapine opioid analgesics, e.g., oxycodone, codeine rasagiline theophylline warfarin | When patient stops smoking: |
| Consider decreasing dose based on clinical and adverse effects. Clinical management requires individualization of approach based on needs and response of the patient. Recommend decreasing caffeine intake by 50% upon initiation of cessation attempt. |
| When patient starts smoking: |
| Consider increasing dose if clinical effect appears to be lessened. Clinical management requires individualization of approach based on needs and response of the patient. |

### Monitoring of Therapy

Because of the large behavioural component of smoking cessation, monitoring of therapy is crucial to success. Ideally, the patient receives ongoing monitoring for a period of time by a clinician or therapist involved with a smoking cessation program (see [Table 7](#psc1007n01110)). If monitoring is not available from the program, health-care providers should offer it.

**Table 7:** Monitoring of Therapy for Smoking Cessation​​[[a]](#afn14387)

| Parameter | Indicators/Goal/Time Frame | Suggested Monitoring Frequency | Recommended Interventions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Smoking | Patient reports no smoking. | Patient: Daily HCP : Monthly × 3 months then at 6 and 12 months | Inquire about amount smoked; provide encouragement and support. If patient has a relapse, discontinue nicotine replacement therapy until patient is ready to quit again; encourage patient to reset a quit date; discuss possible reasons for relapse and help patient strategize about how to be more successful with the next quit attempt; be empathetic and avoid scolding the patient. |
| Desire to smoke | Patient reports level of desire decreasing to minimal (or none) by end of therapy (3–6 months) ; cravings may never completely end for some. | As above | Intense craving may require alternate treatment (see Table 8 and Table 9 ). Encourage behavioural changes to decrease desire; empathize with patient’s difficulty and strongly encourage perseverance. |
| Nicotine withdrawal symptoms | Patient on NRT reports reduction in withdrawal symptoms (see Table 1 ) within 25 min to 24 h of initiating therapy. | As above | If symptoms are bothersome, consider increasing dose of NRT , if using, or switching to or adding an alternate therapy (see Table 8 and Table 9 ). Remind patients that the most difficult period is the first 2–14 days . Recommend additional behavioural interventions if necessary. |
| Medication adverse effects | Patient reports no adverse effects when questioned specifically throughout duration of pharmacotherapeutic treatment. | As above | If minor side effects occur, suggest ways to modify, e.g., for belching, hiccups and GI upset with gum, advise proper chewing technique, or consider switching to an alternative method of NRT . If serious adverse effects occur (e.g., hypertension, nicotine toxicity, mood changes, seizures), consider reducing dose or discontinuing medication and/or switching to alternate therapy (see Table 8 and Table 9 ). |
| Weight gain​ [115] ​ [116] | Patient reports minimal or no weight gain over the 6–12 months following quitting. | Patient : Weekly HCP : 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months | Encourage healthy eating habits, exercise, healthy snacks to deal with cravings, e.g., carrot sticks, to prevent or minimize weight gain. Reassure patient that slight weight gain is less harmful to their health than continued smoking. |
| Stress | Patient reports minimal additional stress due to smoking cessation over the 6–12 months following quitting. | Patient: Daily HCP : 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months | Assess for evidence of excessive stress, e.g., weight loss, nervous habits, GI symptoms, headache. Suggest behavioural therapy, e.g., deep breathing, muscle relaxation, positive self-talk, or refer to stress-management program. Encourage exercise and other distracting activities. Treat stress-related symptoms as needed (recommend appropriate medication to reduce stress or treat stress-related physical symptoms). |
| Mood | Patient reports minimal mood changes due to smoking cessation. | Patient: daily HCP : 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months | Assess for any signs of depression, severe agitation or mood changes. Family and/or caregivers should be informed and alerted to watch for these changes or symptoms. |

Relapse rates are high, particularly at the beginning of smoking cessation attempts, with 66% of patients reportedly relapsing within 48 hours and 76% within the 1​st week of unassisted quit attempts.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) Follow-up should begin within the initial week following the quit date, particularly if the patient is receiving NRT, to avoid adverse effects from excessive nicotine levels. Follow-up counselling should be provided regularly, e.g., every month for 3 months, then at 6 and 12 months. In general, more counselling time yields higher abstinence rates.​[[7]](#psc1007n1007) Additional monitoring should be considered for patients who are at high risk, e.g., highly nicotine-addicted patients with history of many previous smoking cessation attempts, patients experiencing severe psychosocial stress, those with comorbid substance abuse disorders or a history of depression or schizophrenia, patients taking concomitant medication that interacts with nicotine, or cases where smoking cessation is medically urgent. A suggested schedule for more intensive monitoring might involve follow-up every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months.

**Drug Class: Nicotine replacement, sustained-release**

| nicotine transdermal patch Habitrol , Nicoderm , generics $50–75 | Apply patch to nonhairy, clean, dry skin site on upper arm or hip; use a different site each day; avoid using the same site more than once weekly Apply upon waking and wear 16– 24 h per day, depending on product General dosing instructions involve 6 wk of use of highest strength ( 21 mg for Nicoderm or Habitrol, 15 mg for Nicorette) followed by 2 wk at the intermediate strength then 2 wk at the lowest strength. Consult individual product monographs for details Peak: 2–6 h | Local skin reactions: erythema, pruritus, edema, blisters, rash, burning sensation. CNS : headache, dizziness, paresthesia, insomnia, abnormal dreams, depression, somnolence, anxiety, emotional lability. Cardiovascular: palpitations, chest pain, blood pressure changes, tachycardia. GI : abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, flatulence, stomatitis. Respiratory: cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis, dyspnea, sinusitis. Other: myalgia, arthralgia, dysmenorrhea, toothache, sweating, taste perversion. | Life-threatening arrhythmia; severe angina pectoris; history of recent stroke; temporomandibular joint disease; within 2 wk following myocardial infarction. Relative contraindications: pregnancy, smoking while using this medication (nicotine toxicity), breastfeeding, age <18 y . Caution in hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, insulin-dependent diabetes, active peptic ulcer, uncontrolled hypertension. Other contraindications: generalized skin disorders (severe eczema or psoriasis); hypersensitivity to topical adhesives or nicotine. Other relative contraindications: mild atopic or eczematous dermatitis. | Assess patient in first 2 wk to ensure smoking has been discontinued. Wearing patch during strenuous exercise may increase absorption and adverse effects. Used patches should be folded so that medicated sides are facing inward and discarded safely out of reach of children or pets. Manufacturers do not recommend cutting patches as this may damage the delivery device. Patients who experience insomnia from the 24-hour patch may benefit from removing the patch at night and using an immediate-release product first thing in the morning, then applying a new patch. |

**Table 9:** Non-nicotine Therapy for Smoking Cessation

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Alpha2-adrenergic Receptor Agonists**

| clonidine generics < $25 | 0.1 mg BID PO starting up to 3 days before or on the quit date. Titrate up by 0.1 mg/day PO once per week as tolerated to a maximum of 0.4 mg/day . Duration of therapy ranges from 3– 10 wk | Common: sedation, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth. Less common: anxiety, irritability, memory problems. | Avoid concurrent use with tricyclic antidepressants. Additive effects with other CNS depressants such as ethanol. Additive hypotensive effect when combined with antihypertensive drugs. | Monitor blood pressure and heart rate during treatment initiation. Taper gradually to avoid rebound hypertension when stopping treatment. |

**Drug Class: Antidepressants**

| bupropion Zyban $50–75 | 150 mg daily PO × 3 days then 150 mg BID PO × 7–12 wk Begin 1–2 wk before the selected quit date | Usual: insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, restlessness, difficulty concentrating. Unusual: hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of seizures at higher dosages; agitation-type reactions involving mood/behavioural changes. | Inhibits CYP 2D6; may decrease clearance of atomoxetine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, risperidone, sertraline, venlafaxine; may decrease effectiveness of codeine and tamoxifen. Do not use with MAOI s (possible mania, excitation, hyperpyrexia).

Inducers of CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4 such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampin may decrease effect. Inhibitors of CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4 such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine or paroxetine may increase effect and toxicity. | Not recommended in patients with conditions predisposing to seizures, history of seizures, current eating disorder or severe hepatic impairment. Least expensive of oral medications officially indicated for smoking cessation. Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or arrhythmias. Consider measuring serum levels to reach therapeutic dose (based on efficacy data for depression). |

**Drug Class: Nicotine Receptor Partial Agonists**

| cytisine Cravv $25–50 | Days 1–3: 1 capsule Q2H (up to 6 capsules/day) while gradually reducing cigarette intake Days 4–12: 1 capsule Q2.5H (up to 5 capsules/day) .
