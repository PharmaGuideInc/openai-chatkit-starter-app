### Introduction

Opportunistic infections (OIs) were a major cause of mortality and morbidity in people living with HIV (PLWH) in the past. The INSIGHT START study demonstrated that early use of combination antiretroviral therapy can decrease both HIV-related OIs and non-HIV-related comorbidity.​[[1]](#INSIGHTSTARTStudyGroupLundgrenJDBab-8D4DD5CA) Despite recommendations for widespread testing for HIV,​[[2]](#CenterForDiseaseControlAndPreventio-8D4E0D6B) many remain undiagnosed and an OI may be the first evidence of immunodeficiency leading to the diagnosis of HIV or AIDS. In fact, in many settings, 20–50% of new diagnoses of HIV are made in late presenters.​[[3]](#OpDeCoulELVanSighemABrinkmanKEtAl.F-8D4E5B54) Susceptibility to specific opportunistic infections increases as the CD4 (helper T cell) count declines. This relationship is very useful in the differential diagnosis of various infectious syndromes, especially at CD4 counts <200 cells/mcL.​[[4]](#c0102n00614)

The [Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/whats-new-guidelines) are an invaluable electronic resource. They are comprehensive and updated frequently.

This chapter provides information for OIs in adults and adolescents only; for children, consult an infectious disease specialist in addition to the [Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/pediatric-arv/whats-new).

### Goals of Therapy

Primary-care or hospital-based practitioners should contact an HIV specialty clinic (available in most major centres) before initiating antiretroviral therapy if they are not comfortable managing HIV. In a medically unstable patient, the importance of supportive and OI-directed therapy far outweighs the need for immediate antiretroviral therapy.

Initiate antiretroviral therapy at diagnosis as appropriate, keeping in mind individual patient preference and risk of acquired drug resistance if patients are unable to adhere to antiretroviral therapy. Goals of therapy are to:

- Prevent specific infections
- Treat established opportunistic infections
- Reduce drug burden by discontinuing chemoprophylactic regimens and maintenance therapy for OIs when appropriate
- Minimize drug interactions during prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections
- Prevent transmission of HIV and STIs

### Investigations

All patients should have a complete history and physical to rule out potential OI and get a baseline assessment of their overall health. The initial investigations will be predicated on whether the patient is symptomatic. If a patient is asymptomatic, the following tests establish a baseline for determining the susceptibility to reactivation of various opportunistic infections.​[[5]](#c0102n00452) In general, latent infections can reactivate as the CD4 count declines.

- CBC
- Lymphocyte flow cytometry—CD4 count and percentage
- HIV viral load and genotypic resistance test
- Tuberculin skin test (TST; consider a 2-step test) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA); see Tuberculosis. Either test may not perform as well in those with advanced HIV disease; in this setting, consider repeating the test after CD4 improves with antiretroviral therapy or consider empiric prophylaxis in individuals from high-risk endemic areas. Patients with a positive TST or IGRA or a history of TB exposure should have a chest x-ray to rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis
- Hepatitis A (IgG), hepatitis B (surface antigen [HBsAg], surface antibody [anti-HBs] and core antibody [anti-HBc total]) and hepatitis C (antibody [anti-HCV]) serology; see Viral Hepatitis, Acute
- Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) IgG
- Toxoplasma IgG serology if prophylaxis is being considered
- Syphilis serology
- Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea; biological females should be screened for trichomoniasis
- Pap test (cervical ± anal if available)
- Baseline laboratory investigations (prior to initiating drug therapy):

  - albumin
  - alkaline phosphatase
  - aminotransferases
  - bilirubin
  - serum creatinine, creatinine clearance
  - serum electrolytes
  - random or fasting lipid profile​[[4]](#c0102n00614)
  - random or fasting blood glucose​[[4]](#c0102n00614)
  - urinalysis
  - pregnancy test for individuals of childbearing potential
  - HLA B\*5701 test if considering abacavir
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) prior to treatment with oxidant medications, such as dapsone and primaquine

If a patient has symptoms of a specific opportunistic infection or epidemiologic risk factors (e.g., strongyloides), order appropriate investigations.

For asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mcL, some clinicians order a baseline serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), blood cultures for acid fast bacilli, and screening for CMV retinitis using Amsler grid testing or formal dilated ophthalmologic examination.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Advise PLWH who are immunosuppressed that their risk of infections can be reduced by following good hygienic practices:

- Ensure thorough handwashing after contact with potentially contaminated substances (diapers, soil, uncooked meat and produce) or handling pets and their feces
- Avoid raw or uncooked meat, fish and eggs, e.g., Caesar salad
- Drink from treated water sources only
- Avoid handling sick animals or pet litter (especially cat)
- Avoid cat or dog scratches and do not allow cats or dogs to lick wounds
- Avoid contact with reptiles
- Take appropriate precautions when travelling

### Pharmacologic Choices

Preventive interventions are outlined in [Table 1](#c0102n00015).

To improve immune function, consider starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) concurrently with therapy for OIs or within 2 weeks following the diagnosis of HIV, with the exception of cryptococcal meningitis and TB (if CD4 is >50 cells/mcL).​[[4]](#c0102n00614) Early ART initiation after cryptococcal meningitis decreases survival; delay starting ART for 2–10 weeks after initiation of cryptococcal therapy.​[[4]](#c0102n00614) In cases of advanced disease (CD4 <50 cells/mcL), ART may need to be initiated earlier, but would require monitoring for immune reconstitution syndrome and aggressive treatment if it occurs. See also [Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)](#c0102n00138) and HIV Infection: Treatment.

In patients who are not receiving ART at the time of tuberculosis therapy initiation and whose CD4 count is <50 cells/mcL, ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of therapy; if the CD4 count is >50 cells/mcL, ART should be initiated within 8 weeks.​[[4]](#c0102n00614) In the setting of other opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), early initiation of ART is associated with increased survival.

**Table 1:** Preventive Interventions for People Living with HIV​[[4]](#c0102n00614)[[6]](#c0102n00615)

| Indications | Condition | Prophylactic Therapy​[a]​[b] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independent of CD4 count | Routine immunizations | Update all vaccines (no live vaccines with the exception of MMR and varicella vaccines if CD4 ≥200 cells/mcL ). |
| CA-MRSA | Higher rates in MSM and those who use intravenous drugs. Consider screening swabs in patients with recurrent skin and soft tissue infections. For patients with recurrent MRSA infections, consider offering decolonization. |
| COVID-19 | Vaccination against COVID-19 (≥2 doses of an mRNA vaccine) is recommended for all PLWH . Individuals with untreated or advanced HIV (CD4 <200 cells/mcL or <15% ) who received a 2-dose series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should receive a third dose >28 days after the second dose. |
| Hepatitis | Hepatitis A vaccine for nonimmune individuals. Hepatitis B vaccine for nonimmune individuals. Consider 40 mcg dose (dialysis dose or double adult dose depending on preparation used) as the vaccine is less immunogenic in PLWH. Perform postimmunization serologic testing for hepatitis B (anti-HBs) 1–2 months after completion of the vaccine series. Repeat vaccination series if anti-HBs titre of >10 units/L not achieved. |
| Herpes simplex, frequent oral or genital outbreaks | Suppressive therapy with acyclovir , famciclovir or valacyclovir (see Table 4 ). |
| Herpes zoster (shingles) | Shingrix (Recombinant zoster vaccine, RZV) for patients ≥50 years of age, regardless of CD4 count. Two-dose schedule, with second dose 2–6 months after first dose. |
| Human papillomavirus (HPV) | Cervical Pap smear annually if the results are normal; refer patients with atypical squamous cells for colposcopy. Discuss anal cytology screening, if available, with MSM. HPV vaccine in patients 9–26 years of age. HPV vaccine for people aged 27 and older at ongoing risk should be considered. |
| Influenza | Annual influenza immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine preparation; live-attenuated influenza vaccine contraindicated. |
| Meningococcal disease | Meningococcal vaccine (conjugate, Men ACYW-135) is recommend in all PLWH , especially MSM and travellers to endemic or outbreak regions. Give 2 doses at least 8 wk apart and a booster dose every 5 y . Although vaccination to Meningococcal group B (Men B) is not routinely recommended, it can be considered in younger patients (16—23) or those at higher risk of infection such as those living in closed quarters like residence or barracks. |
| Mpox | Mpox pre-exposure prophylaxis should be offered to people with the highest potential for exposure. Two-dose primary series, 28 days apart. Booster dose 2 y after primary series. See mpox NACI guidance for updated recommendations.​ [7] Live vaccines are traditionally contraindicated for immunocompromised patients; however, NACI supports the safe use of Imvamune in immunocompromised patients, as it is considered a nonreplicating vaccine. |
| Pneumococcal infection | Conjugate pneumococcal vaccine 13-valent as the first dose, followed at least 8 wk later by the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine; repeat the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine once after 5 y. |
| Sexually transmitted infections ( STI s) | Patients on antiretroviral therapy can become infected with STI s including resistant HIV strains. Condom use is recommended for oral, anal and vaginal intercourse. Screen all patients at baseline for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis; biological females should be screened for trichomoniasis. Lymphogranuloma venereum, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, L2 and L3, has emerged as a cause of proctitis and/or femoral or inguinal lymphadenopathy in MSM . Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical syndrome in combination with nucleic acid amplification testing. Periodic follow-up screening for STI s depending on patient’s risk behaviours; syphilis screening recommended at least yearly for MSM. |
| Travel | Consultation with a travel medicine provider 4–6 wk before travel is advised. PLWH are at higher risk of developing severe malaria. Effective chemoprophylaxis and personal protection measures are essential. Prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil may be less effective in patients taking efavirenz- or PI-containing ART due to a drug interaction. |
| Varicella | Postexposure prophylaxis with IVIG for nonimmune patients. In VZV -seronegative persons with CD4 counts ≥200 cells/mcL, administer primary varicella vaccination (Varivax) in 2 doses 3 months apart Risks and benefits of live vaccines should be discussed with patient’s HIV specialist. |
| Positive PPD (≥5 mm) or IGRA , independent of CD4 count | Mycobacterium tuberculosis | Management of TB does not differ between PLWH and non-HIV positive patients; see Tuberculosis . Important to thoroughly review interactions with TB medications. |
| CD4 <200 cells/mcL | Pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) | The preferred prophylactic therapy is SMX/TMP (see Table 6 ). Alternatives include dapsone , atovaquone or monthly inhaled pentamidine (see Table 6 ). |
| Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive patients with CD4 count <100 cells/mcL | T. gondii encephalitis | The preferred prophylactic therapy is SMX/TMP (see Table 6 ). Atovaquone is an alternative (see Table 6 ). |
| CD4 <50 cells/mcL | Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) | Routine use of prophylactic therapy is no longer recommended for those who start ART immediately. For those who are not on fully suppressive ART, after ruling out active disseminated MAC disease, use a macrolide ( azithromycin once weekly or clarithromycin BID) (see Table 5 ). Rifabutin is an alternative (see Table 5 ). |
| Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) | Prophylaxis is not cost-effective; the focus of therapy is restoration of the immune system. |
| Fungal infections | Fluconazole may be used for persons with recurrent thrush or prior esophageal candidiasis (see Table 7 ). |

[a] For many vaccines, suppression of [HIV](#HumanImmunodeficiencyVirus-87003CEB) RNA by antiretroviral therapy is recognized as a factor to increased immunogenicity. In some settings, it may be prudent to delay or repeat immunization once this has occurred.

[b] In certain jurisdictions, some vaccines may not be publicly funded; however, they are still recommended (e.g., Shingrix); consult local public health.

### Discontinuation of Prophylaxis

Prophylaxis for some infections can be discontinued as the immune system recovers during antiretroviral therapy (see [Table 2](#c0102n00024)).​[[10]](#c0102n00251)​[[11]](#c0102n00253)​[[12]](#c0102n00254)​[[13]](#c0102n00255)​[[14]](#c0102n00257)

**Table 2:** Criteria for Discontinuing Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections in People Living with HIV​[[4]](#c0102n00614)

| Pathogen | Type of Prophylaxis​[a] | Criteria for Discontinuing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pneumocystis jirovecii | Primary and secondary | CD4 >200 cells/mcL × ≥3 months or can consider discontinuing when CD4 100–200 cells/mcL in those with a suppressed viral load for ≥3–6 months |
| Toxoplasma gondii | Primary | CD4 >200 cells/mcL × ≥3 months |
|  | Secondary | CD4 >200 cells/mcL × ≥6 months and asymptomatic of signs and symptoms of toxoplasmosis encephalitis |

| Cryptococcus neoformans | Secondary | 3 criteria for discontinuation: ≥1 year from initiation of antifungal therapy Patient is asymptomatic from cryptococcal infection CD4 ≥100 cells/mcL and suppressed viral load in response to antiretroviral therapy |

[a] Primary prophylaxis refers to the use of medications to prevent infection in a patient who is at risk for a disease, but does not have a history of infection with the disease.

Secondary prophylaxis refers to the use of medications to prevent recurrence of a disease in a patient who is at risk of relapse or reinfection of a disease.

### Clinical Syndromes

### Respiratory Tract Syndromes

Most upper respiratory tract symptoms are caused by viruses, but bacterial superinfections (otitis media, sinusitis) are more common in PLWH and require antibiotic treatment. Community-acquired pneumonia in patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/mcL can be treated in the same manner as for a patient without HIV infection (see Community-acquired Pneumonia). As the CD4 count declines to <200 cells/mcL, Pneumocystis jirovecii becomes an increasingly important pathogen. At counts <100 cells/mcL, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), CMV, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus spp. are more frequently isolated. Empiric treatment for PCP is often started in patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected (fever, dyspnea, chest x-ray findings). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum is often required to confirm the diagnosis and may reveal the presence of other opportunistic pathogens.

### Painful Mouth and Swallowing

Oral candidiasis is very common and occurs more frequently with CD4 counts <200 cells/mcL​[[15]](#IDSA2016Candidiasis). Diagnosis is based on clinical appearance (white curdy lesions on the buccal mucosa that scrape off) and not on the basis of isolation of Candida from the oral mucosa. Treatment with azole antifungal agents is usually very effective, but with prolonged use and repeated courses, especially in those with low CD4 counts, resistance can develop.​[[15]](#IDSA2016Candidiasis) Discrete painful ulcerative lesions are usually caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), CMV or aphthous ulcers. Patients with oral thrush and odynophagia are typically treated empirically for candida esophagitis. If they fail to improve after 1 week, endoscopy with cultures and biopsy should be done. Patients with esophageal candidiasis may require their medications to be crushed. Safe and appropriate crushing guidance may be found at the Toronto General Hospital [HIV/HCV Drug Therapy Guide](https://hivclinic.ca/main/drugs_extra_files/Crushing and Liquid ARV Formulations.pdf) and the University of Liverpool [HIV Drug Interactions](https://hiv-druginteractions.org/prescribing_resources/hiv-guidance-swallowing).

### Central Nervous System Symptoms

PLWH are at increased risk for opportunistic infections of the CNS, especially as their CD4 counts decline to <200 cells/mcL. At CD4 counts >200 cells/mcL, suspect the usual bacterial, mycobacterial (M. tuberculosis) and viral causes. Unusual causes of CNS infection, especially C. neoformans (meningitis) and Toxoplasma gondii (focal lesions) are disproportionately more common as the CD4 count falls to <200 cells/mcL (see [Figure 1](#c0102n00002)). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection caused by JC virus that can occur even at CD4 counts above >200 cells/mcL and for which there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment other than immune restoration with ART. HIV or CMV encephalopathy, as well as CNS lymphoma (likely Epstein-Barr virus–related), are also recognized in those with advanced HIV infection.

### Fever of Unknown Origin

Patients with low CD4 counts may present with fever and flulike symptoms but no specific focal symptoms to suggest a source. Possible infectious causes to be investigated include hepatitis viruses, sinusitis, MAC, M. tuberculosis, bartonellosis, CMV disease, Pneumocystis pneumonia (negative chest x-ray) and HIV viremia (see [Figure 1](#c0102n00002)).

### Diarrhea

Diarrhea is a very common symptom in PLWH, and infectious causes must be distinguished from noninfectious causes, including adverse drug effects. Acute bacterial gastroenteritis caused by the usual enteric bacterial pathogens may be more severe, may result in bacteremia and may require prolonged antibiotic treatment. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and hospitalization are risk factors for C. difficile infection, especially in patients with low CD4 counts. Chronic diarrheal syndromes in patients with CD4 counts <150 cells/mcL may be associated with MAC or parasitic infections including giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, cystoisosporiasis and microsporidiosis. As in people without HIV, viral gastroenteritis from pathogens such as norovirus should also be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea.

Patients (in particular MSM) may be colonized with the nonpathogenic amoeba Entamoeba dispar. Standard stool examinations for ova and parasites cannot differentiate this harmless commensal from the pathogenic E. histolytica. Polymerase chain reaction or enzyme immunoassay should be performed on a separate, fresh, unpreserved stool specimen to differentiate these organisms.

### Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

Patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, especially those with low initial CD4 counts, may experience worsening of opportunistic infections usually within 1–3 months as their CD4 count improves, despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment.​[[8]](#c0102n00249)​[[9]](#c0102n00250) The opportunistic infections most frequently encountered in this setting are mycobacterial (tuberculosis or MAC), cryptococcal and viral (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), although any opportunistic infection, as well as autoimmune conditions and malignancies, may be exacerbated by immune reconstitution. This phenomenon has been attributed to an enhanced inflammatory response at the site of infection and is usually self-limited but may be life-threatening. Both **combination antiretroviral therapy** and **antimicrobial treatment** are usually continued with the judicious use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in select individuals.

### Management of Specific HIV-Associated Infections​[[4]](#c0102n00614)​[[5]](#c0102n00452)

### Bartonellosis

Both Bartonella henselae and B. quintana can cause disseminated infection with lesions of bacillary angiomatosis in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mcL. Risk factors for B. henselae include cat scratches or contact with cats that have fleas. B. quintana is transmitted by body louse; risk factors include homelessness or unhygienic living conditions. Diagnosis is usually made using tissue biopsy or serologic testing; the organisms are fastidious and difficult to grow but can sometimes be recovered in blood. Consult local laboratory on advice for potential culture options. Preferred therapy is doxycycline; alternative agents include clarithromycin or azithromycin (see [Table 8](#c0102n00590)).

### Candida Species

The frequency of mucosal infection increases as the CD4 count decreases. Esophageal candidiasis is usually a later manifestation, but can occur in the absence of oral or vaginal disease. Severe discomfort or esophageal disease requires systemic therapy (see [Table 7](#c0102n00026)).

For oral thrush, fluconazole is the drug of choice in nonpregnant adults. Topical therapy may be used but is often less well tolerated and convenient. Examples of topical therapy include nystatin suspension (swish and swallow), miconazole tablets or clotrimazole vaginal tablets/suppositories as oral lozenges (see [Table 7](#c0102n00026)).​[[15]](#IDSA2016Candidiasis)

For vaginal candidiasis, topical azole antifungal creams or tablets/suppositories are first-line therapy (see [Table 7](#c0102n00026)). Fluconazole is the first-line choice oral systemic agent for vaginal candidiasis. Higher doses of fluconazole are used for esophageal disease for 14–21 days. IV amphotericin B, caspofungin or micafungin are reserved for patients who do not respond to oral therapy or who have fluconazole-resistant candida species. Amphotericin B lipid preparations are less toxic but more expensive than the conventional formulation and no more efficacious.​[[15]](#IDSA2016Candidiasis)

### Cryptococcus neoformans

C. neoformans usually occurs in patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mcL and is a major cause of meningitis in the later stages of HIV infection (10% of AIDS patients). The diagnosis requires culture of the organism or detection of cryptococcal antigen in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.

Induction therapy usually involves 2–6 weeks of IV amphotericin B with flucytosine, then completion of a minimum 8-week course of oral or IV fluconazole 400 mg/day (see [Table 7](#c0102n00026)).

Maintenance therapy consists of daily oral fluconazole for at least 12 months. Note that echinocandins such as caspofungin do not have activity against C. neoformans.

### Cytomegalovirus

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) usually occurs in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mcL. Retinitis with visual disturbances is the most common manifestation; however, enteritis, colitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, myelitis and/or neuritis can also occur. The prognosis is poor without therapy.

Cidofovir and foscarnet are reserved for cases of ganciclovir-resistant CMV; however, cross-resistance has been reported.

Induction therapy involves oral valganciclovir (a prodrug of ganciclovir), IV ganciclovir or IV foscarnet for 14–21 days (see [Table 9](#c0102n00336)).

Maintenance therapy involves daily administration of oral valganciclovir, IV foscarnet or IV cidofovir. IV foscarnet is approved in Canada for the treatment of CMV retinitis only but may be used off-label for ganciclovir resistant CMV. IV cidofovir and other foscarnet products are not licensed in Canada, can be difficult to obtain (available through [Canada’s Special Access Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/special-access/drugs/special-access-programme-drugs.html)), and are expensive and quite toxic.

### Herpes Simplex

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can occur in patients at any CD4 count. Typical manifestations include herpes labialis (cold sores) and genital herpes. HSV infection may cause proctitis in MSM with HIV infection. Diagnosis of herpes simplex is usually made by nucleic acid amplification of ulcerative mucocutaneous lesions.

Patients with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy during outbreaks or daily suppressive therapy. Acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir can all be used for treatment with a duration of 5–10 days for herpes labialis or a recurrence of genital herpes. Valacyclovir is often preferred due to decreased dosing frequency and improved oral bioavailability compared to acyclovir. Intravenous acyclovir is reserved for severe mucocutaneous disease, visceral involvement, encephalitis or retinitis. If mucocutaneous lesions fail to begin to resolve after 7–10 days of antiviral therapy, acyclovir resistance should be suspected and viral culture with susceptibility testing should be performed. The treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant HSV is IV foscarnet, with IV cidofovir as a potential alternative.

### Intestinal Protozoa

Intestinal protozoa can cause persistent, profuse, watery diarrhea in patients with CD4 counts <150 cells/mcL. Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium (protists related to fungi) can also involve the biliary tract. In addition, microsporidia can cause disseminated infection. These organisms may be foodborne, waterborne (the spores are often resistant to chlorination), zoonotic or transmitted from person to person. The mainstay of diagnosis is based on microscopic identification of oocysts or spores in stool samples. The laboratory should be notified that the patient is HIV-positive, as these organisms require special stains to be visualized and may be missed on routine ova and parasite examination. There are also ELISA methods for detection of cryptosporidium and giardia, as well as newer molecular methods to detect some of these protozoa.

The only consistently effective therapy is immune reconstitution with ART. Patients should be treated supportively with rehydration and electrolyte replacement, and antimotility agents may provide symptomatic relief. Adjunctive therapies with variable success include nitazoxanide and paromomycin for cryptosporidiosis, sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim for Cyclospora and Cystoisospora, and albendazole for certain species of microsporidia (see [Table 10](#c0102n00557)).

### Mycobacterium Avium Complex

MAC occurs in patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/mcL. Symptoms include fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats alone or with diarrhea, anemia, lymphadenopathy, and/or hepatitis. The diagnosis is made primarily by mycobacterial blood culture or biopsy, and culture of involved tissue.

Multidrug regimens are used to treat MAC (see [Table 5](#c0102n00331)), the basis of which is an oral macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) plus ethambutol. Additional drugs such as rifabutin (or rifampin), ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, or amikacin may also be used depending on the circumstances. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist would be suggested in complex clinical scenarios. Duration of induction therapy is 2–4 months, followed by maintenance therapy.

Maintenance therapy consisting of clarithromycin (or azithromycin) plus ethambutol with or without rifabutin is continued for life until a patient has sustained immune recovery on combination ART.

### Pneumocystis Pneumonia

Pneumocystis jirovecii is the primary cause of pneumonia in patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mcL. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) commonly presents as a persistent fever with progressive shortness of breath and cough. Although most present with diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray, the x-ray can be normal in those with early infection; CT scans are more sensitive and can be used when PCP is suspected in those with normal chest x-ray. The organism cannot be cultured. Definitive diagnosis requires visualization of the cystic or trophic forms in respiratory secretions using special stains. Some laboratories are using PCR to detect the pathogen, which, although more sensitive, may not differentiate colonization versus infection; verify with local laboratories on which methods are being used and how to interpret the results.

Treatment of choice is 21 days of oral or IV sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim (SMX/TMP, co-trimoxazole) (see [Table 6](#c0102n00332)). For severe disease in patients intolerant to SMX/TMP, IV pentamidine may be given for 21 days. Oral dapsone plus trimethoprim is better tolerated than SMX/TMP, but is suitable only for mild or moderate disease (there is no IV formulation). Other alternatives include oral atovaquone (for mild to moderate cases) and clindamycin plus primaquine. The G6PD level should be checked prior to therapy with primaquine or dapsone. In patients with severe PCP, the addition of oral prednisone decreases morbidity and the side effects of SMX/TMP (rash, hyperkalemia). Patients with PaO2 <70 mm Hg on room air or an alveolar-arterial O2 gradient >35 mm Hg should receive adjunctive prednisone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 20 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily to complete 21 days of treatment.

### Toxoplasma gondii

Up to 30% of PLWH with antibodies to this parasite will develop toxoplasma encephalitis when their CD4 cell count decreases to <100 cells/mcL. Patients most commonly present with a fever and focal neurologic signs. A CT scan with contrast or MRI usually reveals multiple intracranial-enhancing lesions.

Treat patients empirically. A marked clinical response usually occurs within 7 days; if there is no response, refer to a specialty centre. First-line therapy in Canada is oral or IV high-dose **SMX/TMP** (see [Table 6](#c0102n00332)). An alternative is atovaquone. Patients with perilesional edema require dexamethasone.

Standard therapy has traditionally been pyrimethamine plus leucovorin and sulfadiazine given for 4–8 weeks followed by chronic maintenance therapy; however, pyrimethamine is not available in Canada and sulfadiazine is available only through Canada’s Special Access Program.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Prevention and Management of Opportunistic Infections

Prior to a planned pregnancy and during pregnancy, treat the patient with combination ART to ensure an undetectable viral load. This will prevent many of the serious opportunistic infections. The criteria for discontinuing prophylaxis for opportunistic infections also apply in pregnancy (see [Table 2](#c0102n00024)).

During pregnancy, sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim can be given to prevent PCP and toxoplasmosis, although risk versus benefit needs to be assessed in the first trimester.​[[4]](#c0102n00614) Initiate treatment for PCP with SMX/TMP in any trimester (see [Table 3](#c0102n00469)). Folic acid supplementation is suggested for all pregnant patients and is especially important to prevent congenital abnormalities that can occur with SMX/TMP use in the first trimester. The dosing of folic acid ranges from 0.4–5 mg/day depending on the clinical history; see Folic Acid. Preferred agents for MAC and mucocutaneous candidiasis are azithromycin and topical antifungals, respectively. For less common opportunistic infections, consult a reference such as the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV​[[4]](#c0102n00614) for specific regimens approved for use in pregnancy.

In the postpartum period, the usual preventive and therapeutic regimens can be reintroduced if the patient is not breastfeeding. If the patient is breastfeeding, each medication must be assessed for exposure in breast milk.​[[16]](#c0102n00624) Consultation with a pharmacist is recommended.

### Therapeutic Tips

- All practitioners caring for PLWH should be aware of and participate in preventive interventions for OI.
- Treatment of OI requires specialized expertise and should be done in centres experienced with the management of PLWH.
- Consult with pharmacists when using therapy for OI in combination with ART, given the potential for drug interactions. Useful tools for management of drug interactions commonly encountered with HIV-related medications are the [University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interactions website](https://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/checker) and Toronto General Hospital’s [drug interaction tables](https://hivclinic.ca/drug-information/drug-interaction-tables/).
- Patients who are adherent to antiretroviral therapy with sustained virologic suppression and restoration of cellular immunity are at very low risk of OIs, with a rate similar to the HIV seronegative population. Therefore, empiric therapy for OIs in an individual with well-controlled HIV is generally not indicated.
- Interruptions in antiretroviral therapy are to be avoided when at all possible, and patients should be educated on the risk of the development of resistance if HIV therapy is stopped and started or if adherence to treatment is poor.
