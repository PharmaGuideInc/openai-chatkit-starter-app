### Pathophysiology

Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, is a common symptom usually associated with salivary hypofunction resulting in reduced quantity or altered quality of saliva. It has been estimated that a 50% reduction in salivary secretion needs to occur before xerostomia becomes apparent;​[[1]](#psc1195n1001) however, xerostomia and hyposalivation are not synonymous, since xerostomia (a subjective feeling) may exist in the presence of normal salivary flow (an objective measure) and some patients may not complain of xerostomia even in the presence of demonstrated hyposalivation. Xerostomia affects about 1 in every 4–5 adults. It can occur at any age but is more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age, affecting 25% of women and 16% of men.​[[2]](#psc1195n1002) Rates in institutionalized elderly people may be as high as 50%.​[[3]](#psc1195n1003)

Xerostomia is not a disease, but a manifestation secondary to a medical condition, a medication or radiation therapy:​[[4]](#psc1195n1004)

- *Medical conditions*: Systemic conditions that can cause xerostomia are listed in [Table 1](#psc1195n00002).
- *Medications*: One of the more common causes of xerostomia (especially in the elderly) is medications. Drugs that cause significant dry mouth in more than 10% of patients are listed in [Table 2](#psc1195n00007). The drug effects on quantity and quality of saliva are generally not permanent.
- *Radiation therapy*: Following radiation to the salivary glands (head and neck area) in cancer patients, the degree of permanent xerostomia depends on the volume of salivary glands included in the fields of radiation and the total radiation dose. Radiation causes a change to secretory cells resulting in a reduction of salivary output and increased viscosity of the saliva.​[[5]](#psc1195n01036)​[[12]](#psc1195n1005)

The risk of dry mouth may be increased by smoking or chewing tobacco and the intake of caffeine-containing beverages.​[[13]](#psc1195n01034)

Saliva has various protective functions, which include maintaining the neutral pH of the mouth, promoting remineralization of teeth, coating the teeth and lubricating the oral mucosa, providing local antimicrobial activity, and assisting in the taste mechanism.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) The loss of the protective functions of saliva can affect all of the mouth’s functions and may increase the risk of developing *Candida* infection and dental caries.​[[15]](#psc1195n1014) It can also lead to a lack of efficacy of certain medications (e.g., sublingual nitroglycerin or lorazepam). [Table 3](#psc1195n00008) lists potential complications of dry mouth that may affect a person’s general well-being and quality of life.​[[2]](#psc1195n1002)

**Table 3:** Potential Complications of Dry Mouth

| Avoidance of some foods that are difficult to chew and swallow Decreased ability to chew and swallow Decreased nutritional status Impaired ability or willingness to talk Increased dental caries | Increase in oral ulceration Inhibition of taste sensation Oral infections, e.g., candidiasis, gingivitis Tooth loss Wearing dentures becomes uncomfortable or impossible |

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms and improve mouth comfort
- Prevent complications of dry mouth such as dental caries, poor nutrition, fungal infection

### Patient Assessment

Patients may have differing perceptions of whether or not their mouths are dry. Some have sufficient saliva flow, but complain of dry mouth. Others have true xerostomia, yet do not recognize that their mouth is dry. Encourage patients to conduct a daily mouth examination and check for any red or white patches, ulcers, or tooth decay. If anything unusual is found, or if patients are complaining of dry mouth, further assessment is warranted to find the underlying cause. [Figure 1](#psc1195n00009) outlines the assessment of patients with dry mouth.

Consider xerostomia if a patient is having difficulty eating dry foods such as crackers​[[4]](#psc1195n1004) or if lipstick adheres to the front teeth when worn.​[[16]](#psc1195n1015) On examination, the mucosa may be dry and sticky, with the saliva appearing stringy or foamy. Dental caries may be found at the cervical margin (neck of teeth) or incisal margins (the tips) of the teeth.​[[4]](#psc1195n1004) The mucosa may appear erythematous due to overgrowth of Candida albicans, with patches commonly affecting the hard or soft palate and dorsal surface of the tongue.

Difficulty eating (e.g., mouth feels dry while eating, patient has difficulty swallowing food and needs to sip water to swallow dry food) is suggestive of salivary hypofunction as the cause of dry mouth.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) The continuous presence of dry mouth symptoms during the day is associated with more significant salivary hypofunction than if there is gradual onset of symptoms over the course of the day. Symptoms of dry mouth that occur only at night are usually not associated with salivary hypofunction because salivary function normally approaches zero during sleep.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) Sleep apnea, nasal congestion and breathing through one’s mouth may cause exacerbation of nighttime symptoms of dry mouth.

Patients may experience regional or generalized mucosal pain, often described as “burning,” or they may describe the inability to eat acidic or spicy foods, leading them to make changes to their diet.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) This can be suggestive of chronic atrophic candidiasis, secondary to dry mouth. Patients with chronic atrophic candidiasis frequently also have angular cheilitis, seen as “cracks” in the corners of the mouth. Such patients require formal diagnosis and treatment and appropriate referral is recommended (see Oral Candidiasis).

Assess the ability of patients with dry mouth to swallow solid dosage forms of medications and assist in exploring alternative options.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Whenever possible, treatment should be directed toward the underlying cause of dry mouth; however, since most systemic conditions causing dry mouth are not curable, management of dry mouth is usually directed toward controlling symptoms and preventing or treating complications. Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to avoid medications that can cause dry mouth (see [Table 2](#psc1195n00007)).

Some non-pharmacological management measures patients can follow include:

- Avoiding or cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine (such as coffee, tea and cola). Caffeine causes the mouth to become drier.
- Not using tobacco, cannabis or alcohol. They can cause dry mouth.
- Sipping water often during the day.
- Sucking on ice chips.
- Chewing sugar-free gum or sucking on sugar-free candy during the day. This will help keep the mouth moist and won’t cause cavities.
- Using a humidifier or vaporizer to help keep the air moist.

### Dental Care

Patients with xerostomia should be informed that they are at increased risk of dental caries because of their decreased saliva.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) Advise regular brushing and flossing and regularly scheduled examinations by a dentist and dental hygienist. The use of fluoride toothpastes or rinses is encouraged. Remind patients to avoid sugary or acidic foods or beverages to help prevent dental caries.

### Salivary Flow Stimulation

If the patient’s salivary glands are still functioning, physiologic stimulation of saliva flow can be accomplished through masticatory or gustatory stimuli.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) Encourage patients to chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candies as needed throughout the day. These substances are sweetened using an alcohol sugar (e.g., xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, lactitol or erythritol) and do not promote dental caries.​[[17]](#psc1195n1016) Labels should be carefully read to ensure the product does not contain simple sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, maltose) as these are cariogenic.​[[17]](#psc1195n1016)

### Water Consumption

Water intake is important for general good health; however, patients should not assume that drinking large volumes of water will overcome oral dryness unless xerostomia is due to dehydration. Taking frequent small sips of water during the day and sucking on ice chips will help relieve oral symptoms; however, frequent intake of water at night may lead to nocturia and interrupted sleep. Lemon juice should be avoided since it depletes the salivary glands of saliva and may erode tooth enamel.​[[18]](#psc1195n1017)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription product, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Mouth Products: Dry Mouth. [Table 4](#dt1) outlines the pharmacologic therapies for dry mouth.

### Saliva Substitutes

Artificial saliva products can help to replace moisture and lubricate the mouth. They are formulated to mimic natural saliva, but not to stimulate salivary gland production.​[[19]](#psc1195n1018) Artificial saliva substitutes cannot replace all the functions of saliva and their action is short-lived due to swallowing.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006)​[[20]](#psc1195n1019) Use has not been shown to prevent caries or oral candidiasis; therefore, they must be considered as replacement therapy rather than a cure.​[[2]](#psc1195n1002)​[[14]](#psc1195n1006) These products come in a variety of formulations including solutions, sprays and gels and are convenient for patients to use while talking and to prevent nocturia from increased fluid intake during the night. They are most useful when used immediately before speaking or before bedtime.​[[21]](#psc1195n1020) There are limited data to suggest superiority of any of the products; therefore, selection should be based on availability and personal preference.​[[21]](#psc1195n1020) [Table 4](#dt1) outlines the saliva substitutes available to manage dry mouth.

**Moi-Stir** contains electrolytes normally present in saliva, including the chloride salts of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, as well as sodium phosphate dibasic.

**Mouth Kote** is a mouth moisturizer composed of yerba santa, water, xylitol, sorbitol and citric acid. Yerba santa (*Eriodictyon californicum*) is said to have expectorant properties and is used as a flavouring agent.​[[22]](#psc1195n1021)

**Biotene Dry Mouth Moisturizing Mouthwash**, **Moisturizing Spray** and **Oralbalance Moisturizing Gel** contain humectants and lubricants to help moisturize and lubricate the mouth; glycerin is the main moisturizing ingredient. In a 2018 study of patients with medication-induced subjective xerostomia, combined use of the mouthwash and gel provided relief of symptoms and improved oral-health related quality of life.​[[23]](#Barbe2018)

### Sialogogues

Anethole trithione stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and increases the secretion of acetylcholine. While it has been used for many years in the treatment of chronic xerostomia, reports differ as to its efficacy. Further research is needed to establish its safety and efficacy for this indication.​[[24]](#psc1195n1031)​[[25]](#psc1195n1032)

Another sialogogue is the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine.​[[14]](#psc1195n1006)​[[26]](#psc1195n1027) It stimulates the exocrine glands with a duration action of 3–5 hours.​[[27]](#psc1195n1028) The lowest effective and tolerated dose should be used for maintenance therapy. Salivary secretion is maximally stimulated approximately 1 hour after administration of pilocarpine. No tolerance to the secretagogue effect of pilocarpine has been reported, nor has long-term improvement in baseline salivary function been found. Increased salivary output is transient, dose-related and consistent.​[[28]](#psc1195n1029) Pilocarpine is effective in patients with Sjögren syndrome and in those who develop xerostomia while receiving radiation therapy for head or neck cancer.​[[28]](#psc1195n1029) Pilocarpine administered as a mouthwash, by diluting pilocarpine eye drops in water to make a 1–2% pilocarpine solution, has been used effectively to increase salivary flow without any systemic side effects.​[[29]](#psc1195n1030) Its use to treat medication-induced xerostomia is not a Health Canada–approved indication. Use of pilocarpine is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma or when miosis is undesirable (e.g., acute iritis, angle-closure glaucoma).​[[21]](#psc1195n1020) [Table 4](#dt1) outlines the sialogogues available to manage dry mouth.

### Dental Care

The use of fluoride is critical to prevent dental caries in patients with xerostomia. It is applied professionally by the dentist or hygienist and maintained by the patient through daily use of high fluoride–containing toothpastes (e.g., Prevident) or mouth rinses (e.g., Oral B Fluoride 0.05%, alcohol-free). Sodium fluoride rinses 0.05% used twice daily have been effective in preventing demineralization of enamel in patients with xerostomia while receiving radiation therapy.​[[30]](#psc1195n1033) Patients should avoid use of commercial mouth rinses containing alcohol since alcohol has a drying effect on the oral mucosa.​[[21]](#psc1195n1020)

For cracked lips that may be sore, suggest using **petroleum jelly**.​[[18]](#psc1195n1017)

### Monitoring of Therapy

Reassess patients advised to practise appropriate self-care for dry mouth after 1 week. If they are achieving improved mouth comfort through increased intake of fluids and use of sugarless candy and are practising good dental hygiene, encourage them to continue these measures. Encourage them to seek the advice of a dentist on the care of their teeth and for evaluation of the cause of their dry mouth when appropriate. Evaluate patient acceptance of a saliva substitute (taste, dosage form, degree of comfort attained). Advise patients who are not achieving mouth comfort with one product to try another.​[[20]](#psc1195n1019) If mouth complications arise (e.g., oral candidiasis) or the dryness worsens, further evaluation by a health-care practitioner is necessary.

If pilocarpine has been prescribed, monitor the patient for excessive cholinergic side effects such as sweating and flushing. If no improvement in mouth discomfort is noted after 1 week of use, dosage adjustment may be necessary.
