### Introduction

Most children are successfully toilet trained by around 3 years of age, with a wide range of 0.75–5.25 years of age; girls are usually trained earlier than boys.​[[1]](#c0052n00018) Daytime incontinence in children is defined as the repeated daytime voiding of urine into clothes at least twice per week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child ≥5 years of age.​[[2]](#c0052n00017)

Daytime incontinence occurs in about 10% of children 4–6 years of age, declining to 4% in adolescents. Girls are affected twice as often as boys. It is considered a problem in a child ≥4 years of age who wets daily (primary) or who relapses after 6 consecutive months without daytime wetting (secondary). Possible functional or organic causes of daytime incontinence are listed in [Table 1](#c0052n00005).

**Table 1:** Possible Causes of Daytime Incontinence

| Functional | Functional constipation (as defined by the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders;​ [3] ​ [4] see Constipation in Children ) Deferral of voiding (“holding it in until the last minute”) Fusion of labia minora Urinary tract infection Urge syndrome (unstable bladder; sudden attacks of uncontrollable urge to void; characteristic squatting to avoid detrusor contractions) Stress incontinence Giggle incontinence Emotional stress Daytime frequency syndrome​ [a] |
| Organic | Neurogenic bladder Partial urethral obstruction, e.g., posterior urethral valve, congenital strictures Ectopic ureter |

[a] Sudden onset of frequent daytime urination of small amounts in a previously toilet trained child.​[[5]](#Cohen1993)

Enuresis is bedwetting during sleep (even nap time), more than twice weekly beyond 5 years of age for girls and 6 years of age for boys. In primary enuresis, bladder control has never been achieved and in secondary enuresis, loss of bladder control occurs after at least 6 months without bedwetting.​[[6]](#c0052n00019) Primary enuresis, which is more common in boys, occurs in 10–15% of 5-year-olds and 6–8% of 8-year-olds and declines to <2% by 15 years of age.​[[7]](#c0052n00090)

There are 2 subtypes of primary enuresis: volume-dependent enuresis (associated with nocturnal polyuria; a normal nocturnal rise in antidiuretic hormone [ADH] secretion may not occur in these children) and detrusor-dependent enuresis (associated with daytime frequency, urgency or incontinence).​[[8]](#c0052n00020) Enuresis occurring in the absence of any other medical, urological or neurological condition is referred to as monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Possible causes of enuresis are listed in [Table 2](#n00100) and include developmental delay (immaturity of CNS control over bladder contractions and/or responsiveness to bladder filling), genetics (molecular linkage to chromosome 8q, 12q, 13q) and obstructive sleep apnea.​[[9]](#c0052n00021)​[[10]](#c0052n00022)

Given the association of sleep disorder, breathing and enuresis, studies have shown that having an adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy has a positive impact on the resolution of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.​[[11]](#Jeyakumar2012)

Enuresis has been reclassified into monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic. The latter term is reserved for children who have any of the following daytime lower urinary tract symptoms in addition to bedwetting: daytime incontinence, urgency, volume difficulties, abnormally low or high daytime volume frequency, i.e., <4 or >7 times per day.​[[12]](#Neveus2020)

**Table 2:** Possible Causes of Enuresis

| Primary | Idiopathic Disorder of sleep arousal | Nocturnal polyuria Small bladder capacity |
| Secondary | Dysfunctional voiding Cystitis Diabetes mellitus | Diabetes insipidus Psychological Obstructive sleep apnea |

There is no evidence that enuresis is associated with any specific behavioural or psychological problems, yet most affected children are clearly distressed by their condition. The caregivers’ supportive role in treatment is crucial; an intolerant attitude on the part of the caregivers predicts early dropout from treatment.​[[13]](#c0052n00024) [Table 3](#table-1639-9DC48C0A) provides possible interpretations of bedwetting history.​[[14]](#refitem-1152110-9DBAB04C)

**Table 3:** Possible Interpretations of Bedwetting History

| Findings from history | Possible interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Large volume of urine in the first few hours of night | Typical pattern for bedwetting only |
| Variable volume of urine, often more than once a night | Typical pattern for children and young people who have bedwetting and daytime symptoms with possible underlying overactive bladder |
| Bedwetting every night | Severe bedwetting, which is less likely to resolve spontaneously than infrequent bedwetting |
| Previously dry for >6 months | Bedwetting is defined as secondary |
| Daytime frequency/urgency/wetting; abdominal straining or poor urinary stream; pain passing urine | Any of these may indicate the presence of a bladder disorder such as an overactive bladder or, more rarely (when symptoms are severe and persistent), an underlying urological disease |
| Constipation | A common comorbidity that can cause bedwetting and requires treatment |
| Soiling | Frequent soiling is usually secondary to underlying fecal impaction and constipation, which may have been unrecognized |
| Inadequate fluid intake | May mask an underlying bladder problem, such as overactive bladder disorder, and may impede the development of an adequate bladder capacity |
| Behavioural and emotional problems | These may be a cause or a consequence of bedwetting; treatment may need to be tailored to the specific requirements of each child or young person and family |
| Family problems | A difficult or stressful environment may be a trigger for bedwetting; these factors should be addressed alongside the management of bedwetting |
| Practical issues | Easy access to a toilet at night, sharing a bedroom or bed, and proximity of caregivers to provide support are important issues to take into account and address when considering treatment, especially with an alarm |

### Goals of Therapy

- Identify and/or manage serious causes of urinary incontinence
- Decrease the number of incontinence episodes per unit of time (day, week)
- Provide reassurance and guidance to both the child and caregiver

### Investigations

- History with attention to:

  - family history of urinary incontinence (often present in enuresis)
  - bowel function; constipation is frequently associated with urinary incontinence that is due to decreased bladder capacity
  - pattern of wetting
  - history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) or urologic surgery
  - psychological status of child and family dynamics
- Physical examination with attention to:

  - perineal sensation, perineal reflexes, sphincter tone (to rule out neurogenic bladder)
  - genitalia, particularly the urethral meatus (to rule out anatomical causes such as meatal stenosis in boys or labial fusion in girls)
  - possible occult spinal dysraphism such as tethered cord (congenital spinal cord abnormality that can cause progressive neurologic damage); signs include the presence of a hair tuft, dimple, pigmented lesion or subcutaneous lipoma over the lower spine, or asymmetry of the gluteal cleft (refer to pediatric neurosurgeon)
  - direct observation of voiding, if possible, to rule out abnormalities of urinary stream
- Other investigations as indicated:

  - diary to record voiding pattern and/or bowel movements
  - urinalysis and urine culture; no other investigations are necessary for primary enuresis
  - voiding cystourethrogram (to detect vesicoureteral reflux, partial urethral obstruction or neurogenic bladder) as well as ultrasound of kidneys and bladder are recommended if history of UTIs
  - if voiding cystourethrogram is abnormal, referral to a urologist is indicated​[[6]](#c0052n00019)

### Therapeutic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0052n00004) depicts the management of urinary incontinence in children. Without treatment, 15% of affected children are expected to become dry each year. Tailor therapy to etiologic factors. Combinations of different interventions may be useful.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- In cases of daytime incontinence and nocturnal enuresis, advise caregivers to refrain from humiliating or punishing the child and to support the child’s efforts with positive reinforcement, e.g., reassurance, diary of dry days, facilitated access to bathroom at home and school.
- Have the child avoid excessive intake of fluids within 2 hours of bedtime and empty the bladder before going to bed.
- Encourage the child to avoid deferral of micturition.
- Encourage bladder training exercises for daytime incontinence, e.g., scheduled voiding routine, abdominal or pelvic floor muscle exercises.
- Enuresis alarms may reduce the average number of wet nights a week compared with control or no treatment.​[[15]](#c0052n00051)​[[16]](#Baird2021) Enuresis alarms, which are highly sensitive to moisture, attach to underpants or an absorbent pad and either vibrate or produce sound at the first sign of voiding. Because children with enuresis are usually deep sleepers, the caregiver must often be the one to wake the child when the alarm sounds. The child then completes voiding in the toilet and returns to sleep after changing the underwear or bedding. Alarm therapy is usually more effective in children with a normal urine output and a small or normal bladder capacity.​[[17]](#c0052n00052)​[[18]](#c0052n00088) Enuresis alarms are inexpensive relative to medications and may be purchased at medical supply stores or online. Alarms may be tried in motivated and committed patients as young as 5 years of age with consistent family involvement and support. Best results may be achieved in children ≥7 years of age. Relapse rates were lower when dry bed training (following a strict schedule for waking the child up at night until he or she learns to wake up alone when needed) or overlearning (child drinks 4–6 oz. of water in the hour before going to bed while continuing to use the alarm) were added to alarm treatment.​[[7]](#c0052n00090)​[[15]](#c0052n00051)​[[19]](#c0052n00089)
- There is no evidence of effectiveness for complementary therapies such as hypnosis, chiropractic, faradization (electric shock to the genital area) or homeopathy.​[[20]](#c0052n00080)
- There is some evidence that transcutaneous parasacral electrical nerve stimulation, functional magnetic stimulation,​[[21]](#refitem-1162116-9DC9CCB2) laser acupuncture​[[22]](#refitem-1162117-9DC9CF14) or limiting milk intake to avoid hypercalciuria​[[23]](#refitem-1162118-9DC9D139) may improve response and decrease relapse.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 4](#c0052n00009) lists medications used in the management of urinary incontinence in children ≥5 years of age.

### Antidiuretic Hormone Analogues

Desmopressin, an analogue of human antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreases urine production when given at bedtime and reduces the number of wet nights in 75% of children, with complete cessation in about 50% of those who respond.​[[24]](#c0052n00053) Desmopressin is used when a rapid response is required. If successful, consider a 1-week interruption every 3 months to see if treatment is no longer needed.​[[25]](#c0052n00054) Desmopressin may be most effective in older children with a normal bladder capacity but with a large urine output.​[[18]](#c0052n00088)​[[25]](#c0052n00054)​[[26]](#c0052n00056)​[[27]](#refitem-1162122-9DCBBBAB) Patients with high urine output and reduced bladder capacity may require combination treatment with desmopressin and a smooth muscle relaxant. If cost is a concern, reserve desmopressin for special occasions such as overnight visits or camp. The antidiuretic effect of desmopressin may result in overhydration and hyponatremia, which may result in seizures and death. The risk of hyponatremia necessitates limiting fluid intake 1 hour before and 8 hours after taking desmopressin and holding the dose during illnesses that may cause a fluid or electrolyte imbalance, e.g., fever, vomiting, diarrhea.​[[28]](#c0052n00079) Caregivers should be advised to discontinue desmopressin and seek immediate medical attention if the child develops prodromal symptoms of hyponatremia (headache, nausea, vomiting).​[[29]](#HealthCanadaSafetyDesmopressin)

Health Canada issued a safety alert advising that all *intranasal* formulations of desmopressin are contraindicated for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis. Compared with oral formulations, intranasal formulations are associated with a higher incidence of hyponatremia; they remain indicated for patients with central diabetes insipidus.​[[29]](#HealthCanadaSafetyDesmopressin)

### Anticholinergic Smooth Muscle Relaxants

The anticholinergic smooth muscle relaxants include oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin and propiverine. Oxybutynin is useful for reducing bladder contractions in children with detrusor overactivity (e.g., urge syndrome or neurogenic bladder). Data on the efficacy of oxybutynin in children is limited. An observational study of 81 children with daytime incontinence who were treated with oxybutynin for ≥3 months found 38% of patients were completely dry, 31% had significant improvement and 23.5% had slight improvement. The most common side effects experienced were constipation, dry mouth and flushing.​[[30]](#VanArendonk2006) While not indicated for use in children in Canada, tolterodine and solifenacin are selective antimuscarinic agents that have been shown to improve symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) in children with fewer systemic adverse events than nonselective agents. A retrospective analysis of 256 children with OAB who were treated with tolterodine for a mean of 9 months found a decrease of 68% in the number of incontinence episodes​[[31]](#Raes2004) and a systematic review concluded tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin and better tolerated for the treatment of urinary incontinence in children.​[[32]](#Medhi2013) A randomized, controlled trial of 189 children with OAB found solifenacin increased mean volume voided/micturition (MVV) at 12 weeks compared with placebo but did not differ with respect to the number of daily voids or incontinence episodes. It was well-tolerated with minimal anticholinergic side effects.​[[33]](#Newgreen2017)​[[34]](#Afshar2021) An extension of this study through 52 weeks found efficacy (increased MVV) and tolerability were maintained.​[[35]](#Newgreen2017EXT) Tolterodine and solifenacin are generally reserved for cases in which oxybutynin is not tolerated. Oxybutynin and tolterodine are both available as immediate- and extended-release formulations, with the extended-release demonstrating greater efficacy in urinary incontinence.​[[36]](#Reinberg2003)​[[37]](#VanArendonk2006IRvER) Propiverine is used for urinary incontinence and/or increased frequency and urgency of overactive bladder. A retrospective review of children with overactive bladder found voiding frequency decreased from 14 to 8.5 voids/day with propiverine.​[[38]](#Kim2012)

Combination therapy of desmopressin plus an anticholinergic is generally reserved for refractory cases.​[[39]](#c0052n00059) A combination of desmopressin and oxybutynin can be tried in children with both detrusor overactivity and increased urine production.​[[40]](#c0052n00060) A combination of extended-release tolterodine and desmopressin has also been shown to be effective in cases when desmopressin monotherapy has failed.​[[41]](#c0052n00069) A lower dose of oral desmopressin (200 mcg tablets or 120 mcg melts) is required when used in combination.

### Other Therapies

Low-quality evidence suggests that, compared with placebo, the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, desipramine and imipramine reduce the number of wet nights (1 fewer bedwetting episode per week) and allow more children to successfully achieve 14 consecutive dry nights;​[[42]](#CaldwellPHSureshkumarPWongWC.Tricyc-E0AF8EF1) however, these agents are not generally recommended because of their adverse effects (e.g., dizziness, GI discomfort, headache, mood changes), narrow therapeutic window and high relapse rate after therapy cessation.​[[42]](#CaldwellPHSureshkumarPWongWC.Tricyc-E0AF8EF1) Tricyclic antidepressants may be considered by a health-care practitioner with expertise in the management of bedwetting if the child has failed to respond to all other treatments.​[[43]](#c0052n00081)

### Treatment of Relapse

Treatment relapse is defined as >1 symptom recurrence per month.​[[44]](#Austin2016) If relapse occurs following treatment with either desmopressin or an enuresis alarm, combination therapy with desmopressin and an alarm may be effective.​[[15]](#c0052n00051)​[[45]](#Song2019)

Enuresis is considered refractory when there is no response to desmopressin (at maximum dosage), alarm therapy, or a combination of desmopressin and alarm. In these cases, further investigation is required to assess for proper use of the enuresis alarm or the presence of overactive bladder, occult constipation, sleep apnea, or social/emotional causes.​[[12]](#Neveus2020)​[[46]](#Caldwell2018) Management is dependent upon the results of the investigations.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Predictors of positive treatment outcome include a motivated child, supportive family and age over 10 years.
- Predictors of treatment failure include developmental delay, low self-esteem, a history of behaviour problems or multiple wettings at night, frequent daytime voiding, intolerance or annoyance by caregiver, and unstable family dynamics.​[[47]](#c0052n00062)
- The cause of most cases of daytime incontinence is uncovered by noninvasive investigations (history, physical exam, urinalysis, urine culture, and ultrasound of kidney and bladder).
- Relative to desmopressin, enuresis alarms are superior in that once the child achieves dryness, there is less chance of relapse.​[[15]](#c0052n00051) The effects of desmopressin are immediate, whereas enuresis alarms take longer to reduce frequency of bedwetting.
