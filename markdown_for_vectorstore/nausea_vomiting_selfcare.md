### Introduction

Nausea is a symptom (not a diagnosis) that refers to the unpleasant sensation of the imminent need to vomit. Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents with contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Nausea and vomiting may be transient symptoms secondary to a self-limited condition such as viral gastroenteritis or part of more complex medical issues. The underlying cause should be determined when possible. Approaches to treatment are dependent on the associated risk factors and diagnosis, which may include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV); or metabolic, GI, vestibular or neurologic causes, such as motion sickness.​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)

This chapter addresses the management of general nausea and vomiting. The management of cancer chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting is addressed in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy. The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is addressed in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

Causes of nausea include:

- Neurologic/vestibular conditions: stroke, increased intracranial pressure, migraine, neoplasm, pain, head injury, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, motion sickness
- Drugs/toxins: alcohol, antibiotics, bacterial food poisoning, cannabis, chemotherapy, hormones, opioids, NSAIDs, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, digoxin, benzodiazepines, SSRIs, noxious odours, anesthesia, radiation therapy, or medication initiation, withdrawal or toxicity
- GI conditions: viral gastroenteritis, constipation, diseases of the liver (including hepatitis), cholecystitis, pancreatitis, chronic idiopathic nausea, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome, nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux, GI motility disorders
- Psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, fear, grief, eating disorders, functional nausea, anticipatory nausea (situations in which patients are conditioned by previous experience of nausea and vomiting, e.g., chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting)
- Medical conditions: Addison disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, hormonal effects of pregnancy, severe heart failure, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, malignancy (including metastasis), myocardial infarction, uremia, acute infections

Complications of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting include esophageal rupture, Mallory-Weiss tears, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, malnutrition, and dental caries.

### Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is complicated by the involvement of numerous neurotransmitters and nerve systems arising from different organs and activated by a variety of stimuli (see [Figure 1](#psc1030n00002)).​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)​[[2]](#psc1030n00043)​[[3]](#psc1030n00044) Because of this, it is often difficult to determine which stimulus is most responsible for a patient’s symptoms and to design a therapeutic plan.

### Motion Sickness

Motion sickness refers to the normal physiologic response to unusual perception of motion.​[[4]](#psc1030n00045) It can be precipitated by abrupt changes in movement, such as during bumpy rides, turbulent flights and rough seas, and is also referred to as carsickness, airsickness or seasickness. The development of motion sickness depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the stimulus (frequency, intensity, direction and duration) as well as individual susceptibilities including age and gender.​[[4]](#psc1030n00045)​[[5]](#psc1030n00046)​[[6]](#psc1030n00047) Women are more prone to developing motion sickness than men. Susceptibility to motion sickness is highest between 3 and 12 years of age and gradually decreases thereafter. Children under 2 years of age are typically immune to motion sickness. Motion sickness begins with a feeling of “stomach awareness,” followed by nausea, increasing malaise, pallor and sweating. As symptoms worsen, patients may also experience increased salivation, a feeling of body warmth, dizziness, and vomiting or retching.​[[4]](#psc1030n00045)​[[5]](#psc1030n00046)​[[6]](#psc1030n00047) The severity of symptoms varies with the intensity of the stimulus and the susceptibility of the individual.

Theories as to the cause of motion sickness centre around a mismatch between the motion one expects to occur (either through visual cues or previous experiences) and the actual motion sensed by the vestibular apparatus in the ear.​[[4]](#psc1030n00045)​[[6]](#psc1030n00047) The vertical component of the motion is believed to be most important in causing motion sickness, and the movement must be repetitive, relatively slow and prolonged.​[[4]](#psc1030n00045) This may explain why ship travel, characterized by low-frequency continuous oscillation, is such a potent cause of motion sickness, while travelling in a speedboat is not.

Neurotransmitters thought to be most responsible for motion sickness include histamine and acetylcholine. Drugs used for treatment are aimed at modulating receptors for these chemicals.

### Drug-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Almost all drugs are capable of producing nausea and, to a lesser degree, vomiting. Some of the most commonly used and/or emetogenic nonchemotherapy drugs are listed in [Table 1](#psc1030n00036). A thorough discussion of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy agents is available in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting.

The mechanisms by which some drugs cause nausea and vomiting are unknown but likely involve extensions of their pharmacologic action. Drugs that cause vomiting by acting on the area postrema include dopaminergic agonists (e.g., levodopa), nicotine, digoxin and opioid analgesics. Agents such as NSAIDs and erythromycin activate peripheral afferent pathways, most likely vagal, which then stimulate the brainstem nuclei to coordinate the act of vomiting. This chapter specifically addresses cannabis and opioid analgesics.

Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome:​[[7]](#Coyle2019)​[[8]](#Attout2020)

- Mechanism not completely understood but is associated with long-term cannabis use.
- Diagnostic features include severe cyclic nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain (epigastric and periumbilical location), relief of symptoms with hot showers or baths, and resolution with cessation of cannabis.
- Cessation of cannabis is the most effective treatment with complete resolution of symptoms within 7–10 days.
- Provide counselling to patients in a nonjudgmental way to build trust and the need to discontinue cannabis use.

Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting:​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)​[[9]](#psc1030n00064)​[[10]](#psc1030n00063)

- Approximately 25–30% of patients started on opioids experience nausea.
- Nausea and vomiting are most common during the first few days of therapy and tolerance develops rapidly thereafter.
- There is little evidence of differences between opioids in their propensity to cause nausea and vomiting. Rather, the increase in the dose of opioid raises the risk of nausea and vomiting.
- Opioids may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating afferent input into the vomiting centre via the vestibular apparatus, the cerebral cortex or the chemoreceptor trigger zone.

**Table 1:** Selected Drugs Associated with Nausea and Vomiting

| Antibiotics: Antituberculous agents Azithromycin Cephalexin Clarithromycin Erythromycin Metronidazole Sulfonamides Tetracycline | Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin Valproic acid Antidiabetics: Metformin Sulfonylureas | Anti-inflammatories: ASA Auranofin Colchicine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Cardiovascular: Amiodarone Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Digoxin Procainamide | Others: Acyclovir Cannabis Levodopa Nicotine Opioids Oral contraceptives Theophylline |

### Goals of Therapy

- Eliminate nausea and vomiting or reduce its severity, frequency and duration to a level acceptable to the patient (nausea can be more distressing to some patients than actual vomiting and interferes significantly with quality of life)
- Correct any consequences of persistent nausea (with or without vomiting) such as electrolyte abnormalities or nutritional compromise
- Prevent complications of nausea and vomiting
- Prevent recurrence of nausea and vomiting
- Decrease time off work and lifestyle disruptions caused by nausea and vomiting

### Patient Assessment

History:

- ascertain the frequency and severity of nausea as well as the timing in relation to meals, time of day, emotion or stress
- clarify the relationship between nausea and vomiting; if vomiting occurs, determine the amount and nature of the vomitus
- in all women of reproductive age, inquire about last menstrual period to rule out pregnancy
- explore possible underlying causes
- inquire about diet history including any new foods, food allergies or intolerances, and if potentially contaminated food has been consumed
- establish any exposure to, or other symptoms of, infection such as gastroenteritis or exposure to others who are ill
- obtain a thorough medication history including use of prescription, nonprescription, herbal or recreational drugs (including cannabis) as well as alcohol, nutritional supplements and vitamins
- inquire about recent changes to drug regimens (dosage increases or withdrawal) and correlation with nausea

Physical examination:

- determine severity and consequences of symptoms—assess hydration including skin and mucous membranes

[Table 2](#RedFlags) details red flags to consider when assessing a patient with nausea and vomiting.​[[11]](#2013Anderson) [Table 3](#psc1030n00038) presents signs and symptoms of dehydration.​[[12]](#psc1030n00066)​[[13]](#psc1030n00067) In adults, a dry axilla supports hypovolemia while moist mucous membranes are not consistent with hypovolemia. Assessment of skin turgor does not have proven diagnostic value for hypovolemia in adults.​[[14]](#McGee1999) [Figure 2](#psc1030n00011) depicts decreased skin turgor. [Figure 3](#psc1030n00006) presents an approach to patient assessment for nausea and vomiting.​[[15]](#psc1030n00065)

**Table 2:** Red Flags ​[[11]](#2013Anderson)

| Dehydration (see Table 3 ) | Blood in vomit (red or coffee grounds appearance) | Unintended weight loss |
| Persistent vomiting | Blood in stool (red or black, tarry stool) | Altered mental status |
| Abdominal pain | Difficulty swallowing | Age >55 y |

**Table 3:** Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration in Children and Adults​[[12]](#psc1030n00066)[[13]](#psc1030n00067)

| Children | Adults |
| --- | --- |
| Dry mouth, tongue and skin | Increased thirst |
| Few or no tears when crying | Decreased urination |
| Decreased urination (<4 wet diapers in 24 h) | Feeling weak, dizzy or light-headed |
| Sunken eyes | Dry mouth/tongue |
| Sunken soft spot (fontanel) in infants | Dry axilla |
| Decreased skin turgor (see Figure 2 ) |  |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

To manage nausea and vomiting through general nonpharmacologic measures:​[[11]](#2013Anderson)

- Ensure adequate hydration (PO or IV if appropriate)
- Advise patients to avoid smells and foods that cause nausea
- Recommend consumption of frequent small meals and snacks rather than large meals at infrequent intervals
- Suggest dietary interventions that may help with nausea associated with certain food intolerances; consult a dietitian when necessary
- Suggest relaxation therapy and cognitive behavioural therapies that may be useful in the treatment of nausea associated with irritable bowel syndrome and anticipatory nausea​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)
- Treat pain if nausea and pain coexist; successful treatment often reduces the nausea
- Engage patient in the decisions around treatment. Not every patient will want treatment; watchful waiting is an alternative for these individuals
- Reassure patient when underlying cause is self-limited

To prevent motion sickness, counsel patients to:​[[16]](#Brainard2014)

- Avoid eating a large meal within 3 hours of travel
- Avoid dairy products and foods high in protein, calories or sodium before travel
- Avoid alcohol, smoking and disagreeable odours during travel
- Increase ventilation and exposure to cool fresh air
- Minimize head movement by pressing head into headrest
- Avoid visual stimuli that commonly precipitate motion sickness, such as reading or watching videos during travel
- Focus on a stable external object or the horizon during travel
- Stay in a central location while on a boat, which is the least susceptible to motion
- Sit in the front seat of a vehicle with a clear forward view and, if possible, drive the vehicle rather than be a passenger

Acupressure wristbands (Sea-Bands) have not been shown to be beneficial for preventing motion sickness. In a controlled study of experimental motion sickness, neither acupressure nor acustimulation were of benefit;​[[17]](#psc1030n00070) however, a systematic review found no difference between antiemetic drugs and stimulation of the PC6 acupoint on the wrist in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.​[[18]](#Lee2015)

Aromatherapy with inhaled isopropyl alcohol pads (held 1–2 cm below the nostrils) has been shown to be more effective than placebo​[[19]](#Beadle2016) or ondansetron​[[20]](#April2018) in reducing nausea symptoms within 30 minutes postintervention in adults in the emergency department.

Maintaining fluid intake helps prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. The amount of fluid required depends on the amount lost through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Adults require 1–3 L of total water intake to maintain normal hydration status.​[[12]](#psc1030n00066) In patients who are vomiting several times daily, additional fluid intake may be needed. For mild dehydration, drinking adequate amounts of water may be all that is required. To treat moderate to severe dehydration, it is necessary to replace electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium). Oral rehydration solutions with appropriate amounts of electrolytes are recommended under these circumstances.​[[13]](#psc1030n00067)

### Pharmacologic Choices

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Selected agents used in the management of nausea and vomiting are described in [Table 5](#c0111n00014).​[[21]](#psc1030n00083)​[[22]](#psc1030n00084) For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

When selecting a drug, consider whether the nausea is acute or chronic, review concurrent medications, and attempt to identify the underlying cause of nausea (see [Figure 3](#psc1030n00006)). A preventive approach may be appropriate in certain situations, for example, in the management of motion sickness. Many patients cannot tolerate oral medications when nauseated, and alternative routes of administration (IM, IV, SC, rectal or transdermal) may be more suitable.

For treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with viral gastroenteritis, there is no evidence that one antiemetic is superior to another. The initial choice should be made on the basis of previous response, available routes of administration, cost, adverse effects and patient preference. These criteria often result in diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate being tried first. Dimenhydrinate consists of 2 drugs (diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline) and must be metabolized to its active ingredient, diphenhydramine, resulting in a slower onset of action.​[[23]](#PharmacologyText2019)

If symptoms are worsened by movement, it may be surmised that acetylcholine is a significant contributor, and anticholinergic agents such as first generation antihistamines, e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate or hydroxyzine, may be tried first. If symptoms are associated with a feeling of fullness in the stomach, a prokinetic agent such as metoclopramide or domperidone may be a logical starting point. Caution is warranted with these agents since domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death​[[24]](#HealthCanadaDomperidone) and metoclopramide is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (even in children) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw). If patients fail to respond to these initial measures, base selection of other antiemetics on adverse effects, available routes of administration, patient preference and cost. Consider trying agents with different mechanisms of action if combinations of antiemetics are to be used.

### Motion Sickness

Since acetylcholine and histamine are thought to be the most important neurotransmitters causing motion sickness, it follows that anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs are fairly effective in controlling it. Prevention is more effective than treatment in established nausea and vomiting.

- For short duration of exposure, diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate are effective for most patients. Because motion sickness induces gut stasis, it is important to take oral medications at least 60 minutes in advance of travel.​[[5]](#psc1030n00046)​[[6]](#psc1030n00047)
- Scopolamine transdermal patch applied at least 4 hours before exposure is effective and the duration of action is up to 3 days.​[[25]](#psc1030n00086)
- Promethazine has a longer duration of action as compared with dimenhydrinate and may be an alternative in patients with refractory nausea or when dimenhydrinate is ineffective.
- If alertness is required, transdermal scopolamine or oral promethazine may be combined with dextroamphetamine or ephedrine.​[[25]](#psc1030n00086)​[[26]](#psc1030n00087) These combinations have been used in extreme situations (e.g., by airline pilots) after the patient has become thoroughly accustomed to the CNS effects of these drugs, as they may be unpredictable.​[[27]](#psc1030n00088)
- The most appropriate agent for children older than 2 years of age is dimenhydrinate given 1 hour before exposure, then every 6 hours as needed. Some children experience paradoxical excitability, so a test dose should be administered well before travelling.​[[28]](#2007CPSAirTravel)
- Controlled clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated the benefit of ginger **root** for motion sickness, although it is widely promoted for its antinausea effects.​[[29]](#2013Palatty23638927)

### Opioid-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Therapeutic options for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting include the following:

- Alter the administration schedule so that nausea does not interfere with meals.
- Reduce the dose of the opioid as low as possible or avoid large increases in the opioid dose since this may lead to comparatively large increases in the opioid’s serum concentrations, which may in turn induce or worsen nausea and vomiting.
- If pain is not controlled, attempt an increase in dosage since nausea is sometimes caused by pain.
- Consider switching to another opioid at 75% of the equivalent daily dose. No solid evidence for differences between opioids exists in terms of emetogenicity, but patient responses are highly variable.​[[9]](#psc1030n00064)
- Addition of an antiemetic drug is often helpful, although the possibility of additive CNS side effects must be carefully weighed. Appropriate antiemetic agents include diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, haloperidol and ondansetron.​[[9]](#psc1030n00064)​[[10]](#psc1030n00063)
- When managing refractory opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, instead of replacing one antiemetic agent with another, adding additional therapies with different mechanisms of action may result in a synergistic effect.
- Tolerance to nausea and vomiting frequently develops in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. However, changes to the opioid drug therapy regimen should be made as part of a team approach, closely involving the patient’s other health-care practitioners.

### Monitoring of Therapy

Monitoring of therapy involves paying close attention to the patient’s description of the nausea response and to changes in frequency of vomiting, and vigilantly monitoring for emergence of serious complications such as weight loss, dehydration, change in mental status (which may signal electrolyte disturbances) and blood loss from any source. Assess adherence to nonpharmacologic measures when response to therapy is suboptimal (see [Table 4](#psc1030n00022)).

[Table 5](#c0111n00014) shows the most common adverse effects encountered with the antiemetic agents discussed. If a patient experiences an intolerable adverse effect, consider reducing the dosage, switching to another agent or relying on nondrug measures alone.

**Table 4:** Monitoring of Therapy for Nausea and Vomiting

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion sickness | Patient: whenever exposed to stimulus Health-care practitioner: after next visit | Minimal/no nausea. No vomiting. | Depending on the drug being used, increase dosage or switch to another agent; ensure dose given approximately 60 min before stimulus. |
| Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting | Patient: continuously Health-care practitioner: daily or as often as is practical | Minimal/no nausea. No vomiting. | If dimenhydrinate ineffective, try alternative agents and/or adjust opioid dosage. |
| Symptoms of dehydration (see Table 3 ) | Patient: continuously Health-care practitioner: daily or as often as is practical | No symptoms of dehydration. | If symptoms of dehydration occur, immediately evaluate further. |

### Advice for the Patient

Advise all patients with nausea and vomiting regarding:

- When medical attention should be sought (warning signs include symptoms of dehydration such as dizziness and sunken eyes, severe abdominal pain, blood in vomitus, repeated vomiting, and inability to keep liquids down for >8 h)
- Nonpharmacologic measures to improve nausea and vomiting, tailored to the specific cause of their nausea
- The optimal timing of drug therapy for motion sickness; medications should be taken 1 hour before travel
- Possible adverse effects of drug therapy, especially sedation, which may preclude performing activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery
- The risk of combining antiemetic medications with alcohol
- The importance of handwashing after handling the scopolamine patch, as severe eye irritation or mydriasis can occur if the eyes are touched
