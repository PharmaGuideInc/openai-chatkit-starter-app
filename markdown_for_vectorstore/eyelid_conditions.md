### Eye Anatomy

Eyelids and lashes protect the globe (eyeball) from foreign bodies and injuries and help maintain a wet corneal surface. The eyelid is a complex structure of skin, muscle and fibrous tissue. The skin of the eyelid is among the thinnest anywhere on the body, which allows for mobility of the eyelids. Underneath the skin lies loose, areolar tissue that is capable of significant edema and swelling. The next layer is the orbicularis oculi muscle, responsible for closing the eyelids and innervated by the seventh cranial nerve.​[[1]](#psc1014n1001)​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)

Posteriorly in the eyelid is the tarsus, a dense fibrous connective tissue plate that supports the lid margins and forms the skeleton of the eyelid (see [Figure 1](#psc1014n00001)). Modified sebaceous glands, known as meibomian glands, are contained within the tarsal plates and secrete the lipid layer of the tear film. There are 20–30 glands in the upper lid and 10–20 in the lower lid.​[[1]](#psc1014n1001)​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)

The glands of Zeis and Moll lie in the anterior section of the eyelid. Zeis glands are modified sebaceous glands that are associated with the lash follicles. Moll glands are modified sweat glands whose ducts open either into a lash follicle or directly onto the anterior lid margin between the lashes (see [Figure 2](#psc1014n01024)).​[[4]](#psc1014n1004)

This review will focus on some of the most common eyelid conditions: stye, chalazion and blepharitis. See [Table 1](#E8C7EFF9) for a brief review of these eyelid conditions. For a more detailed review of each eyelid condition, see each appropriate section.

**Table 1:** Key Differences Among Common Eyelid Conditions​[[5]](#McAlindenCCongazles-AndradesMSkiada-E8CC5F03)[[6]](#CarlisleRTDigiovanniJ.DifferentialD-E8CCBA8E)

| Eyelid Condition | Description | Signs and Symptoms | Onset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stye | Acute infection of 1 or more eyelid glands (meibomian, Zeis or Moll) | Unilateral painful lesion, localized lid swelling, tenderness, erythema | Acute (days) |
| Chalazion | Sterile, focal, chronic inflammation of the lid due to obstructed meibomian gland | Non-tender (painless), rubbery nodule, localized lid swelling, often unilateral | Gradual enlargement (days to weeks) |
| Blepharitis | Chronic inflammation of the lid margins associated with infection, dermatological conditions or meibomian gland dysfunction | Irritated, possibly reddened lid margins; greasy, scaly and/or flaky; usually bilateral | Gradual irritation (weeks to months) |

### Stye (Hordeolum)

### Pathophysiology

For a brief comparison of common eyelid conditions, see [Table 1](#E8C7EFF9). A stye (hordeolum) is a bacterial infection of the eyelid glands. It is the most common eyelid infection.​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)​[[7]](#psc1014n1005)​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) The most common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus; cultures are seldom required since treatment mainly involves drainage of the lesion. When the glands of Zeis or Moll are involved, the infection is smaller, more superficial and referred to as an external stye. In this type of infection, the lesion always points toward the skin. An internal stye is marked by a larger area of swelling that usually involves the meibomian glands; the lesion can point either to the skin or to the conjunctival surface. As compared with the external stye, the internal stye generally has a more prolonged course. Styes are associated with blepharitis and acne rosacea and have a tendency to recur.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[7]](#psc1014n1005)

### Goals of Therapy

- Resolve infection
- Prevent recurrence
- Prevent transmission to other eye or to household contacts

### Prevention

A common-sense approach to avoid infecting the fellow eye or transmitting the infection to other persons in the household includes the following patient instructions:

- Avoid touching the eyes; wash the hands after any contact with the infected eye.
- Change compresses, towels and pillowcases after each use.
- Do not share makeup with others.
- Do not wear makeup or contact lenses until the stye resolves.
- Replace eye makeup, contact lenses and contact lens case after stye resolves.
- Do not allow the tip of eye drop bottles or ophthalmic ointments to touch the eye or eyelashes. If this occurs, discard them due to contamination.

Conscientious attention to treating symptoms of blepharitis may help to decrease the incidence of recurrent styes (see [Blepharitis](#psc1014n01044)).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

External styes usually drain spontaneously within 48 hours, but warm compresses applied for 10–15 minutes 3 or 4 times a day may hasten resolution.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)​[[10]](#psc1014n1008) Following the application of warm compresses, gently massaging the eyelid toward the lid margin can also be helpful. Warm tap water is sufficient to use in compresses. There is a risk of burning the skin when using the microwave to heat warm compresses.​[[11]](#psc1014n01078) One study showed that a hard-boiled egg, kept in the shell, retained heat longer than a warm compress.​[[12]](#psc1014n1009) The authors suggest that a hard-boiled egg wrapped in a handkerchief or compress is a convenient and cost-effective way to apply heat to the eyelid. The same egg can be reboiled prior to each application. Other alternatives to a compress are commercially available seed- or bead-filled eye masks (Magic Bag, Bruder eye compress, Eyegiene). Caution patients against applying pressure on the warm compress or hard-boiled egg, as corneal deformation can occur resulting in blurred vision (usually transient following short-term use).​[[13]](#psc1014n01079)​[[14]](#psc1014n01080) If patients find it difficult to control the amount of pressure using the hard-boiled egg, they may try bending forward and holding the wrapped egg close to the eye without touching it.​[[13]](#psc1014n01079)

Once the stye drains, remove the excess discharge by cleaning the eyelid with warm water and a face towel, eyelid wipes, or a cotton swab/facecloth dipped in diluted baby shampoo. Patients should seek medical advice if they have external styes that do not spontaneously drain within 48 hours. In these situations, incision and drainage may be required.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)​[[10]](#psc1014n1008)​[[15]](#DeibelJPCowlingK.OcularInflammation-A468CF7C)

Acute internal styes generally resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks. Warm compresses applied for 10–15 minutes 3 or 4 times a day can be used, although there are no clinical trials that demonstrate effectiveness of non-surgical interventions, including compresses, for acute internal styes.​[[16]](#LindsleyKNicholsJJDickersinK.Non-su-E8CED082) Patients should seek medical advice if they have internal styes that do not resolve in 1 week.​[[15]](#DeibelJPCowlingK.OcularInflammation-A468CF7C)​[[16]](#LindsleyKNicholsJJDickersinK.Non-su-E8CED082)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Self-medication with nonprescription ophthalmic antibacterials is not necessary and is not recommended, since the majority of styes drain spontaneously.​[[17]](#psc1014n1010)

If incision and drainage are required, an ophthalmic antibacterial ointment such as erythromycin, applied to the conjunctival sac several times a day, is common practice to prevent further infection.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)​[[10]](#psc1014n1008) An ophthalmic solution containing neomycin, polymyxin B and gramicidin failed to demonstrate a significant benefit after incision and drainage of a stye in a randomized controlled trial.​[[18]](#HirunwiwatkulPWachirasereechaiK.Eff-EAE6438B)

Occasionally, infection from styes may spread locally, resulting in preseptal cellulitis. This presents as generalized swelling and redness of the eyelids as opposed to a localized lesion, and requires assessment by an ophthalmologist and systemic antibacterials.​[[5]](#McAlindenCCongazles-AndradesMSkiada-E8CC5F03)

. . . . .

### Chalazion

### Pathophysiology

For a brief comparison of common eyelid conditions, see [Table 1](#E8C7EFF9). A chalazion is an idiopathic, sterile, chronic inflammation of a meibomian gland. Blockage of the meibomian gland orifices results in stagnation of sebaceous secretions.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[10]](#psc1014n1008)​[[19]](#psc1014n1013) A lesion develops over a period of weeks and is characterized by painless, localized swelling. Most chalazia point toward the conjunctival surface, causing conjunctival redness and swelling.

Chalazia are more common in people with blepharitis, acne rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis. These patients are also at greater risk of developing multiple or recurrent chalazia. Patients with recurrent or persistent chalazia require evaluation for more serious conditions such as meibomian gland carcinoma. Other potential risk factors identified for chalazia include smoking, gastritis and irritable bowel syndrome.​[[20]](#psc1014n01082)

The initial symptoms of a chalazion (localized eyelid swelling, red lesion/nodule) may resemble a stye without the acute inflammatory signs (pain, tenderness).​[[1]](#psc1014n1001)​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[19]](#psc1014n1013) Chalazia may be distinguished from styes by the lack of pain.​[[21]](#psc1014n01083) A large chalazion may press on the eyeball and cause astigmatism or visual distortion.

### Goals of Therapy

- Resolve lesion
- Prevent recurrence

### Patient Assessment

For a brief comparison of common eyelid conditions, see [Table 1](#E8C7EFF9).

An algorithm for the assessment of eye conditions is presented in [Figure 3](#figure-6DBC4BA6).

### Prevention

Encourage patients who have recurrent chalazia associated with blepharitis to maintain good lid hygiene (see Blepharitis, [Nonpharmacologic Therapy](#psc1014n01051)). Advise patients with dermatologic conditions such as acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis to adhere to treatment of these conditions. Adherence to treatment regimens will decrease the likelihood of blocking the meibomian glands and exacerbating chalazia. Encourage and support smoking cessation (see Smoking Cessation).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Initial treatment for a chalazion is similar to that for a stye, especially for small lesions.​[[19]](#psc1014n1013)​[[22]](#psc1014n1016)​[[23]](#psc1014n1017) Warm compresses, applied several times a day, are used to soften sebaceous secretions that may be blocking meibomian gland orifices. Approximately 25–50% of lesions resolve with this treatment. Following the application of warm compresses, gentle massage of the eyelid toward the lid margin may also be helpful. Once the chalazion drains, remove the excess discharge by cleaning the eyelid with warm water and a face towel, eyelid wipes, or a cotton swab and diluted baby shampoo.

Further assessment is required if the lesion does not begin to resolve within a few days of initiating warm compress treatment. Immediate referral to an appropriate health-care practitioner is required for patients experiencing eye pain or impaired vision.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Since chalazia are not the result of an infectious process, self-medication with nonprescription ophthalmic antibacterials is not recommended.​[[1]](#psc1014n1001)​[[19]](#psc1014n1013)​[[21]](#psc1014n01083)

Larger chalazia may require surgical excision, intralesional steroid injections or both.​[[19]](#psc1014n1013)​[[22]](#psc1014n1016)​[[23]](#psc1014n1017) These procedures should be performed by an ophthalmologist. When excision is required, the ophthalmologist makes a vertical incision on the conjunctival surface, followed by careful curettement of the gelatinous material; a biopsy may be required to rule out malignancy with recurrent chalazia. Topical antibacterials or corticosteroid drops may be prescribed after surgery to prevent infection and decrease inflammation. The presence of cellulitis is an indication for the use of systemic antibacterials.

. . . . .

### Blepharitis

### Pathophysiology

Blepharitis is a chronic condition, with periods of exacerbation, that usually affects the eyelids bilaterally.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) It is often associated with chronic dermatologic conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis,​[[24]](#psc1014n01084) as well as dry eye, contact lens associated–giant papillary conjunctivitis, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, gastritis and isotretinoin therapy.​[[25]](#psc1014n01085)​[[26]](#AmescuaGAkpekEFaridMEtAl.Blephariti-EEAEF705) For optimal control of blepharitis, these conditions must also be treated.

Parasite infestations may also contribute to blepharitis. The presence of *Demodex* mites has been associated with both anterior and posterior blepharitis.​[[27]](#DuncanKJengBH.MedicalManagementOfBl-EC76AD2F)​[[28]](#PutnamCM.DiagnosisAndManagementOfBl-EC76AF3C)​[[29]](#HossainPKonstantopoulosA.Blephariti-EC76B0C9) These parasites inhibit hair follicles and sebaceous glands, causing obstruction and increasing eyelid inflammation. The incidence of *Demodex* infestation increases with age. *Phthirus pubis* (crab lice) is less commonly found, but can be involved in the more acute forms of blepharitis. For more information on the treatment of lice, see Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies.

Long-term complications of this chronic disorder include physical damage to the eyelids and the cornea.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Inflammation of the cornea can result in scarring, loss of surface smoothness and loss of visual acuity. If the inflammation is severe, corneal perforation may occur.

Blepharitis can be classified as either anterior or posterior, depending on the part of the eyelid that is affected (see [Figure 2](#psc1014n01024)). However, most patients present with a combination of anterior and posterior blepharitis, making it difficult to accurately diagnose and treat. For a brief comparison of anterior and posterior blepharitis, see [Table 2](#F567B38D).

### Anterior Blepharitis

Anterior blepharitis may be generally classified as staphylococcal or seborrheic. Although 2 types of anterior blepharitis have been identified, it is more common for patients to present with a mix of staphylococcal and seborrheic types.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Patients with either form of anterior blepharitis are also predisposed to developing conjunctivitis.

Staphylococcal blepharitis is usually caused by S. aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Patients present with inflammation and erythema along the anterior margin of the eyelid. The lid margins are scaly, with crusts and tiny ulcerations around the lashes. In chronic inflammatory staphylococcal blepharitis, loss of eyelashes (madarosis) may occur. Complications of staphylococcal blepharitis include recurrent styes or chalazia, epithelial keratitis of the lower third of the cornea, and marginal corneal infiltrates.

Seborrheic blepharitis (nonulcerative) presents with less inflammation and redness along the anterior border of the eyelid and the scales are more oily or greasy than in staphylococcal blepharitis.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Seborrheic blepharitis is often associated with seborrheic dermatitis affecting other parts of the body.

### Posterior Blepharitis

Meibomian gland dysfunction can lead to inflammation of the posterior aspect of the eyelid (closer to the eyeball).​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) This is a bilateral, chronic condition that sometimes coexists with anterior blepharitis. Meibomian gland dysfunction can present as either meibomian seborrhea or meibomianitis.

Meibomian seborrhea is characterized by excessive glandular secretions.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Symptoms can include photophobia, burning sensation, an excessively oily or foamy tear film, and froth on the lid margin. Although they may be difficult to detect, small oil globules may be sitting at the meibomian gland orifices on the lid margin. There are usually few signs of inflammation.

Meibomianitis is characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the meibomian glands.​[[2]](#psc1014n1002)​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[9]](#psc1014n1007) Signs include diffuse or localized inflammation of the posterior lid margin. In chronic cases, the meibomian gland orifices become obstructed and the posterior lid margin may become thick, rounded and notched. When pressure is applied over the glands, a soft cheesy substance is expressed. In very severe cases, the glands are completely blocked so no secretions can be expressed.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce inflammation and discomfort associated with blepharitis
- Reduce risk of recurrence of severe symptoms
- Reduce risk of complications such as conjunctivitis and keratitis

### Patient Assessment

Generally, symptoms of blepharitis include irritation, photophobia, burning and itching of the lid margins, crust on the eyelashes, and eyelid sticking. There may also be a foreign-body sensation in the eyes.​[[9]](#psc1014n1007)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[31]](#psc1014n1015) Patients may complain of a sandy or gritty sensation in the eyes that is worse upon awakening since, during sleep, the inflamed eyelids lie against the cornea, tear secretion decreases and inflammatory mediators have several hours to act on the surface of the eye. Severe cases may present with eyelash loss and eyelid scarring.​[[26]](#AmescuaGAkpekEFaridMEtAl.Blephariti-EEAEF705)

If symptoms worsen in the evening, dry eye disease may be a more likely diagnosis.​[[26]](#AmescuaGAkpekEFaridMEtAl.Blephariti-EEAEF705) Since meibomian gland dysfunction can decrease the lipid layer of the tear film, blepharitis often coexists with dry eye disease.​[[6]](#CarlisleRTDigiovanniJ.DifferentialD-E8CCBA8E) See Dry Eye for more information.

In addition to an assessment of their symptoms, patients would also benefit from an examination by an eye-care professional using slit-lamp biomicroscopy to evaluate tear film, anterior lid margin, eyelashes, posterior lid margin, tarsal conjunctiva, bulbar conjunctiva and the cornea.​[[1]](#psc1014n1001)

### Prevention

Blepharitis is a chronic condition that frustrates patients, physicians and eye-care practitioners. Inadequate instruction and nonadherence with lid hygiene are the most common reasons for treatment failure.​[[10]](#psc1014n1008) Encourage patients to maintain a long-term lid hygiene program, as this helps prevent exacerbations and long-term complications. Treatment of dermatologic disorders elsewhere in the body, such as seborrheic dermatitis, is important in achieving long-term control of blepharitis.​[[7]](#psc1014n1005)​[[17]](#psc1014n1010)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Ophthalmic Products: Cleansers and Washes.

Treatment for all types of blepharitis consists of regular and long-term eyelid margin hygiene:​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[31]](#psc1014n1015)​[[33]](#psc1014n1011)

1. Warm compresses, applied to closed eyelids for 5–10 minutes, help to melt solidified material in the glands. There are commercially available products (e.g., Eyegiene) that maintain a temperature of 43°C for 10 minutes to provide optimal softening of meibomian gland secretions.
2. Gentle cleansing of the lid margin: instruct the patient to gently scrub only the lid margin, not the conjunctiva or outer lid area, using either warm water with a facecloth, a cotton swab/facecloth dipped in a solution of baby shampoo diluted with warm water, or commercial eyelid wipes.
3. The patient may be instructed to perform firm massage of the lid margins after applying warm compresses to enhance secretion from the meibomian glands. One hand holds the eyelid taut at the outer corner, while the index finger of the other hand presses along the lid from the inner corner out. Alternatively, the patient may simply apply direct pressure to the lid if that is more comfortable. Mechanical expression performed by an ophthalmologist may be necessary to decrease the amount of irritating lipids within the glands.
4. Artificial tears may help to alleviate symptoms, especially in patients with associated dry eye disease. For more information, see Dry Eye.

Lid hygiene is required 2–3 times daily immediately after initial diagnosis or during periods of exacerbation, but may be reduced to twice a week once control has been achieved.​[[8]](#psc1014n1006)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[33]](#psc1014n1011) This decision should be made by the treating health-care practitioner. Very few patients will be able to completely discontinue a lid hygiene regimen.

If blepharitis persists despite adherence to eyelid margin hygiene, consider assessing whether the patient used a lid hygiene product containing cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB). CAPB is a surfactant present in many cosmetic and self-care products, including baby shampoo and eyelid scrub products, that is known to cause contact dermatitis and eyelid dermatitis.​[[34]](#WellingJDMaugerTFSchoenfieldLRHende-A4736071) Recalcitrant blepharitis has been associated with the use of products containing CAPB. Eyelid cleansers containing hypochlorous acid 0.01% are antimicrobial and effective in the eradication of S. epidermidis strains on the skin surrounding the eye.​[[35]](#StromanDEtAl.ReductionInBacterialLo-EEB1AFCA) These products are not available in Canada.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

### Antibacterials

Treatment of anterior blepharitis may include ophthalmic antistaphylococcal antibiotics used after eyelid cleansing.​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[31]](#psc1014n1015) Antibacterial ophthalmic ointments are preferred to drops because of increased contact time between the drug and tissues. The ophthalmic ointment may be applied externally on the eyelid margins by wiping across the closed eyelid near the lashes with a clean fingertip or cotton swab. The ointment may be instilled inside the conjunctival sac for more severe blepharitis or for overnight use. An ointment that covers staphylococcus, such as erythromycin, is recommended. Although appropriate, ophthalmic bacitracin is not available in Canada as of March 2019. See [Table 4](#TopicalAntimicrobialsBlepharitis) for more information on topical antibacterial options.

In posterior blepharitis, due to significant meibomian gland dysfunction and subsequent ocular surface disease, patients may require systemic antibacterial therapy for several weeks, in addition to lid hygiene.​[[28]](#PutnamCM.DiagnosisAndManagementOfBl-EC76AF3C)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[31]](#psc1014n1015)​[[32]](#WladisEJBradleyEABilykJRYenMTMawnLA-EE8891F8) Tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline or minocycline) are usually the drugs of choice. Erythromycin is an alternative when tetracyclines are contraindicated (e.g., allergy or during pregnancy). Azithromycin can be used as pulse therapy for the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction because of its long half-life.​[[36]](#GreeneJBJengBHFintelmannREMargolisT-A471B4C5)​[[37]](#IgamiTZHozchuhROsakiTHSantoRMKara-J-A471B751) More information on antimicrobial therapy for blepharitis can be found in [Table 5](#AntimicrobialsUsedInTheTreatmentOfB-A47866DE).

### Ophthalmic Anti-inflammatory Agents

Some patients may require treatment with ophthalmic corticosteroids or **corticosteroid/antibacterial combinations** during exacerbations or for severe inflammation or complications.​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)​[[31]](#psc1014n1015) These ophthalmic eye drops or ointments should be prescribed on the advice of an ophthalmologist. Antibacterial ophthalmic ointments are preferred to drops because of increased contact time between the drug and tissues. The ophthalmic ointment may be applied externally on the eyelid margins by wiping across the closed eyelid near the lashes with a clean fingertip or cotton swab. The ointment may be instilled inside the conjunctival sac for more severe blepharitis or for overnight use. Although dexamethasone is a commonly used ophthalmic corticosteroid for blepharitis, loteprednol may be just as effective, with a lower risk of increased intraocular pressure.​[[38]](#ComstockTLDeCoryHH.LoteprednolEtabo-EE8934CF) Fluorometholone ophthalmic drops may also be considered due to lower ocular penetration.​[[26]](#AmescuaGAkpekEFaridMEtAl.Blephariti-EEAEF705) For further information on ophthalmic antibacterials and corticosteroids, see [Table 4](#TopicalAntimicrobialsBlepharitis).

### Other Agents

Immunomodulatory agents may be used under the direction of an ophthalmologist.​[[27]](#DuncanKJengBH.MedicalManagementOfBl-EC76AD2F)​[[28]](#PutnamCM.DiagnosisAndManagementOfBl-EC76AF3C) Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine 0.05% drops) have shown some efficacy in the control of meibomian gland dysfunction and posterior blepharitis.

Oral ivermectin has been found to reduce or even eradicate Demodex infestation in patients with blepharitis and/or ocular rosacea.​[[26]](#AmescuaGAkpekEFaridMEtAl.Blephariti-EEAEF705) For more information, see Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies.

### Natural Health Products

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Health Products: Single Entity.

Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., flaxseed oil supplements), which have anti-inflammatory properties and may enhance lubrication, may be useful in patients with tear deficiencies.​[[24]](#psc1014n01084) However, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial concluded that 12 months of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids did not significantly improve signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.​[[39]](#TheDryEyeAssessmentAndManagementStu-B657B342) For more information on ocular lubricants, see Dry Eye.

Treatment of blepharitis with **tea tree oil** lid cleansers or shampoo has shown promise, mainly due to efficacy against *Demodex* infestations.​[[27]](#DuncanKJengBH.MedicalManagementOfBl-EC76AD2F)​[[29]](#HossainPKonstantopoulosA.Blephariti-EC76B0C9)​[[40]](#MaherTN.TheUseOfTeaTreeOilInTreatin-EE85DA15) Tea tree oil also has broad antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties that alleviate symptoms of blepharitis, even without *Demodex* involvement.​[[40]](#MaherTN.TheUseOfTeaTreeOilInTreatin-EE85DA15)​[[41]](#MandalPKhanMIShahS.Drugs-DoWeNeedTh-EE86B666) For more information, see [Table 4](#TopicalAntimicrobialsBlepharitis).

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 3](#n01098) provides a monitoring plan, which should be individualized.​[[3]](#psc1014n1003)​[[7]](#psc1014n1005)​[[10]](#psc1014n1008)​[[17]](#psc1014n1010)​[[30]](#psc1014n1014)

**Table 3:** Monitoring of Therapy for Eyelid Conditions

| Eye Condition | Monitoring | Goal/Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stye | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: after 48 h | Spontaneous drainage within 48 h. | Requires assessment for further therapy if drainage does not occur within 48 h, if pain worsens or if there are signs of infection. |
| Chalazion | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: after 2–3 days | Improvement should begin within a few days. Complete resolution can take weeks to months. | Requires assessment for further therapy if the lesion is large and/or painful or if spontaneous drainage does not occur. For patients with blepharitis, encourage regular lid hygiene​ [a] to prevent chalazion recurrence. |
| Blepharitis | Patient: daily during exacerbation; less often when controlled Health-care practitioner: each visit in chronic disease; within 1 wk if patient requires anti-infective therapy | Control inflammation and discomfort. Reduce risk of severe, long-term complications. | Educate patients on chronic nature of blepharitis and the rarity of complete disease elimination. Encourage adherence with lid hygiene regimen, which in turn helps to control symptoms and reduce exacerbations.​ [a] Ensure that patients cleanse only the margin of the eyelid and do not scratch the eyeball or conjunctiva. Requires assessment for further therapy if patient presents with first episode of blepharitis or a severe exacerbation that requires anti-infective or other therapy. |
