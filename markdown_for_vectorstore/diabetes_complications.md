### Introduction

It is estimated that more than 3 million Canadians have been diagnosed with diabetes and there are many more who are unaware they have the condition; these numbers are continuing to rise.​[[1]](#CanadianInstituteForHealthInformati-CF0D52F8) Diabetes is the leading cause of adult-onset blindness, kidney disease and nontraumatic lower limb amputations. In addition, people with diabetes have a much higher risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in this population.​[[2]](#psc1027n1003) People with diabetes have higher mortality rates and decreased quality of life, primarily due to the complications of the disease. Diabetes costs the Canadian health-care system about $15 billion annually, and the majority of these costs are due to the complications of the disease.​[[3]](#psc1027n1002)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent and delay progression of microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease
- Establish a regular follow-up schedule based on established recommendations
- Ensure patients understand the role of pharmacologic therapy in preventing the onset and delaying the progression of complications
- Work with patients to achieve treatment targets (e.g., monitoring therapy, improving adherence, adding therapy where needed)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Lifestyle Interventions

Intensive lifestyle interventions in people with type 2 diabetes can produce improvements in weight management, fitness, glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors. The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial was a large (n = 5145), randomized controlled trial that examined whether intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss would decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or have obesity. Although the intervention arm did not show a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the intervention did achieve greater weight loss, improved fitness, reduced HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and lipids, and a reduction in the need for medications. There was also reduced sleep apnea, severe chronic kidney disease and retinopathy, depression, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and knee pain in the intervention arm resulting in lower health-care costs.​[[4]](#TheLookAHEADResearchGroupWingRRBoli-DC71AEA1) Because of these many benefits, in addition to improved quality of life, physical activity remains a cornerstone of therapy in diabetes care.

The recommendation for people with diabetes is a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, bicycling, swimming, jogging). This should be spread over at least 3 days of the week with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise. It should also be combined with at least 2 sessions per week (3 sessions preferable) of resistance exercise (e.g., weights, weight machines, resistance bands or one’s own body weight).​[[5]](#psc1027n1024) Patients are encouraged to follow Canada’s Food Guide. A nutritionally balanced, calorie-reduced diet is further recommended in people who or are overweight or have obesity in order to achieve a 5–10% weight loss.​[[6]](#DworatzekPDArcudiKGougeonREtAl.Nutr-9504404C) Finally, it is important to determine the smoking status of all patients and to encourage patients who currently smoke to begin the process of quitting by providing resources, support and medication if indicated.

### Alcohol Consumption

Alcohol may be incorporated into a diabetes meal plan, provided there are no other contraindications. Alcohol consumption may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, reduce hepatic glucose production and increase ketones; however, when used in moderation, it can be safe from a cardiovascular perspective.​[[7]](#ButtPBeirnessDGliksmanLEtAl.Alcohol-F01E2BE9) Alcohol consumption should be limited to ≤2 standard drinks per day and <10 standard drinks per week in nonpregnant, nonlactating females with diabetes and ≤3 standard drinks per day and <15 standard drinks per week in men. One standard drink is defined as 10 g of alcohol, which is contained in 341 mL of 5% alcohol beer, 43 mL of 40% alcohol spirits or 142 mL of 12% alcohol wine.​[[8]](#psc1027n1045)

- Increased physical activity and reduced or no food intake can increase the risk of hypoglycemia with alcohol ingestion. In those with type 1 diabetes, moderate consumption of alcohol with or within a few hours after the evening meal can result in hypoglycemia the following morning or up to 24 hours later.
- Those using insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., **meglitinides**, **sulfonylureas**) should be informed of the risk of delayed hypoglycemia resulting from alcohol consumption with or after the previous evening’s meal and advised of measures to prevent hypoglycemia, including consuming food with alcohol, eating a carbohydrate-containing snack before bed, adjusting insulin and monitoring blood glucose.
- Inform patients who use **metformin** that consuming alcohol within the suggested limits is unlikely to be problematic, but that acute or chronic ingestion of larger quantities of alcohol can contribute to the development of lactic acidosis.
- Alcohol contains 29 kJ or 7 cal/g, and can therefore contribute to weight gain. Alcohol-containing medications are unlikely to contribute to poor blood glucose management or weight gain when used in moderation.

### Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of new-onset blindness in the working-age population. The prevalence of proliferative retinopathy is 23% in people with type 1 diabetes, 14% in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy and 3% in people receiving non-insulin antihyperglycemic therapies.​[[9]](#KleinRKleinBEMossSE.EpidemiologyOfP-D02069C8) Risk factors for the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy are longer duration of diabetes, elevated HbA1c, increased blood pressure, dyslipidemia, anemia, pregnancy (in type 1 diabetes), proteinuria and severe retinopathy itself.​[[10]](#KleinRKleinBEMossSEEtAl.TheWisconsi-95044673)​[[11]](#KleinRKleinBEMossSEEtAl.TheWisconsi-957766A5) Because therapies are available that can improve vision and reduce the level of retinopathy, it is imperative that patients with diabetes be screened regularly for diabetic retinopathy to allow early diagnosis and treatment. Patients should be instructed to report changes in vision to a physician or optometrist.

### Investigations

- Screen/evaluate for retinopathy annually beginning 5 years after the onset of diabetes in all patients with type 1 diabetes (at or after age 15).​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)
- Screen for retinopathy in all patients, including children and adolescents, at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Follow-up every 1–2 years unless severity dictates more frequent evaluation tailored to the severity of the retinopathy.​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)
- Evaluate patients with diabetes during pregnancy planning, in the first trimester, throughout the pregnancy as needed and within the first year postpartum.​[[13]](#FeigDSBergerHDonovanLEtAl.DiabetesC-CF144689)

Individuals who start intensive diabetes management with frequent insulin injections or pump therapy should have their eyes checked pre- and postintervention, as there is a risk of worsening retinopathy (short term) due to intensification of diabetes therapy. Also, in the SUSTAIN-6 trial, which was designed to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes of the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, there was an increased risk of retinopathy complications with semaglutide compared to placebo. The risk was greatest in those with baseline retinopathy.​[[14]](#MarsoSPBainSCConsoliAEtAl.Semagluti-CF14C8F2) Rapid improvement in glucose control may have been the cause, although this is not conclusive. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy who are initiated on this agent should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Screening for diabetic retinopathy should be performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist either in person or through interpretation of retinal photographs taken through dilated pupils or undilated pupils with high-resolution, ultra-wide field imaging.​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)

Patients with retinopathy should be screened for other complications of diabetes.

Visually disabled people should be referred for low-vision evaluation and rehabilitation.​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Patients with moderate visual loss should have spectacle correction, enhanced magnification, vision aids and other measures to promote independence and quality of life.

Diabetic retinopathy may be treated with retinal photocoagulation (laser therapy) and vitreoretinal surgery.​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)

See also [Lifestyle Interventions](#topic-111331-5FB4AA03).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Optimal glycemic control has been shown to reduce the development and progression of retinopathy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.​[[15]](#TheWritingTeamForTheDiabetesControl-95043059)​[[16]](#psc1027n1020) Blood pressure control is also an important risk factor, and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrated that tighter blood pressure control reduced the progression of retinopathy.​[[17]](#UKProspectiveDiabetesStudyGroup.Tig-95044CC3) The target blood pressure for people with diabetes is less than 130/80 mm Hg.​[[18]](#DaskalopoulouSSRabiDMZamkeKBEtAl.Th-95044E94)​[[19]](#GilbertRERabiDLaRochellePEtAl.Treat-950451A0)

Review lipid control to ensure treatment goals are being met. Fenofibrate may be added to statin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes to slow the progression of retinopathy based on 2 randomized controlled trials. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, fenofibrate 200 mg daily reduced both the requirement for laser therapy (a pre-specified tertiary endpoint) and retinopathy progression among people with pre-existing retinopathy.​[[20]](#KeechACMitchellPSummanenPAEtAl.Effe-950456F7) In the ACCORD Eye study, the addition of fenofibrate 160 mg daily to simvastatin was associated with a 40% reduction in the primary outcome of retinopathy progression over 4 years.​[[21]](#ACCORDStudyGroupACCORDEyeStudyGroup-73C5052E)​[[22]](#ChewEYDavisMDDanisRPEtAl.TheEffects-73C507E8) The mechanism for the beneficial effect of fenofibrate in diabetic retinopathy has not been established and may be independent of its effect on plasma lipids.

Increased expression of the cytokine vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) plays a central role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Three anti-VEGF agents are available: ranibizumab, aflibercept and off-label use of bevacizumab. Local (intraocular) therapy with anti-VEGF agents has been shown to both improve vision and reduce macular edema. Anti-VEGF drugs are first line in the management of centre-involving diabetic macular edema, and a focal macular laser is used when central vision is not involved. Focal macular laser preserves only existing vision. Steroids are alternatives in the management of diabetic macular edema, including intraocular injections of triamcinolone, dexamethasone and fluocinolone. The disadvantage of intraocular steroids is the increased rates of glaucoma and cataract formation.​[[12]](#AltomareFKheraniALovshinJ.DiabetesC-CF144312)

. . . . .

### Chronic Kidney Disease

Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease in Canada, and kidney disease can decrease both life expectancy and quality of life.​[[23]](#FortinCMWilliamsBIvisFEtAl.Treatmen-CF14F6D4)​[[24]](#FoleyRNParfreyPSSarnakMJ.ClinicalEp-95045BB5) People with diabetes can develop various forms of kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy, ischemic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and other renal diseases; up to half of patients with diabetes will demonstrate signs of kidney damage over their lifetime.​[[25]](#WarramJHGearinGLaffelL.EffectOfDura-95045E4C)​[[26]](#ReendersKDeNobelEVanDenHoogenHJ.Dia-95046111)​[[27]](#WeirMR.AlbuminuriaPredictingOutcome-95046420) Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive disease with a slow and progressive increase in albuminuria, a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m​2 and can lead to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplantation. Risk factors are long duration of diabetes; lack of glycemic, blood pressure and lipid control; obesity; and cigarette smoking. Because all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are considered at high risk for cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors should also be assessed and optimized.

### Investigations

- Screen with a random ACR and a serum creatinine converted to an eGFR annually starting at time of diagnosis in those with type 2 diabetes. In adults with type 1 diabetes, annual screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis. This should be done when there are no transient causes of albuminuria (e.g., recent major exercise, urinary tract infection, febrile illness, decompensated heart failure, menstruation, acute increase in blood glucose or blood pressure) or low eGFR and when acute kidney injury or non-diabetic kidney disease is not suspected. A diagnosis of CKD is an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m​2 and/or random urine ACR ≥2.0 mg/mmol on at least 2 of 3 samples over a 3‑month period.​[[28]](#psc1027n1028)
- Assess cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol, obesity, physical activity) and consider the need for vascular protection therapies.
- Monitor serum creatinine and potassium at baseline and within 1–2 weeks of initiation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, during titration and during acute illness.
- Monitor eGFR when starting an SGLT2 inhibitor and routinely thereafter based on patient factors (e.g., volume status, blood pressure, renal function, other medications, illness).

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Encourage smoking cessation and a healthy body weight (see also [Lifestyle Interventions](#topic-111331-5FB4AA03)).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Maintain optimal blood pressure control to prevent or delay the progression of CKD.​[[29]](#MakiDDMaJZLouisJZ.EffectOfAntihyper-95046639) Add an ACE inhibitor or ARB in those with hypertension or albuminuria to delay the progression of kidney disease.​[[30]](#psc1027n1025)​[[31]](#RuggenentiPFassiAIlievaAPEtAl.Preve-D020E8C2)​[[32]](#psc1027n1027) Advise patients of childbearing potential about the importance of avoiding pregnancy if taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB because of the risk of congenital malformations.

##### Blockage of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

In people with diabetes and hypertension, the use of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB has been shown to reduce the risk of developing CKD.​[[31]](#RuggenentiPFassiAIlievaAPEtAl.Preve-D020E8C2) In addition, these agents have been shown to slow the progression of existing CKD.​[[33]](#MauerMZinmanBGardinerREtAl.RenalAnd-CF1700D0) As this renoprotective benefit has not been demonstrated in normotensive patients without albuminuria, these agents should not be used in all patients with diabetes to prevent nephropathy but rather in those with hypertension or albuminuria or in those meeting the criteria for cardiovascular protection (see [Cardiovascular Protection in People with Diabetes](#subcondition-115-CE1866A3)). In addition, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have also reduced albuminuria, slowed progression of renal disease and delayed the need for dialysis in those with nondiabetic CKD.​[[34]](#RuggenentiPPernaAGherardiGEtAl.Rena-CF17037E)​[[35]](#MaschioGAlbertiDLocatelliFEtAl.Angi-CF1705D1)​[[36]](#ShodaJKannoYSuzukiH.AFive-yearCompa-CF1707B4)​[[37]](#HouFFXieDZhangXEtAl.RenoprotectionO-CF1709FF) A combination of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system should not be used in the management of CKD, as although the combination may reduce albuminuria, it may lead to acute renal failure and increased risk of hyperkalemia without benefit.​[[38]](#MannJFSchmiederREMcQueenMEtAl.Renal-CF170C93)​[[39]](#ParvingHHBrennerBMMcMurrayJJEtAl.Ca-CF170E9D)​[[40]](#FriedLFEmanueleNZhangJHEtAl.Combine-CF1711CA)

##### Antihyperglycemic Agents

Optimal blood glucose control is important for reducing the development and progression of CKD. There is evidence that certain antihyperglycemic agents also have renal protective effects, independent of their glucose lowering. In adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD and an estimated eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m​2, an SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) should be used to reduce the risk of progression of nephropathy.​[[41]](#ZelnikerTAWiviottSDRazIEtAl.SGLT2In-3EC10EF2) In the renal trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, primary composite endpoints measuring progression of kidney disease were improved for all agents.​[[41]](#ZelnikerTAWiviottSDRazIEtAl.SGLT2In-3EC10EF2) The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is diminished at a reduced eGFR, but they may be added in those with renal impairment for their renal protective benefit.​[[28]](#psc1027n1028) Additional caution may be required when using these agents in this population, particularly monitoring for volume-related adverse events.

The GLP-1 agonists dulaglutide, liraglutide and semaglutide have also shown renal benefits in their respective cardiovascular trials, but the effects were primarily a reduction in macroalbuminuria compared to the hard renal outcomes demonstrated with the SGLT2 inhibitors.​[[14]](#MarsoSPBainSCConsoliAEtAl.Semagluti-CF14C8F2)​[[42]](#MarsoSPDanielsGHBrown-FrandsenKEtAl-CF171AAE)​[[43]](#MannJFEOrstedDDBrown-FrandsenKEtAl.-CF171D82)​[[44]](#GersteinHCColhounHMDagenaisGREtAl.D-73C948D7)

##### Managing Acute Illness

Regularly assess medications in patients with CKD to determine whether their renal function warrants dosage adjustment or discontinuation of renally eliminated or nephrotoxic medications (see also Chronic Kidney Disease).

**Table 1:** Medications Not to be Taken During an Acute Illness (Sick Days)​[[45]](#psc1027n1033)

| Letter | Drug/Class | Reason for Caution with Inadequate Fluid Intake |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S | S ulfonylureas | Renal clearance may be reduced, leading to increased risk of hypoglycemia |
| A | A CE inhibitors | May impair renal function |
| D | D iuretics, direct renin inhibitors | May impair renal function |
| M | M etformin | Renal clearance may be reduced, leading to increased risk of lactic acidosis |
| A | A ngiotensin receptor blockers | May impair renal function |
| N | N onsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs | May impair renal function |
| S | S GLT2 inhibitors | May impair renal function |

Advise all patients with diabetes, but especially those with CKD, about medications they should hold if they become ill with vomiting and/or diarrhea. These “sick-day” medications can be remembered using the mnemonic SADMANS (see [Table 1](#table-113323-E4CD6BBE)). Tailor the list to be specific to the names of the medications patients are taking. They should be instructed to hold these medications if they become ill and are unable to maintain adequate fluid intake due to vomiting and/or diarrhea. Patients should be instructed to monitor blood glucose more frequently and adjust their doses of insulin or other antihyperglycemic agents as necessary. Follow-up with patients to ensure they restart their medications once they are feeling better.

. . . . .

### Neuropathy

Detectable sensorimotor polyneuropathy will develop within 10 years of the onset of diabetes in 40–50% of individuals.​[[46]](#psc1027n1029) Risk factors include elevated blood glucose, elevated triglycerides, high body mass index, smoking and hypertension. Diabetic neuropathy can lead to foot ulceration and eventual amputation, and continues to be the leading cause of lower extremity amputation.

### Investigations

- Screen for peripheral neuropathy when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed and annually thereafter by assessing loss of sensitivity to the 10-g monofilament or to vibration at the dorsum of the great toe. In those with type 1 diabetes, annual screening should begin after 5 years’ postpubertal duration of diabetes.​[[47]](#psc1027n1030)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Counsel all patients on the importance of foot care to reduce the risk of ulceration and amputation resulting from reduced foot sensitivity.​[[47]](#psc1027n1030)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Optimal glycemic control is recommended for reducing the onset and progression of neuropathy.​[[47]](#psc1027n1030)

Anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, valproate) and antidepressants (amitriptyline, duloxetine, venlafaxine) may be used alone or in combination for symptomatic relief of peripheral neuropathic pain. Few people have complete relief and therefore a 30–50% reduction in baseline pain, as measured by a visual analogue scale of 0–10 with 10 being maximal pain, is considered a meaningful response.​[[47]](#psc1027n1030) Topical capsaicin and topical **nitrate** spray have also been studied.​[[48]](#TheCapsaicinStudyGroup.TopicalCapsa-06386C54)​[[49]](#AgrawalRPChoudharyRSharmaPEtAl.Glyc-F01ED962)​[[50]](#YuenKCBakerNRRaymanG.TreatmentOfChr-F01EDBBB) The cautious use of opioids for neuropathic pain is only for select patients after other options have failed due to the risks of tolerance, abuse, dependency and addiction.​[[51]](#ManchikantiLSinghA.TherapeuticOpioi-CF17841C) For more information on treatment, see Neuropathic Pain.

. . . . .

### Cardiovascular Protection in People with Diabetes

People with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, presenting as coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. People with diabetes have a cardiovascular age 10–15 years higher than their chronological age.​[[52]](#psc1027n1034)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

All patients with diabetes, regardless of age, require education on implementing a healthy lifestyle as a way to reduce cardiovascular risk:​[[53]](#psc1027n1036)

- Healthy body weight (see Obesity)
- Regular physical activity (see [Lifestyle Interventions](#topic-111331-5FB4AA03))
- Healthy diet

### Pharmacologic Choices

To promote optimal cardiovascular health, the treatment of all patients with diabetes should include:​[[53]](#psc1027n1036)

- Optimal blood glucose control based on individualized target (see Diabetes Mellitus)
- Optimal blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg (see Hypertension)
- Optimal lipid control (see Dyslipidemias)
- Smoking cessation (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation)

The use of pharmacologic therapy for vascular protection is based on the patient’s cardiovascular risk. The Diabetes Canada 2018 clinical practice guidelines have established the following criteria:​[[53]](#psc1027n1036)

- Statin therapy is recommended if:

  - clinical cardiovascular disease
  - ≥40 years of age
  - <40 years of age and one of the following:

    - diabetes present for >15 years and age >30 years
    - microvascular complications
    - presence of other risk factors (male, smoker, family history of premature cardiovascular disease [CVD], ECG abnormalities, ACR >2 mg/mmol)

  For those not at LDL-C goal despite statin therapy, a combination of a statin with a second-line therapy may be used. Generally, this is ezetimibe in combination with a statin. In the SHARP trial LDL-C reductions with simvastatin plus ezetimibe were associated with reductions in the incidence of major atherosclerotic events vs. placebo. Subgroup and heterogeneity analysis revealed no difference in risk reduction between participants with or without diabetes using the statin/ezetimibe combination.​[[54]](#BaigentCLandrayMJReithCEtAl.TheEffe-744B04D3)

  In those who have clinical cardiovascular disease, ezetimibe or the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab or evolocumab may be used to further reduce major cardiac events. The combination should also be considered in those with familial hypercholesterolemia.
- ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended if:

  - ≥55 years of age with additional cardiovascular risk factor or end-organ damage (albuminuria, retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy)
  - clinical cardiovascular disease
  - microvascular complications
- Low-dose ASA (81–162 mg) once daily should be used for secondary prevention of CVD in those who already have established CVD to prevent cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily may be used in those unable to tolerate ASA. ASA should not be used routinely for primary prevention of CVD in people with diabetes, but may be used in those with additional cardiovascular risk factors. In people with diabetes, ASA has shown little or no benefit in the reduction of myocardial infarction and stroke in primary prevention and there is an increased risk of GI hemorrhage​[[53]](#psc1027n1036)​[[55]](#Guirguis-BlakeJMEvansCVSengerCAEtAl-CF18BA99)​[[56]](#DeBerardisGSaccoMStrippoliGFMEtAl.A-CF18BD80)​[[57]](#XieMShanZZhangYEtAl.AspirinForPrima-CF18BFFE)
- Antihyperglycemic agents: in adults with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), a GLP-1 agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with cardiovascular benefit should be used to reduce the risk of either:

  - adverse cardiovascular events (liraglutide, dulaglutide, **sc** semaglutide, empagliflozin, canagliflozin)
  - hospitalization for heart failure (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) **or**
  - progression of nephropathy (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin)

. . . . .

### Heart Failure

People with diabetes are at high risk of heart failure, and the combination of heart failure and diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular death.​[[58]](#CavenderMAStegPGSmithSCJrEtAl.Impac-73CDC3D8)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

People with diabetes and heart failure should receive the same treatments as those without diabetes, including **RAAS blocking agents**, sacubitril/​valsartan, ivabradine and beta-blockers, as participants have been shown to benefit from these therapies in clinical trials (see also Heart Failure). Additional monitoring may be required when using RAAS blocking agents due to the higher risk of renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia in this population. The beta-blockers carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality for people with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (EF) and diabetes. While there is a theoretical concern of masking hypoglycemia with the use of non-selective beta-blockers, this risk remains unsubstantiated. Carvedilol, in comparison to other beta-blockers, has been shown to specifically improve glycemic control.​[[59]](#HaasSJVosTGilbertREEtAl.AreBeta-blo-CF18C23E)​[[60]](#BellDSLukasMAHoldbrookFKEtAl.TheEff-CF18C48A)

The presence of heart failure may influence the choice of antihyperglycemic therapy; some agents have been shown to increase the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, others have been shown to reduce this risk and some are neutral.

Metformin remains first-line therapy for glycemic control in people with heart failure, following the same precautions in terms of renal impairment and sick-day management as those without heart failure.

Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) can cause fluid retention and may increase the risk of heart failure. For this reason, Health Canada has advised that they are contraindicated in those with heart failure.

The DPP-4 inhibitors have been evaluated for their effect on cardiovascular outcomes. In these trials, alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin and sitagliptin have all been shown to be safe from a cardiovascular perspective.​[[61]](#WhiteWBCannonCPHellerSREtAl.Aloglip-CF18CE2C)​[[62]](#RosenstockJPerkovicPJohansenOEEtAl.-73CF51A4)​[[63]](#SciricaBMBhattDLBraunwaldEEtAl.Saxa-CF18C71C)​[[64]](#GreenJBBethelMAArmstrongPWEtAl.Effe-CF18CC14) However, there was an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure found with saxagliptin as a secondary endpoint. Caution is warranted if saxagliptin is used in patients with a history of heart failure.

The GLP-1 receptor agonists have also been evaluated for their effect on cardiovascular outcomes.​[[14]](#MarsoSPBainSCConsoliAEtAl.Semagluti-CF14C8F2)​[[42]](#MarsoSPDanielsGHBrown-FrandsenKEtAl-CF171AAE)​[[65]](#PfefferMAClaggettBDiazREtAl.Lixisen-CF18D14B)​[[66]](#HolmanRRBethelMAMentzRJEtAl.Effects-E4C28D97) Hospitalization for heart failure was evaluated as a secondary endpoint with neutral effects. None of these trials were specifically designed as heart failure trials and included only a small percentage of people with heart failure at baseline. Liraglutide has been evaluated in people with reduced EF in a small study with over half of the participants having diabetes, again showing no harm nor benefit.​[[67]](#MarguliesKBHernandezAFRedfieldMMEtA-CF18D42A)

Unlike the DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, the SGLT2 inhibitors have shown benefit in people with heart failure (reduced EF ≤40%) and an eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73m​2 in reducing the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death. In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial, people with heart failure and an EF ≤40% randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg daily had a lower risk of worsening of heart failure or cardiovascular death compared to standard of care.​[[68]](#McMurrayJJVSolomonSDInzucchiSEEtAl.-3EC2789F) Forty two percent of participants had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline. These findings together with earlier trials showing benefit with canagliflozin and empagliflozin support the recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors in people with heart failure both with and without diabetes.​[[69]](#NealBPerkovicVMahaffeyKWEtAl.Canagl-CF171678)​[[70]](#ZinmanBWannerCLachinJMEtAl.Empaglif-CF171878)

. . . . .

### Foot Care

Foot problems are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes, and such patients are more prone to developing serious foot problems than the general population. People with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease are predisposed to foot ulceration and infection, and this can lead to lower extremity amputation. Other risk factors include previous ulceration or amputation, structural deformity, limited joint mobility, microvascular complications, high HbA1c and onychomycosis.​[[71]](#psc1027n1037)​[[72]](#psc1027n1038)​[[73]](#psc1027n1040) Prevention of ulceration and infection is critical, and patients need to be educated on the importance of daily foot examinations.​[[74]](#psc1027n1042) Foot ulcers require early treatment using an interprofessional approach that addresses glycemic control, infection, offloading of high-pressure areas, assessment of lower extremity vascular status and wound care.

For discussion of the management of foot infections, see Diabetic Foot Infections.
