### Introduction

One of the most frequently encountered situations in primary care is the irritable child with a history of 2–3 days of fever, runny nose and cough. Most children with this clinical presentation have viral infections that do not require antibiotics; however, some children with signs of acute otitis media (AOM) may benefit from antibiotic therapy. AOM is defined as an infection of the middle ear; it causes symptoms such as otalgia and fever, while signs include the presence of middle ear effusion with a red, bulging tympanic membrane.​[[1]](#c0088n00019)

AOM can be caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens.​[[2]](#c0088n00011) It is often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection, which may alter respiratory tract defences by disturbing the epithelium and impairing mucociliary clearance. This may subsequently lead to eustachian tube dysfunction.​[[3]](#c0088n00009)​[[4]](#c0088n00010) The combination of events allows bacterial pathogens colonizing the nasopharynx to invade the middle ear and cause acute infection. An investigation of the microbiology of AOM in children with tympanostomy tubes reported that bacteria were isolated in 92% of middle ear effusions, while viruses were isolated in 70%; co-infection was noted in 66% of patients.​[[5]](#c0088n00012)

A number of prevention strategies for AOM have been assessed. Most strategies involve vaccination against AOM pathogens (see [Prevention](#Prevention-D64CEACE)) but risk factor modification has also been studied.​[[6]](#c0088n00013)​[[7]](#c0088n00014)​[[8]](#c0088n00015)​[[9]](#c0088n00017) Exposure to tobacco smoke is associated with higher risk of AOM in childhood.​[[7]](#c0088n00014)​[[9]](#c0088n00017) Breastfeeding is protective against respiratory tract colonization and is associated with lower rates of AOM in childhood.​[[8]](#c0088n00015)

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms, e.g., fever, irritability, pain
- Sterilize the middle ear
- Prevent complications, e.g., mastoiditis, intracranial infection, facial paralysis
- Avoid inappropriate therapy, which may lead to the emergence of resistant pathogens and adverse drug effects, e.g., antibiotic-associated diarrhea

### Investigations

- History:

  - fever
  - nonspecific symptoms of viral upper respiratory tract infection such as cough and coryza (i.e., common cold)
  - otalgia is a common manifestation and may be the best clue to the diagnosis; however, ear pain is not always easily communicated by infants and toddlers (disturbed sleep, irritability, tugging the ear or rubbing the head may suggest otalgia in young children)
- Physical examination:

  - focus on the head and neck region to rule out other causes of pain referred to the ear such as mastoiditis or dental abscess
  - assess for signs of middle ear effusion and middle ear inflammation; diagnosis of AOM requires presence of both​[[1]](#c0088n00019)
  - evaluate four key features of the tympanic membrane: colour, position, translucency and mobility; a red, displaced/bulging, opaque and immobile tympanic membrane indicates AOM
  - if there is significant swelling, erythema and tenderness noted in the external auditory canal (often with debris or discharge), otitis externa is likely present and requires a different management approach (see Otitis Externa)
  - note that proper visual inspection of the tympanic membrane may require the following: child to be restrained by parent, proper lighting, removal of cerumen obscuring proper view
- Referral:

  - for multiple treatment failures or recurrences unresponsive to therapy, consider referral to an ENT specialist who can obtain middle ear fluid for culture to identify the pathogen involved and its antibiotic susceptibility profile
  - refer children with frequent, recurrent episodes of AOM (≥3 episodes in 6 months or ≥4 episodes in 12 months)​[[10]](#Granath-14068BD8) to an ENT specialist for consideration of myringotomy and tympanostomy tubes
  - refer children with recurrent episodes of AOM for an audiology assessment to monitor for any conductive hearing loss

### Prevention

The use of vaccines for influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae is having a beneficial impact on the incidence of AOM and therefore should be encouraged for eligible patients.​[[6]](#c0088n00013)​[[11]](#c0088n00147)​[[12]](#c0088n00115)​[[13]](#c0088n00116)​[[14]](#c0088n00117)​[[15]](#c0088n00118)​[[16]](#NorhayatiMNCochrane-D64D3BAB) See the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-immunization-guide.html) for up-to-date recommendations on vaccine administration.

Public health measures (e.g., hand hygiene, masking, quarantine/isolation measures) may reduce virus transmission, leading to a reduction in overall AOM cases, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.​[[17]](#Favoretto-5AF8712D)​[[18]](#covidStuff) It is likely that COVID-19 vaccination may also reduce the risk of AOM in children by decreasing the overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, at time of publication, data are lacking.

### Therapeutic Choices

An approach to management of AOM based on risk factors is presented in [Figure 1](#c0088n00030). Risk factors for drug-resistant organisms include recent antibiotic use (<3 months), daycare attendance, recent episode of AOM, treatment failure and early recurrence.

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The strategy of *watchful waiting* has been recommended in many clinical practice guidelines for situations in which the child is over 6 months of age, illness is mild and uncomplicated, and a parent/caregiver can easily access the physician for communication/re-evaluation.​[[1]](#c0088n00019)​[[19]](#c0088n00023) A Cochrane review supports the watchful waiting approach for high-income countries such as Canada; 60% of AOM cases were found to resolve spontaneously within 24 hours regardless of antibiotic use. It is important to ensure appropriate analgesia as well as a discussion with caregivers about the rationale and safety of this approach.​[[20]](#VenekampRPSandersSLGlasziouPPDelMar-E7FE078A) The Canadian Paediatric Society guidelines also support the watchful waiting approach.​[[11]](#c0088n00147) For children presenting with AOM, consider this approach for the first 48 hours in children over 6 months of age, provided they have:​[[11]](#c0088n00147)

- Nonsevere illness (fever <39ºC, mild otalgia)
- Uncomplicated AOM (no episode in the preceding month, no acute facial nerve palsy, mastoiditis, meningitis nor labyrinthitis)
- No craniofacial anomalies, immunodeficiencies, cardiac or pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, or history of complicated AOM (e.g., mastoiditis, intracranial infection, facial paralysis)
- Parents capable of recognizing worsening illness with ready access to medical care

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Analgesics

Provide adequate analgesia in the early stages of infection. In most cases, acetaminophen (10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours to a maximum of 75 mg/kg/day and not more than 4000 mg/day) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours to a maximum of 40 mg/kg/day and not more than 2400 mg/day) is sufficient to control ear pain. Topical analgesia is not recommended.

### Antibiotics

Antibiotic therapies for the management of AOM are presented in [Table 1](#c0088n00033) and [Table 2](#c0088n00037).

The primary bacterial pathogens involved in AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis; clinical observations suggest that spontaneous resolution rates of AOM caused by these 3 pathogens are 20%, 50% and 75% respectively.​[[25]](#c0088n00025) Therefore, a watchful waiting approach (see [Nonpharmacologic Choices](#c0088n00086)) has been proposed for a subset of patients,​[[1]](#c0088n00019) which has been shown to reduce the number of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.​[[26]](#c0088n00027)

With the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the epidemiology of AOM is changing. Specifically, pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccines have decreased in frequency while the other serotypes have increased. Also, the proportion of cases due to S. pneumoniae have decreased while those due to H. influenzae have increased.​[[27]](#c0088n00102)​[[28]](#c0088n00187)​[[29]](#c0088n00188) Furthermore, the prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae has significantly decreased.​[[30]](#Angoulvant-140B3978)​[[31]](#Marom-140B3CF4) Overall, vaccination may be contributing to a decreased incidence of AOM.​[[27]](#c0088n00102)​[[32]](#KawaiK-140BE17C)

Antibiotic resistance is common among these 3 pathogens; therefore, choosing appropriate therapy depends on understanding the mechanisms of resistance involved. S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin is a result of alteration of penicillin-binding cell wall proteins, leading to decreased drug affinity. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin raises the drug concentration in the middle ear to allow effective killing of penicillin-resistant strains. For H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, beta-lactamase production confers resistance to amoxicillin, and therefore adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor such as clavulanate allows the antibiotic to work effectively when these pathogens are suspected. Treatment failure should be considered if symptoms do not improve after 72 hours of treatment.

### First-Line Antibiotics

Amoxicillin is considered first-line therapy in the treatment of AOM. The ideal dose is controversial, with several dosing regimens suggested by various sources.​[[1]](#c0088n00019)​[[33]](#c0088n00193)​[[34]](#c0088n00194)​[[35]](#c0088n00145)​[[36]](#c0088n00192) The 2016 Canadian Paediatric Society position statement suggests standard-dose or high-dose amoxicillin as first line for children requiring treatment of otitis media.​[[11]](#c0088n00147) The standard dose recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society differs from other standard dosing regimens. For dosing recommendations and other drug-related information (e.g., palatability), see [Table 2](#c0088n00037). When given at the higher dosage range, amoxicillin is likely to be effective against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae.​[[11]](#c0088n00147) Comparative antimicrobial studies have not been able to demonstrate clear superiority of one antibiotic over another (including standard-dose vs. high-dose amoxicillin), with the possible exception of amoxicillin over azithromycin.​[[33]](#c0088n00193)​[[34]](#c0088n00194) Furthermore, it is not clear whether in vitro resistance directly correlates with clinical failures for various infections caused by S. pneumoniae.​[[35]](#c0088n00145) In most areas of Canada, susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to amoxicillin is >90%.​[[11]](#c0088n00147) Based on a lack of evidence indicating superiority of high-dose amoxicillin, standard-dose amoxicillin is still a reasonable first-line option for AOM in children without risk factors for resistance, though local resistance patterns should be considered.​[[36]](#c0088n00192) A large surveillance program in Western Canada found that less than 1% of isolates of invasive S. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin.​[[37]](#RajapakseNSVayalumkalJVVanderkooiOG-1B6DFB43)

### Alternatives to First-Line Antibiotics

Amoxicillin/​clavulanate is typically used for treatment failure or recurrence. It possesses the added benefit of stability against beta-lactamases, produced by some strains of H. influenzae and most strains of M. catarrhalis. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is effective against most penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Randomized, placebo-controlled studies show that children with properly diagnosed AOM benefit from treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate, although diarrhea was noted as a common side effect.​[[21]](#HobermanAParadiseJLRocketteHEEtAl.S-916B96F2)​[[38]](#c0088n00180)​[[39]](#c0088n00181)

All other treatment options for AOM are less favourable than amoxicillin or amoxicillin/​clavulanate. Rates of resistance to other antibiotic classes such as cephalosporins and macrolides are on the rise.​[[40]](#c0088n00106)​[[41]](#c0088n00107)​[[42]](#c0088n00108) However, in situations of treatment failures and penicillin allergy, these antibiotic classes are alternatives.​[[1]](#c0088n00019)​[[43]](#c0088n00109)​[[44]](#c0088n00110) It is important to differentiate between those patients who have true type I hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or IgE-mediated) reactions and those who experience a nonspecific adverse effect to the antibiotic (e.g., rash, GI upset). In general, parents and patients overestimate the true frequency of allergic reactions.​[[45]](#c0088n00111)​[[46]](#c0088n00112) Cephalosporins with a dissimilar side chain (e.g., cefuroxime) can be used for patients who have previously experienced an allergy to penicillins (including IgE-mediated reactions).​[[47]](#NewBrunswick)

Cefuroxime **axetil** and cefprozil are second-generation cephalosporins with reasonable activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis because they are less susceptible than amoxicillin to the action of beta-lactamases. However, cephalosporins are less effective than high-dose amoxicillin against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. They can be used as second-line agents.

Ceftriaxone is the most effective of the cephalosporins against otitis media pathogens but is not used routinely because it is administered IV or IM daily for 3 days and is unnecessarily broad spectrum for the majority of patients.​[[48]](#c0088n00113)

Reserve azithromycin and clarithromycin for patients with type I hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics, due to rising resistance​[[40]](#c0088n00106)​[[41]](#c0088n00107)​[[42]](#c0088n00108) and treatment failure rates with macrolides.​[[49]](#c0088n00196)

Clindamycin is an alternative agent that can be used for patients with type I hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics, but it does not cover H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis.

### Duration of Therapy

A 10-day course of therapy is recommended in current Canadian guidelines for children <2 years of age. Cases of uncomplicated AOM in children ≥2 years of age should be treated for 5 days.​[[11]](#c0088n00147)

A 2017 trial comparing 5- and 10-day therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate in children <2 years of age found that 10-day therapy resulted in fewer cases of treatment failure and greater reduction in symptoms on days 6–14.​[[21]](#HobermanAParadiseJLRocketteHEEtAl.S-916B96F2) The 10-day course of therapy also applies to the drug of choice, amoxicillin.

For details regarding duration of therapy for those ≥2 years of age or for other antimicrobial agents, see [Table 1](#c0088n00033) and [Table 2](#c0088n00037).

### Therapeutic Tips

- Most children will have middle ear effusions after completion of therapy. There is no need to treat an abnormal-appearing tympanic membrane in an asymptomatic child. If middle ear effusion persists for longer than 3 months, arrange an audiology assessment to evaluate hearing.
- Nasal and oral decongestants alone or in combination with an antihistamine have not shown efficacy in resolving symptoms and infection or in preventing complications; they are not recommended for the management of AOM.​[[2]](#c0088n00011)​[[50]](#c0088n00114)
- When prescribing high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, in order to reduce the risk of diarrhea, it is best to give 2 simultaneous prescriptions: 1 prescription of amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day *plus* 1 prescription of 7:1 formulation amoxicillin/clavulanate liquid (Clavulin-200 or Clavulin-400) dosed at 40 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component (see [Table 2](#c0088n00037) for more information).
- Probiotics have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with a number needed to treat for benefit of 9.​[[51]](#Probiotics)

### Drug Table

**Table 2:** Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage[b] | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Penicillins**

| amoxicillin generics < $15 | Standard dose: 40– 50 mg/kg/day PO divided TID High dose: 75– 90 mg/kg/day PO divided BID Maximum: 4 g/day Reserve standard-dose amoxicillin for the limited number of children at low risk of being infected with drug-resistant bacteria (no daycare, no antibiotic in the prior 3-month period) | Excellent safety profile. Occasionally causes mild diarrhea. Maculopapular rash occurs uncommonly but is difficult to distinguish from a concomitant viral exanthem. | Drug of choice. For pneumococci with decreased susceptibility to penicillins and cephalosporins, amoxicillin is more active than cephalosporins. Most children tolerate the taste of the suspension. |
| amoxicillin /​ clavulanate Clavulin , Apo-Amoxi Clav , other generics $15–30 | 75– 90 mg/kg/day PO amoxicillin divided BID–TID Maximum: 4 g/day amoxicillin Best given as 2 simultaneous prescriptions to minimize the risk of diarrhea: 1 prescription of amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day plus 1 prescription of 7:1 formulation amoxicillin/clavulanate liquid (Clavulin-200 or Clavulin-400) 40 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component. Alternatively, 1 of the 7:1 formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate liquid (Clavulin-200 or Clavulin-400) can be given at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, but may cause more diarrhea. Some patients will tolerate these high-dose regimens better if daily dose is divided TID rather than BID | Excellent safety profile. Diarrhea occurs frequently. Maculopapular rash occurs uncommonly but is difficult to distinguish from a concomitant viral exanthem. | Use after failure of high-dose amoxicillin. Avoid the original formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate (Clavulin-125F and Clavulin-250F) in the high-dose protocol because the higher content of clavulanate increases the incidence of diarrhea. To avoid confusion when prescribing high-dose regimens, confirm intention on the prescription, e.g., write “ high-dose amoxicillin intended ” at the bottom. Active against most bacteria likely to cause AOM . Most children tolerate the taste of the suspension. |

**Drug Class: Cephalosporins**

| cefprozil generics $30–45 | 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1 g/day ) PO divided BID | Low incidence of diarrhea or GI upset. | Most children tolerate the taste of the liquid formulation and it is well absorbed. |
| ceftriaxone generics $30–45 | 50 mg/kg (maximum 1 g ) Q24H IM/IV × 3 days | Pain at injection site when administered IM. | Second- or third-line agent. May be diluted with lidocaine 1% plain to a final concentration of 300 mg/mL to minimize pain at injection site when given IM only . Do not reconstitute or mix with calcium-containing solutions. |
| cefuroxime axetil Ceftin , generics Tabs: $15–30 Oral susp: $30–45 | 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1 g/day ) PO divided BID-TID | Low incidence of diarrhea or GI upset. | Acceptable treatment option in cases of allergy to penicillins.​ [47] Suspension and tablets have an unpleasant, bitter taste. |

**Drug Class: Lincosamides**

| clindamycin Dalacin C , Dalacin C Flavored Granules , Dalacin C Phosphate Sterile Solution , generics Caps: < $15 Oral susp: $45–60 IV: $150 | 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1.8 g/day ) PO/IV divided TID For severe infections, may increase to 40 mg/kg/day (maximum 2.7 g/day ) IV divided TID–QID | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (common), esophagitis, rash, Clostridioides difficile –associated diarrhea. | Reserve for cases of true anaphylactic-type beta-lactam allergy and/or treatment failure. Clindamycin suspension has an unpleasant taste. If the dose prescribed is a multiple of a capsule strength (150 mg) , capsules can be opened and mixed with a soft solid, e.g., apple sauce, pudding, chocolate sauce. |

**Drug Class: Macrolides**

| azithromycin Zithromax , generics < $15 | 5-day treatment: Day 1: 10 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) once daily PO Days 2–5: 5 mg/kg (maximum 250 mg) once daily 3-day treatment: 10 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg ) once daily PO | Low incidence of diarrhea or GI upset. | Pneumococci with decreased susceptibility to penicillins and cephalosporins are sometimes resistant to azithromycin. Short course may improve adherence. Use if true anaphylactic-type beta-lactam allergy. Most children tolerate the taste of the suspension. |
| clarithromycin Biaxin , generics $30–45 | 15 mg/kg/day (maximum 1000 mg/day) PO divided BID | Diarrhea or vomiting (15%). | Pneumococci with decreased susceptibility to penicillins and cephalosporins are sometimes resistant to clarithromycin. Use if true anaphylactic-type beta-lactam allergy. Because it sometimes has a bitter aftertaste, the suspension should be taken with food and/or juice. |
