### Introduction

Bell palsy is a lower motor neuron paralysis of the facial nerve, often due to herpes simplex virus 1 infection, causing inflammation and edema.​[[1]](#c0013n00016) The classic presentation of Bell palsy includes acute onset of unilateral facial weakness affecting the upper and lower face, ear pain and altered taste. Involvement of other cranial nerves, remote CNS signs and systemic features would indicate further inquiry for the conditions listed in [Table 1](#c0013n00004).

Bell palsy affects about 20 persons per 100 000 per year without gender predominance.​[[2]](#c0013n00017) The incidence increases from early childhood until age 40 and remains static until late adult life, when it again increases. Pregnancy, hypertension, diabetes and immunizations (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine) may increase the risk of Bell palsy;​[[3]](#RafatiAPasebaniYJameieM)​[[4]](#HussainAHdukaCMothPEtAl.Bellx2019sF-AB8540D7)​[[5]](#JeongJYoonSRLimHEtAl.RiskFactorsF) nevertheless vaccine benefits still outweigh the risks.

Up to 85% of patients achieve spontaneous complete recovery without treatment. Those who will not recover cannot be identified by clinical features,​[[6]](#c0013n00018) although incomplete paralysis carries a better prognosis. In <10% of cases, the palsy recurs on either side.

### Goals of Therapy

- Promote complete recovery of function through prevention of denervation (loss of nerve supply as shown by weakness of the facial muscles, assessed clinically)
- Protect the eye from corneal abrasion
- Alleviate pain

### Investigations

Investigations are seldom needed after a complete history and physical examination have excluded other causes of peripheral facial palsy (see [Table 1](#c0013n00004)). Although relatively rare, the findings of slow-onset facial palsy, bilateral palsies, involvement of any other cranial nerves (i.e., limb weakness, numbness, truncal ataxia), or the presence of any systemic illness such as autoimmune disease, sarcoidosis or infection would indicate the need for specialist referral.​[[7]](#EvistonTJCroxsonGRKennedyPGEtAl.Bel-CF2E456C)

- Electromyography (EMG) and facial nerve conduction studies may help with prognosis but only after 8–10 days
- CT scan is appropriate if trauma is a likely cause
- Cranial MRI may be indicated in the presence of atypical features such as fever, immunocompromised state or other focal neurological symptoms or signs
- No laboratory tests are useful
- The (Canadian) Sunnybrook scale grades the severity of the facial palsy, but is used mainly by specialists to whom such patients have been referred because of inadequate recovery​[[8]](#RossBGFradetGNedzelskiJM.Developmen-AB8218B6)

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Unilateral Facial Palsy

| Differential Diagnosis | Additional Findings | Diagnostic Steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ramsay Hunt syndrome | Herpes zoster infection; vesicles in the ear or throat | Clinical diagnosis |
| Facial nerve tumors | Usually painless | Examine for neurofibromatosis |
| Cerebellopontine angle tumors | Evidence of VI, VIII or cerebellar deficits (failure of the eye to deviate laterally; deafness in the homolateral ear; incoordination of limb movements on the affected side) | Clinical diagnosis |
| Parotid tumors | Apparent on clinical examination | Clinical diagnosis |
| Mastoiditis | Apparent on clinical examination; deafness, discharge | Clinical diagnosis |
| Lyme disease | Skin and joint involvement | Serological testing; see Lyme Disease |
| Neurosarcoidosis | Variable depending on organ involvement | Chest x-ray |
| Brainstem lesions | Multiple sclerosis | MRI scan |
| Stroke | Extremities often involved | CT scan; see Acute Stroke |
| Rarely, diabetic ischemic cranial neuropathies, HIV and TB |  |  |
| Bilateral facial palsy is a feature of Guillain-Barré syndrome, Lyme disease, sarcoid and Wegener granulomatosis, and of other even rarer conditions. |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

No high-quality trials have been published that would allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture,​[[9]](#refitem-1162151-0847826A) although one study suggested that strong (i.e., painful) stimulation improved facial nerve function, disability and quality of life at 6 months more than painless acupuncture.​[[10]](#c0013n00076) The conclusions of a meta-analysis suggest that acupuncture has some positive effects in hastening recovery, but also acknowledge that the evidence available is of low quality.​[[11]](#ZhangRWuTWangREtAl.CompareTheEffica-AB828AC3)

Although the general evidence for physical therapy is of low quality,​[[12]](#c0013n00077) exercises for facial muscles may be helpful in the early stages of Bell palsy, ideally administered by a physiotherapist.​[[13]](#KhanAJSzczepuraAPalmerSEtAl.Physica-10980B28)

See also [Eye Care](#c0013n00007).

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0013n00010) illustrates the clinical management of Bell palsy. See [Table 2](#c0013n00013) for detailed drug therapy choices.

### Eye Care

To prevent corneal abrasions in any eye that cannot be closed voluntarily:

- Lubricate with ophthalmic drops, gels or ointment frequently (at least twice daily, up to every hour while awake if needed to prevent eye irritation)
- Tape the eyelid closed at night and protect with glasses during the day

### Analgesics

Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are occasionally required for the first 1–2 days to alleviate pain and edema/inflammation. Opioids such as morphine are rarely needed.

### Corticosteroids

Theoretically, the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids minimizes nerve damage, thus improving outcomes. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence that early corticosteroid therapy reduces pain, while clinical experience suggests that corticosteroid-treated patients are less likely to develop denervation. Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce rates of incomplete recovery as well as synkinesis and autonomic dysfunction in adults.​[[14]](#refitem-1162171-084C8CEF)​[[15]](#c0013n00058)

Early treatment (initiated within 48–72 hours of symptom onset) provides maximal benefit; evidence of benefit is less clear for treatment initiated 4–7 days after onset.​[[16]](#c0013n00056)​[[17]](#c0013n00078) Although several guidelines recommend treatment within 72 hours of onset, a 48-hour window appears to confer greater benefit.​[[18]](#PatelMPatelAZhouS.BellPalsy.CMAJ202-AD7EF531)​[[19]](#AxelssonSBergTJonssonLEtAl.Predniso) Oral prednisone is recommended (see [Figure 1](#c0013n00010) and [Table 2](#c0013n00013)).​[[15]](#c0013n00058)​[[17]](#c0013n00078)

In adults with *complete* unilateral facial paralysis, corticosteroid treatment started within 7 days of onset of paralysis showed clinically and statistically significant improvement in recovery of function,​[[20]](#c0013n00020) despite the lower probability of recovery associated with an increased severity at presentation.​[[21]](#c0013n00019)

For children, there is no demonstrated benefit from corticosteroid therapy. The risk of incomplete recovery from Bell palsy is exceptionally small. Reviews of the use of corticosteroids in children with Bell palsy concluded that their routine use in children is either not advisable,​[[22]](#c0013n00021)​[[23]](#BablFEHerdDBorlandMEtAl.PaediatricR-10989206) not beneficial​[[24]](#YooHWYoonLKimHYEtAl.ComparisonOfCon-AB83F175) or that there is insufficient evidence to make a treatment recommendation.​[[25]](#PitaroJWaissbluthSDanielSJ.DoChildr-2318E2CB)

### Antivirals

Antiviral therapy (acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir) alone provides no significant benefit over placebo in the treatment of Bell palsy.​[[26]](#GagyorIMadhokVBDalyFEtAl.AntiviralT-CF2C8736) Whether antivirals added to corticosteroids confer any additional benefit over corticosteroids alone is controversial.​[[15]](#c0013n00058)​[[27]](#c0013n00057) Some studies have demonstrated no additional benefit,​[[16]](#c0013n00056)​[[28]](#c0013n00055) while others show possible benefit, particularly in patients with more severe facial paralysis at presentation.​[[29]](#c0013n00059)​[[30]](#c0013n00060)​[[31]](#c0013n00072) A Cochrane review, based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, demonstrated that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids resulted in higher recovery rates and fewer sequelae than either modality alone.​[[26]](#GagyorIMadhokVBDalyFEtAl.AntiviralT-CF2C8736)

The finding of a greater benefit for add-on antiviral therapy may be due to the misdiagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome as Bell palsy. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a herpes zoster infection of the VII cranial nerve, typically with a visible skin eruption (vesicular rash); it can, however, present without skin involvement, in which case it becomes difficult to distinguish from Bell palsy.

Because adverse effects are minimal, antiviral therapy may be offered in conjunction with corticosteroids, particularly in patients with more severe paralysis at presentation or in those who are immunocompromised, to treat potential herpes-related etiologies, if present.​[[7]](#EvistonTJCroxsonGRKennedyPGEtAl.Bel-CF2E456C) There is no evidence available for antiviral use in children with Bell palsy. In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, antiviral therapy may be considered.

### Other Therapies

In the later stages of recovery, unwanted synkinetic movements of the face and increased tearing may occur, in which case local botulinum toxin injection has been shown to be helpful.​[[32]](#FuziJTaylorASiderisAEtAl.DoesBotuli-1099C12C) In cases in which synkinesis or other unwanted movements occur months after recovery, referral to a specialist for consideration of botulinum toxin injection would be appropriate.

### Surgical Procedures

A systematic review judged the quality of evidence to be low and insufficient to determine the benefit or harm of surgical interventions for nerve decompression in patients with Bell palsy.​[[33]](#c0013n00082) Minor long-term benefits have been shown with shortwave diathermy or facial nerve stimulation.​[[34]](#MarottaNDemecoAInzitariMTEtAl.Neuro-109A0D12)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Bell Palsy and Pregnancy

Bell palsy occurs more often during pregnancy.​[[4]](#HussainAHdukaCMothPEtAl.Bellx2019sF-AB8540D7) Most cases of Bell palsy in pregnant patients occur in the third trimester or during the first few postpartum weeks.​[[4]](#HussainAHdukaCMothPEtAl.Bellx2019sF-AB8540D7) In a retrospective population-based analysis of 242 000 deliveries over 20 years, the onset of Bell palsy during pregnancy and the puerperium was shown to be significantly associated with obesity, chronic hypertension, severe preeclampsia and associated Cesarean deliveries.​[[35]](#c0013n00081) This study did not find a link between Bell palsy and adverse perinatal outcomes such as low Apgar scores, perinatal mortality or congenital malformations.

Unfortunately, the prognosis for a satisfactory recovery for patients who develop Bell palsy while pregnant is significantly worse than for the general population.​[[36]](#c0013n00054)​[[37]](#PhillipsKMHeiserAGaudinREtAl.OnsetO-AB864F93) Whether this is due to differing etiologies or to a reluctance to prescribe corticosteroids during pregnancy has not been ascertained.

Supportive care is appropriate for most pregnant patients, since the majority of them will recover spontaneously. The decision to use corticosteroids for Bell palsy in pregnant patients should be made on an individual basis after discussing the risks and benefits with the patient. The effect of these drugs on the fetus is unclear and varies depending on the trimester; pregnant patients were excluded from studies evaluating corticosteroids for Bell palsy. First-trimester exposure to systemic corticosteroids is associated with a <1% increased risk of cleft palate.​[[38]](#Park-WyllieLMazzottaPPastuszakAEtAl-E11A8432) There is evidence, however, that exposure to steroids in and after the second trimester is likely safe.​[[4]](#HussainAHdukaCMothPEtAl.Bellx2019sF-AB8540D7)

If antivirals are required during pregnancy, acyclovir or valacyclovir may be considered; there is no evidence to suggest negative effect on fetal development.​[[39]](#PasternakBHviidA.UseOfAcyclovirVala-DA5F51A4) Famciclovir is not recommended for use in pregnant patients due to limited experience and documented cases of exposure.

### Bell Palsy and Breastfeeding

Treatment of Bell palsy with prednisone in a breastfeeding patient is considered safe and acceptable, as accumulation in breast milk appears to be low and there are no reports of demonstrated harm in exposed infants.​[[40]](#Prednisone.DrugsAndLactationDatabas-D94C1251) Of the antivirals, valacyclovir and acyclovir are preferred agents in breastfeeding patients due to minimal accumulation and reported adverse effects.​[[41]](#SheffieldJSFishDNHollierLMEtAl.Acyc-D94DDC72) There is limited information regarding famciclovir use in this patient population.​[[42]](#Famciclovir.DrugsAndLactationDataba-D94DF13A)

### Therapeutic Tips

- No treatment is needed for mild weakness that is no longer evolving.
- Use prednisone as soon as possible in all cases of Bell palsy involving paralysis unless there is a potential contraindication to steroid use, such as systemic fungal infection. Use caution in patients with diabetes, peptic ulcer disease or those who are pregnant.
- There is no good evidence for benefit from prednisone that is started more than 7 days after the onset of symptoms.
- Based on available evidence, the use of antiviral agents with prednisone for Bell palsy may be warranted in those with severe facial weakness and in those who are immunocompromised.​[[7]](#EvistonTJCroxsonGRKennedyPGEtAl.Bel-CF2E456C) The evidence for the routine use of antivirals in Bell palsy is accumulating, but expert opinion remains divided.
- No evidence supports the use of antiviral therapy alone.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd304132e829) The addition of antiviral therapy may be considered, particularly in patients with severe facial paralysis, in suspected Ramsay Hunt syndrome and in patients who are immunocompromised.
