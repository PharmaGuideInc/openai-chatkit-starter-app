CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “women” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature and describes individuals who have been assigned female at birth. We are aware that this term is not inclusive of all patients.

### Introduction

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, increased tenderness, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction not attributable to other disease states. Fibromyalgia affects 2–4% of the general population and of those affected, 80–90% are women. In general, symptom onset occurs between 30 and 60 years of age. Central and peripheral system changes in terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, central sensitization, wind-up (a progressive increase in sensitivity over time, i.e., lower stimuli result in increased pain), elevated excitatory neurotransmitters, vasoconstriction, ischemia and adrenergic receptor sensitivity have been described, although none have been identified as clear causative factors.

While the etiology of fibromyalgia is not entirely clear, associations with trauma, adverse life events, impaired mood (e.g., depression), anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bladder syndrome, cold intolerance, paresthesias and coaggregation within families have been described.​[[1]](#c0053n00216)​[[2]](#Arnold2004)​[[3]](#Yavne2018) Consequently, a patient-tailored approach to treatment is ideal to address both symptoms of fibromyalgia and any associated conditions.

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce pain, fatigue, psychological distress and sleep problems
- Improve physical and emotional well-being, functioning and quality of life
- Address associated conditions on an individual basis
- Promote self-management via individual and group education

### Investigations

A systematic stepped approach starting with a thorough history, followed by physical examination and basic laboratory work is recommended for patients presenting with chronic wide spread pain. Though fibromyalgia can coexist with other conditions associated with chronic pain, it is essential that the clinician considers all possible differential diagnoses (see [Table 1](#differential)).

- History should include:
  - Pain history, including location, onset, frequency, duration and any possible aggravating factors
  - History of possibly associated symptoms, including fatigue and sleep disturbance
  - Personal and family medical history, including drug use, chronic pain syndromes and mental health disorders
- Physical examination should include joints examination, neurological examination as well as an assessment of tenderness
- Basic laboratory blood work may be considered

Diagnosing fibromyalgia remains a challenge. Depending on the patient population, it can be underdiagnosed, overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (e.g., biases may lead to an overdiagnosis in women presenting with chronic widespread pain).​[[4]](#Hauser2019)​[[5]](#Wolfe2018) Diagnostic and classification criteria aim to decrease the uncertainty when making a diagnosis or selecting patient research participants respectively. As our understanding of fibromyalgia evolved, the classification and diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia evolved as well. The earliest (1990) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria used the tender-point examination as a tool for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.​[[6]](#Wolfe2011) In 2016, the ACR published provisional diagnostic criteria that provided a case definition for fibromyalgia based on the widespread pain index (WPI) and the symptom severity scale (SSS) (see [Figure 1](#fig-11023-2181382B)).​[[7]](#Wolfe2016) The Canadian Rheumatology Association and Canadian Pain Society endorsed similar diagnostic criteria to the updated ACR criteria indicating that “examination for tender points is not required to confirm the diagnosis.​[[8]](#Fitzcharles2013) In 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Pain Society (APS) initiated the ACTTION-APS Pain Taxonomy (AAPT) to develop a diagnostic system that would be consistent across chronic pain disorders. The AAPT, consisting of an international working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in fibromyalgia, generated a multidimensional diagnostic framework to be applied to fibromyalgia (see [Table 2](#AAPTcriteria)).​[[9]](#Arnold2019) The AAPT does not require a tender point examination.

The 2016 ACR criteria and the 2019 AAPT criteria have comparable sensitivity and specificity,​[[10]](#Salaffi2020) and therefore either one can be used to confirm a diagnosis.

**Table 1:** Differential Diagnosis of Chronic Widespread Pain

**Table 2:** AAPT Dimensions for Fibromyalgia

| Dimension 1: Core diagnostic criteria | Multisite pain defined as 6 or more pain sites from a total of 9 possible sites (head, left arm, right arm, chest, abdomen, upper back and spine, lower back and spine including buttocks, left leg, and right leg) Moderate to severe sleep problems OR fatigue Multisite pain plus fatigue or sleep problems must have been present for at least 3 months |
| Dimension 2: Features that may support diagnosis of fibromyalgia | Tenderness Dyscognition (e.g., trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, and disorganized or slow thinking) – may be assessed using self-reported questionnaires Musculoskeletal stiffness Environmental sensitivity or hypervigilance (e.g., intolerance to bright lights, loud noises and cold) |
| Dimension 3: Common comorbidities | Somatic pain conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, migraine and chronic headaches) Psychiatric conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse disorders) Sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome) Rheumatic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) Other (e.g., joint hypermobility syndrome, rhinitis and urticaria, obesity) |
| Dimension 4: Neurobiological, psychosocial and functional consequences | General outcomes (worse quality of life, greater disability, mood and sleep disturbances when compared with controls without fibromyalgia, but an improvement and remission has also been reported) Mortality and morbidity (reports are inconsistent, maybe associated with increased frailty, slower cognition and increased risk of stroke, probably not associated with increased mortality) |
| Dimension 5: Putative neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms and risk factors | Risk factors and comorbidities (personal lifetime history of chronic pain, family history of chronic pain, early lifetime adverse events and trauma, e.g., abuse, certain types of infections such as Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease) Pathophysiology (unclear, proposed mechanisms include genetic mutations, amplification of sensory stimuli, neurotransmitter abnormalities) |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic management of fibromyalgia should be first-line therapy, especially due to a lack of strong data to support the use of medications. When recommending nonpharmacological therapies, health-care providers should seek out resources and facilities in their communities that promote overall health and/or focus on a physical, psychological or social issue that is germane to the patient’s health/pain issue.

- Health-Care providers showing empathy and acknowledging suffering is fundamental.
- Patient education, e.g., the Arthritis Society’s Arthritis Self-Management Program, can improve pain, sleep, fatigue, quality of life and the 6-minute walk test. Improvement can last at least 3–12 months.​[[11]](#Bruno2006) A patient-centred approach to education is recommended.​[[12]](#c0053n00111) Health-care providers can discuss the individual patient’s psychosocial risk factors for chronic pain (i.e., factors that predispose, exacerbate or cause chronic pain) and recommend individualized management strategies.​[[13]](#Finestone2012) Supplementing this discussion with an individualized graphical tool can improve the patient’s information recall.​[[14]](#Finestone2015)
- A comprehensive, multidisciplinary program of education, self-management, nonpharmacologic pain–reduction techniques, graded aerobic exercises, sleep hygiene, stress management and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is thought to be beneficial,​[[15]](#c0053n00010) although a Cochrane review indicated too few high-quality randomized controlled trials to support this common viewpoint.​[[16]](#c0053n00110)
- Ongoing CBT sessions are one component of the multidisciplinary treatment of fibromyalgia. CBT has been shown to improve the number of tender points, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, pain coping, pain behaviours, depression and physical function.​[[17]](#c0053n00113)
- Supervised aerobic exercise, walking programs, aquatic exercises, graded-exercise programs, strength training and tai chi can improve function, symptoms and well-being.​[[18]](#c0053n00219)​[[19]](#c0053n00166)​[[20]](#Kim2019)​[[21]](#Bidonde2019)​[[22]](#c0053n00011)​[[23]](#c0053n00112)​[[24]](#c0053n00165)
- Nonpharmacologic pain–reduction techniques include cold, heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), massage, and relaxation techniques such as biofeedback, meditation and hypnosis.​[[25]](#c0053n00164)​[[26]](#Dailey2020) Electroacupuncture appears to be more effective than acupuncture.​[[27]](#c0053n00016)​[[28]](#c0053n00172)​[[29]](#c0053n00233)
- Specific identification and subsequent therapy for a particular life event such as history of sexual,​[[30]](#c0053n00241) physical or emotional abuse, deprivation, post-traumatic stress disorder, or any other psychologically distressing event can be efficacious as part of the overall treatment approach, in the clinical experience of the author.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of fibromyalgia are presented in [Table 3](#c0053n00022).

Because the etiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown, drug treatments are largely empiric. Patients should receive individualized pharmacotherapy tailored to treat their symptoms. Studies have been of short duration and varying quality.

### Antidepressants

A wide range of antidepressants have been used in the management of fibromyalgia, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and SNRIs.​[[31]](#c0053n00220)​[[32]](#c0053n00221)

Low doses of amitriptyline at bedtime (e.g., starting at 5 mg and progressing slowly, every 2–3 wk, to a maximum of 50 mg) can improve sleep and reduce pain and fatigue.​[[33]](#c0053n00180) Only short-term efficacy has been shown (≤8 wk).​[[33]](#c0053n00180) A Cochrane review suggests that although it is an appropriate initial treatment, amitriptyline will achieve satisfactory pain relief in only a minority of patients.​[[34]](#c0053n00222) If taken 1–2 hours before bedtime, the effect will start at bedtime, and morning hangover will be lessened.

The SNRI duloxetine does not improve fatigue, quality of life or sleep disturbances but provides a small reduction in fibromyalgia pain.​[[35]](#c0053n00223) Duloxetine is generally well tolerated but some patients may discontinue its use due to nausea, dry mouth, constipation or headache. Duloxetine may be considered as first-line drug therapy in fibromyalgia patients with concomitant depression. Venlafaxine has not been studied in patients with fibromyalgia. However, milnacipran, an SNRI not available in Canada, was shown to be beneficial in treating fibromyalgia symptoms.​[[36]](#c0053n00167) The levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, is marketed in Canada but is indicated only for short-term management of major depressive disorder and has not been studied for the management of fibromyalgia.

Although SSRIs have been commonly used in the management of fibromyalgia, a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that they have a minimal effect on pain and global improvement, and no effect on sleep or fatigue.​[[37]](#c0053n00074) SSRIs can be considered in patients with fibromyalgia and concomitant depression.​[[33]](#c0053n00180)​[[37]](#c0053n00074) Fluoxetine in the morning with evening amitriptyline was more effective than either agent alone in a double-blind controlled trial in fibromyalgia sufferers.​[[38]](#c0053n00014)

### Gabapentinoids

Evidence from a single randomized controlled trial suggests that gabapentin may improve pain scores and sleep in patients with fibromyalgia.​[[39]](#c0053n00203) Pregabalin may be used in adults with fibromyalgia. In clinical trials, substantial pain reduction (≥50% pain intensity reduction) with pregabalin was demonstrated in about 9% more patients than with placebo (22–24% with pregabalin compared with 14% with placebo).​[[40]](#c0053n00116) Similarly, a moderate pain reduction (≥30% pain intensity reduction) was observed in about 11% more patients than with placebo (39–43% with pregabalin compared with 28% with placebo). Pain relief with pregabalin was also accompanied by improvement in quality of life, sleep and function.​[[41]](#c0053n00184) Pregabalin was shown to be beneficial at doses of 300–450 mg/day; doses higher than 450 mg did not produce greater symptom improvement, while lower doses (150 mg/day) were not different from placebo. Doses of pregabalin should be titrated slowly upward, beginning with 25–50 mg at bedtime, to minimize adverse effects (drowsiness, dizziness).

### Other Drugs

**NSAIDs** are not recommended for the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia.​[[33]](#c0053n00180)​[[42]](#refitem-1162132-09CBC5AB) They are likely not useful because the pain is the result of central sensitization and abnormal pain signalling rather than peripheral pain or inflammation. The use of NSAIDs in patients with fibromyalgia results in increased adverse effects with no difference in pain reduction compared to placebo.​[[42]](#refitem-1162132-09CBC5AB) If considered for use in a concurrent condition, use the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time frame.

Cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant that is structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants, is somewhat effective in fibromyalgia, particularly in improving sleep.​[[43]](#c0053n00073)

There is no good evidence to suggest that opioid analgesics are effective for the relief of pain in fibromyalgia.​[[44]](#c0053n00224) Additionally, several fibromyalgia guidelines recommend against the use of opioids as part of therapy.​[[33]](#c0053n00180) Of particular concern is the risk of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, since fibromyalgia patients may already have central sensitization (hyperalgesia). Despite the lack of evidence and guidance, inappropriate and widespread use of opioids exists in this patient population.

Although tramadol (with or without acetaminophen) has been reported to reduce pain and to improve health-related quality of life in individuals with fibromyalgia,​[[45]](#c0053n00114)​[[46]](#c0053n00115)​[[47]](#c0053n00077)​[[48]](#c0053n00078) the effect is likely due to the fact that it reduces reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine rather than to its opioid action.​[[45]](#c0053n00114)​[[47]](#c0053n00077) Additionally, as with other opioids, tramadol use is associated with a high risk of addiction.​[[49]](#Thiels2019) Tramadol may therefore only be considered if alternative therapies have been ineffective or not tolerated and after careful consideration of the individual patient’s risk of dependence (e.g., history of substance abuse, see Opioids (CPhA Monograph) and Opioid-Related Disorders).

A 2016 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of nabilone in the treatment of fibromyalgia.​[[50]](#refitem-1192136-80CF6C11) Despite the lack of evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the management of fibromyalgia, patients may choose to try medical cannabis for symptom management. For more information, see the [Canadian Rheumatology Association’s](https://rheum.ca/resources/publications/canadian-rheumatology-association-cra-position-statement-on-medical-cannabis-use-in-rheumatic-disease/#:~:text=Medical cannabis should not be,a prescription for medical cannabis.)  and [the College of Family Physicians of Canada’s](https://www.cfpc.ca/CFPC/media/Resources/Health-Policy/Medical-Marijuana-Position-Statement-CFPC.pdf) position statements on the use of medical cannabis.

As insomnia significantly increases symptoms severity in fibromyalgia,​[[51]](#Huang2019) drugs used in the management of insomnia may benefit those with severe sleep dysfunction but do not provide effective reduction of pain. Dependency and adverse effects are also concerns. Zopiclone might be useful intermittently but evidence is lacking.​[[52]](#c0053n00079) Antidepressants with sedative properties, such as amitriptyline and trazodone, are commonly used in fibromyalgia patients to improve sleep.​[[53]](#c0053n00227)

Treatment of peripheral pain generators by local injection (e.g., usually lidocaine 1% with or without a depot form of **corticosteroid**) to myofascial trigger points may reduce the total pain burden and the perpetuation of central pain sensitization.​[[54]](#c0053n00019)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Fibromyalgia and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Before conception, patients with fibromyalgia and comorbid myofascial face pain may have reduced fertility.​[[55]](#c0053n00141)

There is little published evidence regarding the effects of pregnancy on patients with fibromyalgia. Theoretically, elevated levels of cortisol and relaxin during pregnancy may ease symptoms in some patients. An analysis of 1178 women determined that fibromyalgia did not affect pregnancy outcomes or newborn health, but almost all patients reported worsening symptoms during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester.​[[56]](#c0053n00142) Symptoms were worse postpartum in many patients (but eventually returned to previous levels); anxiety and depression also increased after delivery.

### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

Nonpharmacologic approaches to pain control, stress management and energy conservation should be encouraged during pregnancy. A reminder that many fibromyalgia symptoms (generalized pain, fatigue, back pain, muscle weakness, depression and stiffness) are similar to those that also occur in healthy patients during pregnancy may help patients cope better. Adequate support is important throughout pregnancy and afterwards.

If nonpharmacologic options are insufficient to manage symptoms and drug treatment is deemed necessary, the following information may serve as a guide in making an informed decision. Acetaminophen is an appropriate analgesic for use in pregnancy. Short-term NSAID use may also be considered in the first and second trimester, if needed, for a concurrent condition; however, use in the third trimester may be of concern. Because of antiprostaglandin effects, NSAIDs can increase risks of fetal and maternal bleeding and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, and can also interfere with labour onset or duration.​[[57]](#c0053n00143) On October 30, 2020, Health Canada started investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant patients 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[[58]](#HCNSAIDsPregnancy1) This investigation is in response to a U.S. FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[[59]](#FDANSAIDs20201) While short-term use may not pose a significant increased risk, use beyond 48 hours may require ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected. Use of tramadol during pregnancy is not advised; neonatal withdrawal has been reported after long-term tramadol treatment in the pregnant parent.​[[60]](#c0053n00144)​[[61]](#c0053n00145)

There is limited evidence on the effects of gabapentin or pregabalin in pregnancy or during breastfeeding. A preliminary study suggests gabapentin does not increase risk of major malformations, although it may be associated with other complications including low birth weight and preterm birth.​[[62]](#c0053n00228) Until more information is available regarding their safety in pregnancy, use of gabapentin or pregabalin during pregnancy cannot be recommended.

If there is co-existing depression with fibromyalgia, the risk/benefit ratio may favour continuing treatment with antidepressants during pregnancy (see Depression).

Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline appear relatively safe during pregnancy. The SNRIs, e.g., duloxetine, while not associated with increased risk of congenital malformations, have been associated with short-term agitation, jitteriness and poor feeding in the neonate. Newborns exposed to SSRIs in utero had an increased incidence of preterm birth, low Apgar scores, increased admission to neonatal intensive care​[[63]](#c0053n00146) and seizures; fetal death has been reported.​[[64]](#c0053n00147) Maternal use of fluoxetine and other SSRIs has been associated with neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension​[[65]](#c0053n00148) and septal heart defects.​[[66]](#c0053n00157) Neonatal withdrawal syndrome may occur.​[[67]](#c0053n00153)

### Fibromyalgia and Breastfeeding

After delivery, lack of sleep and stress may aggravate fibromyalgia symptoms. Muscle pain, stiffness and fatigue may result in discomfort and interfere with the breastfeeding process. Proper positioning during feeding, feeding while lying down, use of pillows or other supports, and adequate rest periods may assist breastfeeding for the patient with fibromyalgia. Referral to a lactation consultant may be useful.

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are considered compatible with breastfeeding. Most other NSAIDs are also considered compatible but their benefit for fibromyalgia pain is limited; choose agents with shorter half-lives when possible. Small amounts of tramadol and its metabolites are transferred into breast milk, but published data of the effects on infants are lacking.​[[68]](#c0053n00149)

Tricyclic antidepressants can cause sedation in the newborn if used in the antenatal period or during lactation. SSRIs and SNRIs are transferred into breast milk. Although some studies report no adverse effects from fluoxetine on breastfed infants,​[[69]](#c0053n00150) poor weight gain, irritability, colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or decreased sleep have been noted in others.​[[70]](#c0053n00155)​[[71]](#c0053n00156) The effects of duloxetine​[[72]](#c0053n00152) on the infant are unknown. More studies are needed to confirm safety of pregabalin during breastfeeding; however, some experts recommend continuation of pregabalin (with monitoring of the infant for drowsiness) in patients for whom pharmacotherapy is deemed necessary and use of alternative drugs with more evidence of safety is not possible.​[[73]](#Lactmedpregabalin)

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- The treatment of arthritis, hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy and other medical conditions may be complicated by concomitant fibromyalgia.
- Although there is no clear causal relationship, patients with fibromyalgia are more likely to meet the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.​[[74]](#Hxe4userWGalekAErbslxf6h-Mxf6llerBE-69B8FEAC) Similarly, patients with fibromyalgia are more likely to suffer from certain conditions, e.g., depression (see Depression), irritable bowel syndrome (see Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and chronic low-back pain (see Low Back Pain).​[[75]](#KODNERC2015) Managing any comorbidities is therefore essential.
- If drug therapy is appropriate, pharmacologic agents work best when combined with nonpharmacologic modalities, ideally as part of a multidisciplinary treatment program.​[[15]](#c0053n00010)
- It is important to document not only reduced pain but also improved function.
- In the experience of the author and other clinicians, patients with fibromyalgia may be unusually sensitive to drug side effects; a rational approach is to start medications at low doses and increase slowly by small increments.
- The initial improvement of fibromyalgia with pharmacotherapy fades with time. Patients may experience remission not necessarily attributed to any specific therapy. Conversely, there are subsets of patients who are intolerant of and/or unresponsive to all pharmacologic therapy.
- Sleep problems may need further study in a sleep disorder clinic (see Insomnia).​[[51]](#Huang2019)
- Concomitant mood disorders require higher doses of antidepressants than are used for fibromyalgia. For more information regarding antidepressants, see Depression.
- Counselling the patient to recognize the roles of various social, psychological and/or environmental factors in the exacerbation or aggravation of their pain can lead to rewarding reductions in pain intensity. Emphasizing that the pain is “not in your head” but that life events and occurrences may be playing various roles in the syndrome’s expression can be clinically beneficial.

**Drug Class: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors**

| fluoxetine Prozac , generics <$15 | 10–20 mg QAM PO Maximum dose: 60 mg/day (better efficacy in 1 trial when combined with amitriptyline in the evening)​ [38] | Upon initiation: GI upset, anorexia, dry mouth, diaphoresis, headache, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, anxiety, agitation, tremor. Usually resolve after 2 wk of therapy. Others: sexual dysfunction, weight gain, SIADH with hyponatremia. Anxiety upon initiation is common. | Fluoxetine is a substrate of CYP 2C9 and CYP 2D6 enzymes and is subject to drug interactions. Concurrent use with MAOIs , linezolid and methylene blue is contraindicated due to increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Use caution if combining with other serotonergic agents. Increased risk of GI bleeding with NSAIDs , antiplatelet agents. Avoid concurrent use with drugs associated with prolonged QTc interval/torsades de pointes. Fluoxetine is also a potent inhibitor of CYP 2D6. |

**Drug Class: Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors**

| duloxetine Cymbalta , generics $15–30 | 30– 60 mg once daily PO Maximum dose: 120 mg/day (divided BID) | Nausea, headache, constipation, drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth. Do not use in patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr <30 mL/min). | Alcohol, CNS depressants. MAOIs may cause serotonin syndrome (severe reaction—tremor, agitation, hypomania, hypertension). Tramadol may also increase risk of serotonin syndrome. Do not use with potent CYP 1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, ketoconazole). CYP 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., SSRIs ) may increase duloxetine levels. |

**Drug Class: Tricyclic Agents**

| amitriptyline Elavil , generics <$15 | 5– 50 mg daily PO 1–2 h before bedtime (start low and titrate slowly) | Anticholinergic (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, tachycardia, delirium), antihistaminergic (sedation, weight gain), orthostatic hypotension, lowered seizure threshold; sexual dysfunction. | Combination with MAOIs may result in mania, excitation, hyperpyrexia; barbiturates, carbamazepine and rifampin may decrease effect; cimetidine and antipsychotics may increase effect and toxicity; possible interaction with antiarrhythmics (may lead to increased effect of either drug); may decrease antihypertensive effect of clonidine; may increase hypotensive effect of thiazides. |
| cyclobenzaprine Cyclobenzaprine , other generics <$15 | 10 mg at bedtime PO; may titrate to 40 mg/day taken in 2–4 divided doses; lower doses (<5 mg) may also be effective​ [77] | Anticholinergic (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, tachycardia, delirium), antihistaminergic (sedation, weight gain), orthostatic hypotension, lowered seizure threshold; sexual dysfunction. | Combination with MAOIs may result in mania, excitation, hyperpyrexia; barbiturates, carbamazepine and rifampin may decrease effect; cimetidine and antipsychotics may increase effect and toxicity; possible interaction with antiarrhythmics (may lead to increased effect of either drug); may decrease antihypertensive effect of clonidine; may increase hypotensive effect of thiazides. |
