### Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a systemic disease largely caused by smoking and characterized by progressive, partially reversible airway limitation and increasing frequency and severity of exacerbations. COPD is preventable and treatable. The cardinal symptoms are shortness of breath and activity limitation.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Research suggests that genetic variations may play a role in determining the presentation and severity of symptoms.​[[3]](#CastaldiPJDyJRossJEtAl.ClusterAnaly-8410864A)

The breathlessness experienced by people with COPD often causes them to restrict physical activity. Restriction of activity is the beginning of a downward spiral of deconditioning and will result in further restrictions of activity. Smoking cessation and optimal bronchodilation are key strategies in the management of COPD to slow decline, relieve symptoms, reduce the risk of an acute exacerbation (AE), and improve or maintain the patient’s activity level and quality of life.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent disease progression
- Decrease or eliminate breathlessness and other respiratory symptoms through optimal bronchodilation
- Improve exercise tolerance
- Reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations
- Improve health-related quality of life
- Recognize and treat COPD comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, osteoporosis and smoking-related malignancies
- Reduce impairment and disability
- Reduce mortality

### Investigations

- History with particular attention to:​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

  - symptoms and their pattern: dyspnea (insidious at onset and progressive), chronic cough, sputum production, limitations to physical activity
  - degree of shortness of breath and disability, assessed using 1 of the following methods:

    - the modified Medical Research Council’s dyspnea scale (mMRC, see [Table 1](#c0040n00351))​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[4]](#c0040n00334)
    - the [COPD Assessment Test (CAT)](https://www.catestonline.org/): an online questionnaire for people with COPD designed to measure the impact of COPD on a person’s life, and how it changes over time​[[5]](#JonesPWHardingGBerryPEtAl.Developme-8411150B)​[[6]](#JonesPWBrusselleGDalNegroRWEtAl.Pro-8411180C)
  - precipitating factors and triggers: tobacco smoking, heavy exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals, air pollution
  - alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, which has been associated with emphysema, liver disease, panniculitis
  - signs/symptoms that suggest other comorbidities or systemic manifestations such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, skeletal muscle dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, secondary polycythemia, depression, altered nutrition, pneumonia, malignancy, metabolic syndrome
  - previous history of acute exacerbations of COPD: hospitalizations, emergency department visits, use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics
  - impact on daily life
  - social supports available
- Physical examination is relatively insensitive for diagnosis:

  - signs of dyspnea, wheeze
  - late clinical findings: signs of hyperinflation, hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension
- Objective measurements needed to confirm diagnosis and assess severity:

  - spirometry, the gold standard for diagnosis and risk stratification of COPD.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Baseline postbronchodilator FEV1 <80% of the predicted value is necessary to establish the diagnosis along with a decreased FEV1/FVC.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[7]](#c0040n00023)​[[8]](#c0040n00331) Approximately 30% of patients thought to have COPD will have an increase of 12% and >200 mL in FEV1 after salbutamol

    - guidelines have traditionally recommended using an FEV1/FVC <0.7 to diagnose COPD;​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[10]](#Bourbeau_CTS2019) however, a FEV1/FVC less than the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) is more accurate and will avoid overdiagnosing COPD.​[[11]](#CoatesALGrahamBLMcFaddenRGEtAl.Spir-A7829BE4) LLN is the preferred measurement in Canada
  - assessment of lung volumes and carbon monoxide diffusion
  - CBC to assess for polycythemia, which indicates chronic hypoxia or anemia that can worsen dyspnea
  - chest x-ray to rule out lung cancer, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis
  - pulse oximetry ± arterial blood gases if FEV1 <1 L or <40% predicted or SaO2 <92% or clinical signs of respiratory failure or right heart failure​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)
  - alpha1-antitrypsin level if patient <65 years of age presents with COPD, <20 pack-year smoking history or a strong family history of COPD​[[12]](#AntiTrypsin-2D592AF6)
  - elevated eosinophils (>300 cells/mcL in blood [via CBC] or >3% in sputum), which may be a marker for overlapping symptoms of asthma and COPD​[[10]](#Bourbeau_CTS2019)

**Table 1:** Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Questionnaire for Assessing the Severity of Breathlessness​​[[a]](#afn82926)​[[b]](#afn61480)[[2]](#c0040n00020)[[4]](#c0040n00334)

| Grade 0 | I only get breathless with strenuous exercise. | □ |
| Grade 1 | I get short of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill. | □ |
| Grade 2 | I walk slower than people of the same age on the level because of breathlessness, or I have to stop for breath when walking on my own pace on the level. | □ |
| Grade 3 | I stop for breath after walking about 100 metres or after a few minutes on the level. | □ |
| Grade 4 | I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing or undressing. | □ |

[a] Patient can tick only 1 response at a time.

[b] The mMRC questionnaire can be used on follow-up visits to monitor progress or response to therapy. Spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosis of COPD.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Recommend smoking cessation to reduce the risk of developing COPD,​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[13]](#c0040n00026) stop COPD progression​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[14]](#c0040n00024)​[[15]](#c0040n00027)​[[16]](#c0040n00030) and decrease mortality.​[[17]](#c0040n00028) Sustained smoking cessation (≥10 years) is associated with a reduced risk of acute exacerbations, and the risk reduction is proportional to the time the individual is smoke-free (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation).​[[18]](#AuDHBrysonCLChienJWEtAl.TheEffectsO-84123C2F)
- Advise patients to minimize/eliminate exposure to air pollution and occupational dusts and chemicals.​[[19]](#c0040n00332)​[[20]](#c0040n00333)
- Written COPD action plans reduce acute exacerbations and risk of use of urgent care or hospitalization when combined with education and case management. An action plan should not be used alone.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[21]](#HowcroftMWaltersEHWood-BakerRWalter-A782F155)
- A few small studies support the efficacy of oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OCEP) devices in reducing COPD exacerbation severity and improving lung function.​[[22]](#BourbeauJ-2FEB3CAD) Some OCEP devices (e.g., Aerobika) are available in pharmacies. However, recommendations regarding their use have not yet been included in the Canadian guidelines nor in the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD strategy document. Larger scale studies are required.

#### Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Exercise and Education

Pulmonary rehabilitation is a broad therapeutic concept and should be an integral part of patient management by the COPD care team, including Certified Respiratory Educators, nurse navigators, respiratory therapists, pharmacists and other allied health-care providers. It is defined as “comprehensive intervention based on a thorough patient assessment followed by patient-tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, and behavior change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors.”​[[23]](#c0040n00294)

Consider early referral of symptomatic patients to pulmonary rehabilitation programs providing respiratory, physical and occupational therapy; exercise conditioning; nutritional assistance; and psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation. Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a limited resource, patients benefit in all stages of COPD.​[[23]](#c0040n00294)​[[24]](#c0040n00031)​[[25]](#c0040n00032) After an acute exacerbation, recommend initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation within 4 weeks to reduce the chances of further exacerbations.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[26]](#PuhanMAGimeno-SantosECatesCJEtAl.Pu-A785F3B7)

Encourage physical activity to prevent decreased mobility and increased dyspnea.​[[24]](#c0040n00031) Patients with a lower activity level at 1 month after hospital discharge were more likely to be readmitted in the following year.​[[27]](#c0040n00029) Formal exercise programs, with or without use of a pedometer, have been found to improve endurance and quality of life.​[[28]](#WoottonSLNgLWMcKeoughZJEtAl.Ground--841279B4)​[[29]](#MendozaLHortaPEspinozaJEtAl.Pedomet-84129077) Tai chi may improve exercise tolerance and pulmonary function.​[[30]](#Ngai-EF9342DE)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, due to widespread masking and social isolation, AECOPD hospitalizations declined;​[[2]](#c0040n00020) however, this is at the cost of increased physical deconditioning. COPD patients must keep mentally and physically active, as deconditioning limits mobility and effectiveness of treatment.​[[24]](#c0040n00031) All COPD patients should be encouraged to exercise; remind them that it is safe to do so and reiterate the importance of use breathing techniques (e.g., pursed lip breathing).​[[23]](#c0040n00294)

Educate patients and their families to enhance patient outcomes and reduce costs by improving self-management skills and the ability to cope with the illness and health status.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[31]](#c0040n00046)​[[32]](#Lenferin-EF823EEF) The combination of patient education and case management that includes monthly access to a health-care specialist has been shown to reduce hospitalizations; however, patient education alone or case management alone are not recommended methods of reducing the risk of acute exacerbations.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0040n00045) depicts a stepwise approach to COPD management. See [Table 4](#c0040n00361) and [Table 5](#c0040n00362) for the available agents for COPD treatment; care should be taken to avoid prescribing duplicate therapy from the same class.

### COPD Strategies and Guidelines

COPD is a global problem, and national and international bodies are reviewing the evidence and suggesting various management strategies. Guideline development has advanced significantly; precise criteria have been developed for reviewing evidence-based data for guidelines. The Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) produces guidelines​[[1]](#c0040n00021) that are currently awaiting update, but Canadian experts also acknowledge the GOLD COPD strategy.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Furthermore, CTS updated its pharmacotherapy guidelines in 2019.​[[10]](#Bourbeau_CTS2019)

GOLD has evolved its recommendations beyond simply classifying COPD as mild, moderate, severe or very severe based on the progressive impairment of FEV1.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) It now categorizes patients by combining the spirometric classification and/or the number of exacerbations or hospitalizations in the preceding year with a symptomatic assessment (CAT score or mMRC score) to stratify patients as Group A, B, C or D, where D is the most severe.

The CTS and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) have released joint guidelines that assess the available evidence to support treatments and approaches for the prevention of exacerbations and hospitalization.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)

All medications used to treat symptoms in stable COPD also help to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD. An acute exacerbation is a significant event in the life of a COPD patient, often resulting in further decline in function or death. Careful selection of therapy for patients with stable COPD can reduce the risk of requiring additional therapy or hospitalization.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) See [Treatment of Acute Exacerbations of COPD](#c0040n00230) for more information.

### Stable COPD and Prevention of Acute Exacerbations

Optimal bronchodilation should be the main goal of pharmacologic therapy and should aim to improve the patient’s functioning. Bronchodilators, the mainstay of pharmacotherapy, decrease air trapping, improve FEV1, reduce symptoms (e.g., dyspnea), and improve exercise capacity and quality of life in stable COPD and in acute exacerbations of COPD. Even a small improvement in airflow may be of significant clinical benefit in COPD patients with severe obstruction. Inhaled bronchodilators can be used as needed for occasional symptoms or regularly for symptom prevention and/or reduction.

Initial therapy commences with **short-acting** beta2-adrenergic agonists (also known as short-acting beta2 agonists, or SABAs) as needed to relieve dyspnea, which may be supplemented by regular **long-acting bronchodilators**.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[33]](#c0040n00296) Maximum bronchodilation may be obtained with a combination of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs).​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

COPD is characterized by persistent inflammation, even in early disease.​[[1]](#c0040n00021) However, compared to their effect in asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have minimal effect on the neutrophilic response in COPD. In addition, patients regularly using ICS for COPD treatment may be at increased risk of pneumonia.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Furthermore, the TORCH study showed increased mortality with ICS monotherapy.​[[34]](#c0040n00406) The main role of ICS in COPD is in combination with a LABA in moderate to severe disease (see [Combination Inhaled Corticosteroids and Long-Acting Bronchodilators](#c0040n00006)).​[[1]](#c0040n00021)

### Short-Acting Bronchodilators

Recommend PRN use of a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol or terbutaline in all stages of disease severity for immediate symptom relief.​[[1]](#c0040n00021) SABAs have approximately equal efficacy, side effects, onset and duration of action (4–6 hours).​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Recommended doses of short-acting beta2-agonists result in less than maximal bronchodilation; the dose may be doubled or tripled, although tachycardia, tremor and potential hypokalemia must be recognized and monitored.​[[35]](#Emergency_SABA)

The short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) ipratropium has a slower onset of action than inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists but a longer duration of action (up to 8 hours).​[[2]](#c0040n00020) The recommended dose (40 mcg, 3–4 times/day), produces less than maximal bronchodilation and may be doubled or tripled without notable side effects. The role of ipratropium monotherapy is limited because it is less effective than tiotropium​[[36]](#Cheyne-2A342E6A) and has a slower onset of action than salbutamol.

The combination of ipratropium/​salbutamol produces greater and more sustained improvement in FEV1 and a greater degree of bronchodilation with a lower or similar incidence of side effects compared with either drug alone.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) The combination also confers greater improvement in lung function than doubling the dose of either bronchodilator.​[[37]](#c0040n00304)​[[38]](#c0040n00306)​[[39]](#c0040n00438)

Oral beta2-agonists offer few advantages and are associated with an increased incidence of side effects; they have no role in the routine management of COPD.

### Long-Acting Bronchodilators

There are 2 types of long-acting bronchodilators available, **LAMAs** (formerly referred to as long-acting anticholinergics) and **LABAs**. Long-acting bronchodilators can be used in patients with persistent symptoms and moderate to severe airflow obstruction. Studies have shown that LAMAs and LABAs improve lung function and health status while reducing exacerbation rates and dyspnea.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

### Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists

The LAMA tiotropium is a first-line agent for managing persistent symptoms and moderate to severe airflow obstruction, as it decreases exacerbations and hospitalizations.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[40]](#c0040n00300) A single daily 18 mcg dose via a breath-activated DPI or two 2.5 mcg inhalations (total dose of 5 mcg) via SMI gives maximal anticholinergic activity for a full 24 hours.​[[41]](#c0040n00299) When compared with ipratropium, more sustained effects on pulmonary function, activity-related dyspnea, and quality of life, as well as fewer acute exacerbations, were noted.​[[36]](#Cheyne-2A342E6A) When given in combination with pulmonary rehabilitation, tiotropium improved treadmill walking endurance time.​[[42]](#c0040n00335)

The risk of cardiovascular events was extensively reviewed by the FDA and others following initial reports of elevated risk. No increase in risk was found for tiotropium.​[[43]](#c0040n00415)​[[44]](#c0040n00491) However, ipratropium does appear to be associated with an increase in cardiovascular events in a dose dependent manner.​[[45]](#c0040n00493)​[[46]](#c0040n00492)

Glycopyrronium is a rapid-onset LAMA delivered via DPI. It has a faster onset of action than tiotropium. The currently licensed dose is 50 mcg once daily. Phase III studies have established improvement in dyspnea and quality of life and reduced risk of exacerbation compared with placebo; when compared with tiotropium, similar efficacy and safety data were observed.​[[47]](#c0040n00465)​[[48]](#c0040n00466)​[[49]](#c0040n00467) The bronchodilation effect is seen on day 1 of administration. Improvements in exercise endurance and quality of life are seen over time.

The LAMA aclidinium is dosed at 400 mcg twice daily and has effects similar to those of tiotropium and glycopyrronium on lung function.​[[50]](#c0040n00506)​[[51]](#c0040n00507)​[[52]](#c0040n00508)

Umeclidinium is a once daily LAMA delivered via DPI. A Cochrane review found that it reduced the likelihood of developing moderate exacerbations requiring oral steroids and/or antibiotics (NNT = 18); however, a reduction in exacerbations requiring hospitalization was not observed. This therapy also reduced the frequency of rescue inhaler use while improving quality of life, COPD-related symptoms and lung function.​[[53]](#Ni-EF84E3A5)

All LAMAs have been found to reduce the rate of acute exacerbations leading to hospitalization.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[47]](#c0040n00465)​[[48]](#c0040n00466)​[[54]](#NiHSoeZMoeS.AclidiniumBromideForSta-8495EDA4)

### Long-Acting Beta2-agonists

The inhaled LABAs salmeterol and formoterol offer sustained improvements in pulmonary function, dyspnea and quality of life compared with SABAs.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[55]](#c0040n00302) Unlike salmeterol, formoterol has the advantage of rapid onset of bronchodilation (<3 min vs. 20–120 min in COPD) in addition to the 12-hour duration of action.​[[56]](#c0040n00303)​[[57]](#c0040n00439)

Indacaterol and olodaterol are once-daily, ultra-long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists with rapid onset of action. Indacaterol has shown bronchodilation similar to tiotropium, and has been shown in a short-term trial to be noninferior to salmeterol/fluticasone with respect to changes in FEV1 in patients with moderate COPD who were at low risk of exacerbation.​[[58]](#c0040n00468)​[[59]](#c0040n00469)​[[60]](#RossiAVanDerMolenTDelOlmoREtAl.INST-84966676)​[[61]](#GeakeJBDabscheckEJWood-BakerRCatesC-84967021) Olodaterol, only available in combination with a LAMA, is an effective bronchodilator as a single agent, provides similar bronchodilation to formoterol and has shown additive bronchodilation when combined with tiotropium.​[[62]](#FergusonGTFeldmanGJHofbauerPEtAl.Ef-8496E5FB)​[[63]](#KochAPizzichiniEHamiltonAEtAl.LungF-8496F5BA)​[[64]](#ZuWallackRAllenLHernandezGEtAl.Effi-84971471) Indacaterol and olodaterol may be considered for the treatment of COPD patients who either cannot tolerate a muscarinic antagonist due to adverse effects or demonstrate poor adherence with twice-daily LABA regimens.

LABAs have been found to reduce the risk of moderate and severe acute exacerbations compared with placebo and are safe for long-term use.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[65]](#DecramerMLHananiaNALotvallJOEtAl.Th-D98D5BE4) When comparing LAMAs with LABAs, LAMAs appear to be more effective in reducing the incidence of acute exacerbations and hospitalizations.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[66]](#ChongJKarnerCPooleP.TiotropiumVersu-861797F1)

### Combination Long-Acting Bronchodilators (LAMA/LABA)

When selecting bronchodilator therapy, choose LAMA/LABA over ICS/LABA to maximize bronchodilation and reduce incidence of exacerbations.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

For symptom control, offer the combination of a LAMA and LABA if disability persists despite monotherapy; for prevention of acute exacerbations, offer either a LAMA/LABA combination or LAMA monotherapy.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[67]](#FarneHACatesCJ.Long-actingBeta2-ago-ED1E6CDA)​[[68]](#SchlueterMGonzalez-RojasNBaldwinMEt-F63FB4E9) Compared with monotherapy, the combination of LAMA and LABA maximizes bronchodilation and lung deflation, thus improving FEV1 while reducing symptoms and exacerbation rates.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) LAMA/LABA combination is recommended in moderate to severe disease with persistent symptoms, in those with poor health status despite monotherapy with LAMA or LABA, and/or in those with frequent exacerbations (≥2 moderate exacerbations or ≥1 exacerbation requiring hospitalization).​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[10]](#Bourbeau_CTS2019)

Several combination products containing a LAMA and a LABA in a single inhaler are now available (see [Table 2](#COPDProducts)). Studies show an acceptable safety profile and superior bronchodilation of combination products when compared with both placebo and individual components.​[[69]](#c0040n00470)​[[70]](#c0040n00503)​[[71]](#RodrigoGJPlazaV.EfficacyAndSafetyOf-86180D43)​[[72]](#c0040n00504)​[[73]](#NiH-2FED0098) Cardiovascular safety was acceptable in studies up to 52 weeks.​[[70]](#c0040n00503)​[[74]](#c0040n00471)​[[75]](#c0040n00505)

The combination of LAMA/LABA (glycopyrronium/​indacaterol) was compared with ICS/LABA (fluticasone/​salmeterol) in the FLAME study and a Cochrane review.​[[76]](#WedzichaJABanerjiDChapmanKREtAl.Ind-A783F735)​[[77]](#HoritaNGotoAShibataYEtAl.Long-actin-BC81E18A) The LAMA/LABA combination was found to be superior to ICS/LABA in terms of delaying time to first exacerbation as well as decreasing the rate of exacerbations and incidence of pneumonia.​[[76]](#WedzichaJABanerjiDChapmanKREtAl.Ind-A783F735)​[[77]](#HoritaNGotoAShibataYEtAl.Long-actin-BC81E18A)

### Combination Inhaled Corticosteroids and Long-Acting Bronchodilators

Prior to initiating ICS, it is best to assess inhaler technique and ensure optimal bronchodilation using LAMA/LABA.

###### Dual Therapy with ICS/LABA

ICS monotherapy is not recommended in the management of COPD symptoms;​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) however, several ICS/LABA combination products are available in Canada (see [Table 4](#c0040n00361)). The combination of ICS plus LABA may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) ICS/LABA combinations are more effective than either drug alone in terms of exercise endurance, symptom control, lung function and exacerbation rates in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[78]](#c0040n00336)​[[79]](#c0040n00338)​[[80]](#c0040n00396)​[[81]](#c0040n00397) These combinations are especially useful in patients with overlapping asthma and COPD symptoms.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[10]](#Bourbeau_CTS2019)

In comparison with LABA monotherapy, the use of ICS/LABA increases the risk of pneumonia without expected increases in mortality.​[[34]](#c0040n00406)​[[81]](#c0040n00397)​[[82]](#c0040n00486) The risk of pneumonia may be most elevated in regimens using fluticasone (both propionate and furoate). Regimens using budesonide may be associated with a lower risk than fluticasone, although direct comparisons have not been conducted.​[[82]](#c0040n00486)​[[83]](#AaronSD.ManagementAndPreventionOfEx-861A1E8D) Budesonide appears to increase the risk of pneumonia in comparison with placebo.​[[84]](#TriccoACStriflerLVeronikiA-AEtAl.Co-D9904B50)

ICS therapy may also increase the risk of contracting or reactivating tuberculosis.​[[85]](#DongYHChangCHLinWuFLEtAl.UseOfInhal-861C75D2) While less of a concern in Canada, patients at high risk of tuberculosis may warrant closer monitoring and consideration of withdrawal of the ICS when the patient is considered stable (see Tuberculosis). The risk of contracting influenza in patients treated with ICS is unclear; strongly recommend that all patients with COPD receive the annual influenza vaccine (see [Vaccines](#c0040n00229)).​[[85]](#DongYHChangCHLinWuFLEtAl.UseOfInhal-861C75D2)

###### Triple Therapy (ICS/LAMA/LABA)

Due to the risk of adverse effects, experts recommend reserving the use of triple therapy for patients with moderate to severe COPD and repeated exacerbations (≥2 per year or ≥1 requiring hospitalization). In these patients, the use of a LAMA, LABA and ICS may prevent exacerbations and improve lung function.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) See [Table 2](#COPDProducts) for dosing information for ICS/LAMA/LABA inhalers.

Triple therapy has been shown to improve bronchodilation and lung deflation, reduce frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health, and reduce hospitalization compared to monotherapy or dual therapy with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[34]](#c0040n00406)​[[86]](#c0040n00311)​[[87]](#FrithPAThompsonPJRatnavadivelREtAl.-861AB6A2)​[[88]](#Rojas-ReyesMXGarcxedaMoralesOMDenni-A7845A14)

If triple inhaler therapy is required, it is strongly encouraged that SITT (single-inhaler triple therapy) be used due to efficacy, effectiveness and compliance; when triple therapy has been prescribed with combinations of multiple individual inhalers (ICS plus LAMA/LABA or LAMA plus ICS/LABA), compliance has been found to be poor.​[[89]](#SITTvsMITT)​[[90]](#inhaler_adher) The availability of new bronchodilators, review of peripheral blood eosinophils and combination LAMA/LABA therapy may reduce the use of triple therapy.

Consider tapering inhaled corticosteroids in patients with severe to very severe COPD who are otherwise stable. The WISDOM study examined a 12-week tapering withdrawal of inhaled fluticasone in patients with severe or very severe COPD who were also receiving salmeterol and tiotropium. No difference was found in the time to first exacerbation, symptoms or quality of life between subjects who continued inhaled fluticasone and those who were tapered to dual therapy.​[[91]](#MagnussenHDisseBRodriguez-RoisinREt-861B8F30)

###### Eosinophilic COPD

The role of ICS in COPD has been the subject of controversy; major international guidelines now recommend a more judicious use of ICS therapy.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020) However, in a subset of COPD patients, denoted as eosinophilic COPD patients, a more heightened response to ICS therapy has been observed. This is postulated to be due to higher type-2 inflammation in the airways, which can be identified by higher peripheral blood eosinophil counts (measured via CBC).​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

Based on meta-analyses, the following eosinophil thresholds have been suggested:​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[92]](#Harries)

- ≥300 eosinophil cells/mcL: improved outcomes and reduction of exacerbations with ICS therapy
- 150–300 eosinophil cells/mcL: lack of data; unclear if ICS therapy is of benefit
- ≤150 eosinophil cells/mcL: ICS therapy is of little benefit

### Delivery Systems

The choice of delivery device for patients with COPD depends on the patient’s ability to correctly use the device as well as convenience, ease of use and affordability.​[[93]](#c0040n00297)​[[94]](#c0040n00298) Inhaled bronchodilators are delivered via pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with or without a spacer device, dry powder inhaler (DPI), soft mist inhaler (SMI or Respimat) or nebulizer.​[[93]](#c0040n00297) If pMDI technique is inadequate or ineffective, a spacer device is recommended to improve deposition of the medication to the lower respiratory tract and to avoid problems in coordinating the time of inhaler actuation with inhalation. DPIs do not present the problems with hand-breath coordination seen with pMDIs. Appropriate use of pMDIs (with or without spacer devices), DPIs or SMIs provides optimal drug delivery and should be encouraged over nebulizers. Nebulizers may be used in patients who remain symptomatic despite maximal treatment with handheld inhalers.

The proper use of inhalers is not intuitive. Careful instruction and demonstration of correct inhaler technique is essential before therapy is initiated and should be reinforced at each visit. Several studies have found that many people with COPD were in need of technique correction, never received training on their device or could not recall having their technique reassessed by a health-care practitioner.​[[95]](#BryantLBangCChewCEtAl.AdequacyOfInh-8493582F)​[[96]](#LavoriniFMagnanADubusJCEtAl.EffectO-84938B93)​[[97]](#RootmensenGNVanKeimpemaARJansenHMDe-8493B5F3) Observation and correction of technique can help to improve technique for both MDIs and DPIs as well as reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations.​[[98]](#TommeleinEMehuysEVanHeesTEtAl.Effec-8494004B) Various manufacturers of DPIs have been developing their own “trademarked” devices to deliver their proprietary medications; patients and health-care practitioners will need to become familiar with the individual requirements of multiple devices to optimize the clinical benefits.

Long-term adherence to inhaled medications for COPD is poor but improves with less frequent administration (e.g., 1 vs. 2 or more daily doses).​[[99]](#CramerJABradley-KennedyCScaleraA.Tr-84943ACB) Poor adherence is associated with higher rates of hospitalization, lower quality of life and lower productivity.​[[100]](#VanBovenJFChavannesNHVanDerMolenTEt-84947810) Adherence may improve in patients who use one type of inhaler for all medications, but this is not always practical.​[[97]](#RootmensenGNVanKeimpemaARJansenHMDe-8493B5F3)

Initially, there was concern over potentially increased mortality with the SMI formulation based on several meta-analyses and systematic reviews.​[[101]](#SinghSLokeYKEnrightPLEtAl.Mortality-8491C81A)​[[102]](#DongYHLinHHShauWYEtAl.ComparativeSa-84922968)​[[103]](#VerhammeKMAfonsoARomioSStrickerBCBr-8492597F) A large, randomized trial and a systematic review allayed these concerns by demonstrating no increased mortality with tiotropium administered via SMI compared with DPI administration.​[[104]](#WiseRAAnzuetoACottonDEtAl.Tiotropiu-84927C7E)​[[105]](#HalpinDMDahlRHallmannCEtAl.Tiotropi-D98C8C90)

### Oral COPD Therapies

For dosing information related to oral therapies, see [Table 5](#c0040n00362).

### Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) Inhibitors

Roflumilast is an oral medication that suppresses the release of inflammatory mediators through inhibition of cyclic AMP breakdown. It is indicated as add-on therapy with bronchodilators for the maintenance treatment of severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis (history of chronic cough and sputum) in adult patients with a history of frequent exacerbations.​[[106]](#c0040n00417)

Roflumilast has demonstrated a significant improvement in prebronchodilator FEV1 (48–80 mL increase) along with a small reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (8% relative risk reduction), even for patients who were also taking a LABA.​[[107]](#c0040n00418)​[[108]](#c0040n00419)​[[109]](#c0040n00420)​[[110]](#MartinezFJCalverleyPMGoehringUMEtAl-86206490) A Cochrane review found that patients were 23% less likely to experience an exacerbation over the study period (≤1 year) with an NNT of 20; however, quality of life and symptoms scores were not greatly improved.​[[111]](#c0040n00473) Data support addition of roflumilast to bronchodilatory therapy to reduce exacerbations, either before or in addition to introduction of ICS/LABA, particularly in patients with frequent or severe exacerbations.

Roflumilast may be considered for add-on therapy to existing triple therapy (ICS/LAMA/LABA or LAMA + ICS/LABA) for people with COPD who have had at least 1 exacerbation in the past year.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[110]](#MartinezFJCalverleyPMGoehringUMEtAl-86206490)​[[112]](#WedzichaJARabeKFMartinezFJEtAl.Effi-A784F549)

### Methylxanthines

Clinically, theophylline exerts little bronchodilator effect beyond that of optimal inhaled bronchodilators. Due to theophylline’s narrow therapeutic index and complex pharmacokinetics, serum levels should be measured and adjusted to the low therapeutic range (55–85 mcmol/L) to minimize adverse effects.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) Theophylline has significant drug interactions, e.g., its levels may be doubled if the patient stops smoking or with the addition of medications commonly used during acute exacerbations of COPD such as clarithromycin.

Long-acting preparations of theophylline (see [Table 5](#c0040n00362)) may be used in patients with severe symptoms of COPD despite use of triple therapy;​[[1]](#c0040n00021) consult a specialist when a patient reaches this stage of disease.

### Mucolytics

Mucolytics lead to a small reduction in acute exacerbations and are not associated with an increase in adverse events.​[[113]](#cochrane_mucolytics) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic agent with antioxidant properties. The mechanism of action of NAC in COPD is not clearly understood. High-dose NAC (600 mg orally twice daily) may be of benefit in reducing acute exacerbations in people with moderate to severe COPD who have experienced 2 or more exacerbations in the previous 2-year period.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)​[[114]](#ShenYCaiWLeiSZhangZ.EffectOfHighlow-862157AF)​[[115]](#CazzolaMCalzettaLPageCEtAl.Influenc-D992F1BC) The optimal dose of NAC has not been determined. The injectable solution is administered orally, usually diluted in a cola beverage to reduce nausea and vomiting.

### Vitamin D3

One prospective study found supplementation with vitamin D**3** (cholecalciferol) 3 mg (120 000 units) every 2 months helped to reduce the incidence of exacerbations only in patients with low baseline vitamin D levels (<50 nmol/L). Those with higher baseline vitamin D levels did not benefit from supplementation.​[[116]](#MartineauARJamesWYHooperRLEtAl.Vita-8621CF60)​[[117]](#Jolliffe-2D5D6893) Further studies are required to better define the role of vitamin D in COPD.

### Antibiotics

Long-term **macrolide** therapy can help to reduce the number of patients experiencing exacerbations as well as the frequency of exacerbations experienced by each patient. Given a 3- to 12-month prophylactic antibiotic course, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 8.​[[118]](#c0040n00510) For patients with moderate to severe COPD who have experienced ≥1 moderate or severe exacerbation in the previous year while on optimal therapy, consider a long-term course of macrolide antibiotic therapy. For further information, see: [Figure 1](#c0040n00045). The ideal length of therapy has not been established. Consideration needs to be given to the individual patient’s risk of QTc prolongation, risk of ototoxicity including hearing loss, and risk of antibiotic resistance to both the individual and the community.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) Current evidence does not support pulsed antibiotic therapy for prevention of exacerbations; however, intermittent prophylactic therapy (three times weekly) clinically reduced exacerbations in COPD patients.​[[118]](#c0040n00510)

Azithromycin may be effective at preventing exacerbations requiring treatment with both antibiotics and corticosteroids. Patients who are older and who have milder COPD may be more likely to respond to long-term azithromycin therapy. Benefit of exacerbation reduction has not been seen in patients who continue to smoke.​[[119]](#HanMKTayobNMurraySEtAl.PredictorsOf-86951835)

### Biologics

Biologics (e.g., benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) have been approved for use in severe asthma. They have also been studied to evaluate a potential reduction of mucus in COPD; however, to date, there is no biologic approved or found therapeutically efficacious for the treatment of COPD.​[[120]](#Yousuf)

### Immunoglobulin Therapy

Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) often occur secondary to infection and are associated with increased airway inflammation. Some COPD patients may experience frequent AECOPD, even though their treatment has been optimized with standard inhaler therapies. In these patients, adjuvant therapies for specific comorbidities may be required.

Immunoglobulins are defined as “glycoprotein molecules that are secreted by B lymphocytes and plasma cells and play a critical role in the adaptive immune response against many pathogens.”​[[121]](#Unninayar) Patients with inflammatory diseases or immunodeficiencies have been shown to have reduced serum immunoglobulin levels.​[[121]](#Unninayar) Assessment for hypogammaglobulinemia and replacement therapy may be beneficial at reducing AECOPD.​[[121]](#Unninayar) Replacement therapy with immunoglobulin Ig is available and can be provided at various locations (e.g., home or hospital), depending on the route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous).

The 2022 GOLD document states that additional data is required to determine the long-term effects of this therapy.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

### Oxygen Therapy

**Oxygen therapy** reduces the risk of death in select patients. In COPD patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg or SaO2 <88%), long-term oxygen therapy may prolong life by 6–7 years.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Improved survival has been seen only when oxygen is administered for ≥15 hours per day.​[[122]](#c0040n00312) Continuously administered oxygen provides the greatest survival benefit. A patient whose PaO2 is between 55 and 59 mm Hg may benefit from oxygen therapy if there is evidence of bilateral ankle edema, cor pulmonale or a hematocrit greater than 56%.​[[1]](#c0040n00021) Oxygen therapy is usually administered via Venturi facemask or nasal prongs at a flow rate sufficient to produce a resting PaO2 between 65 and 80 mm Hg. Flow rates are often increased by 1 or 2 L/min during exercise and sleep. If hypoventilation (PaCO2 >45 mm Hg) is present, the titration of oxygen may worsen hypercarbic hypoxia; thus, monitoring is advised.

### Vaccines

Ensuring COPD patients have currently recommended vaccines will help to reduce their risk of infection and exacerbation. It is crucial to ensure that COPD patients receive all of their age-appropriate vaccinations (e.g., herpes zoster, Tdap/dTap [diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis]) and are up to date with the advised COVID-19 vaccine doses (primary series and boosters).​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

Vaccinate against influenza annually, early in the fall. Influenza vaccine reduces exacerbations and death in patients with COPD (see Influenza).​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[123]](#c0040n00313)​[[124]](#c0040n00314)

Recommend pneumococcal vaccination to all patients with COPD who have no contraindications.​[[125]](#NationalAdvisoryCommitteeOnImmuniza-86223ED6) Efficacy studies of pneumococcal vaccine in patients with COPD yield conflicting results;​[[126]](#c0040n00337)​[[127]](#c0040n00315) however, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended because patients with COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization and mortality from pneumonia.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[125]](#NationalAdvisoryCommitteeOnImmuniza-86223ED6) Consider repeating the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneu-P-23) as a one-time booster in high-risk patients (COPD plus ≥1 other comorbidity) in 5 years.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[125]](#NationalAdvisoryCommitteeOnImmuniza-86223ED6) Additional boosters are not recommended.​[[125]](#NationalAdvisoryCommitteeOnImmuniza-86223ED6)

One small study suggests an additive protective effect against acute exacerbations in COPD patients who received both the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines compared with receipt of influenza vaccine alone.​[[128]](#FurumotoAOhkusaYChenMEtAl.AdditiveE-86229B87) Further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

For more information related to vaccines in patients with COPD, consult the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-immunization-guide.html).

### Treatment of Acute Exacerbations of COPD

COPD exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as a patient’s disease worsens. The strongest predictor of future exacerbations and mortality is a prior history of exacerbation, irrespective of disease severity. This suggests that the “frequent exacerbator” is a distinct subgroup (or phenotype) of patients who could be identified and targeted with specific exacerbation-prevention strategies.​[[129]](#c0040n00474)​[[130]](#YangHXiangPZhangEEtAl.PredictorsOfE-848E4CC1) Several other factors are associated with exacerbations and increased mortality: female gender, advanced age, low FEV1, high number of comorbidities and low physical activity.​[[129]](#c0040n00474)​[[131]](#MoyMLTeylanMWestonNAGagnonDRGarshic-848FA1F0)​[[132]](#SinganayagamASchembriSChalmersJD.Pr-848FD1F8)​[[133]](#BowlerRPKimVReganEEtAl.PredictionOf-84904537)​[[134]](#SmithMCWrobelJP.EpidemiologyAndClin-84907BCE) Cold weather is associated with an increase in the number of patients experiencing acute exacerbations.​[[135]](#AlmagroPHernandezCMartinez-CamborPE-8490D3BC)​[[136]](#TsengC-MChenY-TOuS-MEtAl.TheEffectO-84910086) Two-thirds of exacerbations are related to acute respiratory infections, while one-third have no clear cause.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) A combination of prevention of infectious diseases (e.g., appropriate immunization) and good symptomatic control may help to prevent exacerbations.

Acute exacerbations are the most frequent cause of medical visits, hospital admissions and death among COPD patients. Characterized by sustained worsening of dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production, acute exacerbations of COPD contribute to the accelerated rate of decline in lung function.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) In addition, acute exacerbations lead to an increase in the use of maintenance medications and/or initiation of systemic corticosteroids and/or inhaled oxygen.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020) In acute exacerbations of COPD, bronchodilation is optimized by increasing the dose and/or frequency of existing bronchodilator treatment.​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Treat dyspnea with a **SABA** and ipratropium. In addition to optimized bronchodilator therapy, patients with purulent acute exacerbations benefit from antibiotics.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020) Severe COPD patients gain additional benefit from a short course of systemic corticosteroids.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)

### Systemic Corticosteroids

**Oral** corticosteroids (see [Table 5](#c0040n00362)) improve lung function and shorten length of hospital stay in all patients and reduce risk of early relapse or hospitalization for subsequent acute exacerbations.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE) They should be given within 30 days of an acute exacerbation to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. Administration beyond 30 days is not recommended.​[[9]](#CrinerGJBourbeauJDiekemperRLEtAl.Pr-848DDFDE)

A 5-day course of oral prednisone 30–40 mg/day or equivalent is sufficient and has shown outcomes comparable to a 10- to 14-day course.​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[137]](#c0040n00485)​[[138]](#WaltersJATanDJWhiteCJEtAl.Different-862377AA) Tapering is unnecessary for oral corticosteroid courses that last <2 weeks. There is no role for oral corticosteroid maintenance therapy for patients with COPD. There is no advantage to using IV corticosteroids.

### Antibiotics

Viruses are the most common infectious agents in exacerbations. Consider rapid virology and antivirals for influenza during influenza season (see Influenza). Routine use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD is not recommended because of inconsistent study results in nonsevere exacerbations and concerns about increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.​[[139]](#c0040n00522) Antibiotics are indicated in all patients with severe exacerbations requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or if the exacerbation is accompanied by 2–3 of the following cardinal signs: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume or increased sputum purulence (see [Table 3](#c0040n00033)).​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[140]](#c0040n00318)

The common bacterial pathogens causing acute exacerbations of COPD are *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae* and Moraxella catarrhalis.​[[1]](#c0040n00021)​[[2]](#c0040n00020)​[[141]](#c0040n00319) In complicated patients, *Klebsiella* species and other gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa may also be involved.​[[141]](#c0040n00319)

Empiric choice of an antibiotic should take into account individual risk stratification, previous antibiotic use and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the area (see [Table 3](#c0040n00033)). Consider a change in antibiotic class if the same class has been used within the previous 3 months. Re-evaluate patients who do not respond within 24–36 hours. See [Table 6](#c0040n00041) for antibiotic dosing information.

**Table 3:** Empiric Antibiotic Therapy for Outpatient Acute Exacerbation of COPD

| Symptoms | Risk Factors | Probable Pathogens | Antibiotic of First Choice​[a]​[b] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| At least 2 of: Increased sputum purulence Increased sputum volume Worsening dyspnea | <4 exacerbations in the past year | Haemophilus spp. Moraxella catarrhalis Streptococcus pneumoniae | Amoxicillin × 5–7 days Doxycycline × 5–7 days Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim × 5–7 days |
| ≥4 exacerbations in the past year or Failure of 1 of the agents listed above​ [b] or Antibiotics in the past 3 months​ [b] | Organisms listed above plus Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas spp. Note: in these cases, there is a higher probability of resistance | Preferred: Amoxicillin clavulanate × 5–10 days Cefuroxime axetil × 5–10 days Levofloxacin × 5 days Alternative: Azithromycin × 3 days Clarithromycin × 5–10 days |

[a] See [Table 6](#c0040n00041) for dosing information

[b] If an antibiotic has been used within the past 3 months *or* if treatment failure occurs (clinical deterioration after 72 h of antibiotic therapy *or* no symptom improvement after completion of antibiotic therapy), use an antibiotic from a different therapeutic class.

### Oxygen Therapy

Arterial blood gas determination is the gold standard for assessing oxygenation and ventilation during an exacerbation.

### Therapeutic Tips

- To screen for undiagnosed COPD, perform spirometry with bronchodilator assessment in those:​[[7]](#c0040n00023)

  - who smoke and are ≥35 years of age
  - who have previously smoked and had a ≥20 pack-year (number of packs smoked per day х number of years smoked) history of smoking, whether or not the patient complains of symptoms
  - with recurrent or chronic respiratory symptoms including cough and breathlessness on exertion
  - with a family history of COPD
  - who have significant occupational exposure to respiratory irritants
- Ensure vaccines are up to date.
- Review inhaler technique at each visit.
- Promote smoking cessation at each visit (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation).
- Refer patients to pulmonary rehabilitation (if available) or to local senior or cardiac exercise programs.
- Encourage physical activity to prevent a cycle of decreasing mobility and increasing dyspnea.
- Encourage adherence to therapy by using a stepwise approach to treatment with positive reinforcement at all stages.
- Ensure patient and family are aware of warning signs of a COPD exacerbation and have a written action plan for initial management.
- Recommend helplines including those such as the Canadian Lung Association (new patient information number 1-866-717-COPD [2673]).
