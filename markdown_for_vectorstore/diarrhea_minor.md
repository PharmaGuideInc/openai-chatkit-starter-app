### Introduction

Diarrhea is the unusually frequent excretion of watery stools. It is associated with loss of electrolytes and loss of fecal matter at a rate of >200 g/24 hours.​[[1]](#psc1032n1001) A more practical working definition is ≥3 loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based on an individual baseline.​[[2]](#88260A5B) Decreased fluid absorption or increased fluid secretion can lead to dehydration, which can ultimately lead to death, particularly in children and the elderly.

Although temporal definitions vary, diarrhea can be classified as acute (<14 days in duration), persistent (>14 days in duration) or chronic (>28 days in duration).​[[3]](#refitem-132211-99912068)​[[4]](#refitem-1322141-99925707)

Diarrhea is believed to be underreported.​[[5]](#psc1032n1002) The incidence of acute diarrhea in industrialized countries is approximately 0.5–2 episodes per person yearly and considerably higher in developing and underdeveloped countries.​[[6]](#88265049) In older children, adolescents and adults, diarrhea accounts for about 2.8 billion episodes annually worldwide.​[[7]](#882663C5) Diarrhea is common in the pediatric population; statistics indicate that children <5 years experience 1.3–2.7 episodes of diarrhea yearly.​[[8]](#psc1032n1003) Eighteen percent of all deaths in children under 5 years of age are attributed to diarrhea and 78% of those deaths occur in African and Southeast Asian regions. In this age group, diarrhea is the second-leading cause of death, following pneumonia.​[[9]](#88269C2E) As a result, the integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea hopes to reduce death from diarrhea in children under 5 years of age to <1 in 1000 by 2025.​[[10]](#8826D4FF)

Aside from dehydration, complications of diarrhea include electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, vascular collapse, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse. Diarrhea often results in a decreased ability to perform daily activities.

### Pathophysiology

Chronic diarrhea is often indicative of a disorder of the brain-gut axis, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal diseases with underlying inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) are also prevalent. Food intolerances and sensitivities, ischemic colitis, microscopic colitis, GI infections, radiation or chemotherapy, and maldigestion or malabsorption of fat or carbohydrates (celiac disease, lactose intolerance) can also be responsible for chronic diarrhea. Foods that contain large amounts of sorbitol or mannitol can cause osmotic diarrhea.​[[11]](#psc1032n1004)

The most common cause of acute diarrhea is viral infection.​[[12]](#refitem-1322113-9C946FBF) Acute childhood diarrheal pathogens are transmitted by close contact and in particular the oral-fecal route. Child-care settings are a common place for acquiring infectious diarrhea where typical infectious viral agents include:​[[11]](#psc1032n1004)

- Rotavirus—causes severe diarrhea, predominantly affects infants and children 4 months–2 years of age but also occurs in adults. Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis among children worldwide.​[[13]](#psc1032n1006)
- Norwalk-like virus—responsible for a milder form of diarrhea affecting older children and adults
- Adenovirus
- Calicivirus

Bacteria and less commonly parasites (e.g., Giardia) are also implicated in causing diarrhea. When bacteria are involved, it may be due to strains such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella or Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli. The symptoms accompanying a bacterial infection are generally more severe than a viral infection, i.e., bloody stools, fever.

Drugs are also a common cause of diarrhea (see [Table 1](#psc1032n00004)). In particular, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and erythromycins are implicated in altering the bacterial flora of the gut, resulting in diarrhea. This usually occurs 2–3 days after starting the antibiotic and resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. An uncommon but potentially serious result of antibiotics use is Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea. While antibiotic use is not a prerequisite to C. difficile–associated diarrhea, it is the most common cause. The agents most often implicated are clindamycin, ampicillin and the cephalosporins,​[[14]](#psc1032n1007) although any antimicrobial agent can cause it, including those used to treat it. The condition can occur in anyone who has received an antibiotic within the previous 3 months and is characterized by significant loss of fluid, fever and abdominal pain. C. difficile infections necessitate treatment; refer to *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Diarrhea for further discussion.

**Abbreviations:**

HIV
:   human immunodeficiency virus

NSAID
:   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug

SSRI

Other causes of diarrhea include nervousness or anxiety, gastrointestinal or pancreatic tumours, diabetes mellitus, opioid withdrawal, rapid increase of fibre in the diet, enteral nutritional supplements, deficiencies of specific nutrients such as vitamin A and zinc,​[[18]](#psc1032n1010) excesses of specific nutrients such as vitamin C and magnesium,​[[1]](#psc1032n1001)​[[11]](#psc1032n1004) certain metals, organic toxins and plant products (e.g., arsenic, insecticides, mushroom toxins, caffeine).​[[19]](#88283F15)

### Goals of Therapy

- Determine the specific etiology where possible and treat appropriately
- Decrease the symptoms and re-establish normal stools
- Avoid and treat complications such as dehydration
- Identify red flags (see [Table 2](#psc1032n00009)) and cases requiring further diagnostic testing

### Patient Assessment

For patients presenting with diarrhea, a thorough patient history may be helpful in elucidating the underlying cause. This can include an inquiry regarding travel and animal exposure, sources of water (e.g., well water), recent food consumption, history of past diarrheal episodes, recent antibiotic use, medical conditions (e.g., immunocompromised) and time spent in long-term care or day-care facilities.​[[20]](#refitem-132213-9C257CDD)

Aside from frequent loose stools, symptoms of infectious diarrhea may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills and malaise. Presence of red flags (see [Table 2](#psc1032n00009)) requires further detailed patient assessment. A physical exam will aid in assessing the degree of dehydration (see [Table 3](#psc1032n00010)). Decreased skin turgor becomes evident in moderate to severe dehydration (see [Figure 1](#psc1032n00011)).

Question patients with repeated episodes of diarrhea about any relationship between symptoms and consumption of dairy or grain products to rule out lactose or gluten intolerance (see Special Diets).

**Table 2:** Red Flag Signs and Symptoms in Persons with Diarrhea

| Blood or abnormal mucus in stool Extensive abdominal cramping or pain Fever >38.5˚C Frail elderly Immunocompromised (e.g., HIV infection, immunosuppressants) Persistent or chronic diarrhea Persistent vomiting for >4 h Pregnancy Presence of chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart failure, kidney dysfunction) Recent use of antibiotics particularly those associated with Clostridioides difficile colitis (e.g., clindamycin, ampicillin, cephalosporins) Severe diarrhea (>6 unformed stools per day for >48 h) Signs or symptoms of debilitating dehydration (see Table 3 and Figure 1 ) Weight loss due to diarrhea Worsening diarrhea Young age (<2 y) |

An assessment and management plan for patients suffering from diarrhea not related to travel is illustrated in [Figure 2](#psc1032n00012).

### Prevention

### Nonpharmacologic Preventative Measures

- Encourage handwashing after going to the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing and eating food. Transmission of GI infections in the child-care setting is reduced significantly if infection control procedures are followed. High compliance with handwashing decreases episodes of diarrhea by 66%.​[[23]](#refitem-1322121-9C2952DE)
- Suggest avoidance of lactose-containing products if lactose intolerance is suspected or diagnosed.
- Suggest avoidance of gluten-containing products if celiac disease is diagnosed.
- Encourage maintenance of a diet diary to uncover food intolerances or sensitivities and consider an elimination diet to see if improvement of symptoms occurs.
- Follow infection prevention and control measures of facility (e.g., hospital, nursing home) if providing care for C. difficile–infected patients. Patients should be provided with a private room and dedicated toilet; patients are encouraged to wash hands and shower frequently to reduce spore burden. Attending staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns and wash hands with soap and water after providing care.​[[24]](#refitem-1322125-9D1A08FA)
- Prevent food poisoning by encouraging safe food handling procedures (see *What can you do to prevent diarrhea from infections or food poisoning?* in Diarrhea—What You Need to Know).​[[25]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1014)

### Pharmacologic Preventative Measures

Two vaccines are available to protect against rotavirus infection (see [Table 8](#d2e1999)).​[[26]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1016)​[[27]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1017)

Probiotics are live microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) that exert a beneficial effect by improving the balance of the host's intestinal flora.​[[28]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1018)​[[29]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1019) Most probiotics appear relatively safe,​[[30]](#diarrhea_minor--882A6467) but should be used cautiously in patients who are immunosuppressed or have a badly damaged GI tract.​[[28]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1018) There are few well-designed clinical trials of the use of probiotics to prevent or treat diarrhea; however, some probiotic strains and products may provide some benefit:

- The Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (e.g., Culterelle, Digestive Care Travel Probiotic) may reduce the duration of diarrhea due to rotavirus​[[29]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1019) and decrease the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.​[[31]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1020)​[[32]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1021)
- Saccharomyces boulardii (e.g., Florastor) has been effective for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children as well as prevention of recurrence of C. difficile diarrhea in adults.​[[33]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1026) This effectiveness does not extend to elderly, hospitalized patients.​[[34]](#diarrhea_minor--8828EEA2)​[[35]](#diarrhea_minor--8828F743)​[[36]](#diarrhea_minor--88290029) It is generally well tolerated; however, it can cause fungemia, particularly in immunocompromised patients.​[[33]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1026)​[[37]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1023)​[[38]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1024)​[[39]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1025)​[[40]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1027)​[[41]](#diarrhea_minor--88293770)
- The combination of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and *Lactobacillus casei Defensis* (e.g., DanActive) may be helpful in reducing severity of acute diarrhea in infants and young children.​[[42]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01147)​[[43]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01148)​[[44]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01149) It may also prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by C. difficile in hospitalized adults.​[[42]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01147)​[[43]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01148)​[[44]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n01149)
- Administering a daily dose of fermented milk combining Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and *L. casei* (e.g., Bio K) is another effective option for preventing antibiotic- and *C. difficile*–associated diarrhea.​[[45]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1028)​[[46]](#diarrhea_minor--8829B46E)
- Daily administration of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (e.g., Bio-Gaia) or Lactobacillus plantarum 299v were also shown to be effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.​[[47]](#diarrhea_minor--882A0515)​[[48]](#diarrhea_minor--882A0CD7) Enteral administration of L. plantarum 299v (e.g., Digestive Care Daily Probiotic, GoodBelly Probiotic, Tuzen, UltraFlora Intensive Care) was also shown to decrease colonization by C. difficile in critically ill patients.​[[49]](#diarrhea_minor--882A34B9)
- Dairy products and many commercially available probiotics may contain organisms that, unlike L. rhamnosus strain GG, have not been shown to survive in the human GI tract.​[[28]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1018) Yogourt and kefir, in particular, have not been shown to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.​[[50]](#diarrhea_minor--882AACC9)​[[51]](#diarrhea_minor--882AB62E)

Despite this heterogeneity, the overall evidence suggests there may be a protective effect of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.​[[31]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1020) Products may contain microorganisms not listed on the label or contain quantities of microorganisms other than that listed.​[[52]](#diarrhea_minor--psc1032n1029) Product standardization can also be a problem. As a result, the health benefits of one strain cannot be extrapolated to probiotics in general, particularly those of unknown strain composition. A clinical guide to probiotic products in Canada is available at [www.probioticchart.ca](http://www.probioticchart.ca/PBCAdultHealth.html?utm_source=adult_ind&utm_medium=civ&utm_campaign=CDN_CHART).

Rehydration and maintaining electrolyte balance are the cornerstones of therapy for diarrhea.​[[53]](#psc1032n1030) Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) can treat the majority of patients with diarrhea as well as prevent most diarrhea-related complications.​[[8]](#psc1032n1003) Oral rehydration solution (ORS) utilizes the sodium/glucose–coupled absorption mechanism in the small intestine.​[[54]](#psc1032n1031) ORS is composed of sodium and glucose in the concentration and osmolarity of the luminal fluid. It is recommended by the WHO and should be used early, particularly when treating children and the elderly. Diarrhea is the second-leading cause of child deaths with 1.9 million children dying yearly, mainly from dehydration.​[[55]](#psc1032n1032) The WHO along with UNICEF currently advocate the use of a new ORS formulation that has a decreased osmolarity of 245 mOsm/L compared with an osmolarity of 311 mOsm/L in the previous formulation. This new formulation was recommended in 2002 and has decreased concentrations of glucose and sodium chloride. Studies have shown that a reduced-osmolarity solution decreases stool output by 20%, reduces vomiting by 30% and decreases the need for IV therapy by about 30%.​[[56]](#psc1032n1033)​[[57]](#psc1032n1034) The WHO formula for ORS is presented in [Table 4](#psc1032n00018) as are those of the commercially available Gastrolyte, Pedialyte and Hydralyte.​[[58]](#psc1032n1037)​[[59]](#psc1032n1038) It should be noted that liquid Hydralyte can be stored in the refrigerator for 30 days once opened compared with 24 and 48 hours for Gastrolyte and Pedialyte, respectively. Home­made ORS can also be used although this is discouraged because mixing errors often occur. Examples of homemade ORS recipes are described in [Table 5](#recipes).

ORT is contraindicated in the following instances:​[[60]](#psc1032n1036)

- Protracted vomiting despite small frequent feedings
- Worsening diarrhea and an inability to keep up with losses
- Stupor or coma
- Intestinal ileus

Rapid refeeding with age-appropriate foods should immediately follow rehydration.​[[53]](#psc1032n1030) Withholding food for bowel rest, formula dilution and systematic elimination of lactose are no longer standard recommendations.

**Table 4:** Composition of Oral Rehydration Solution Preparations

| Component | WHO | Gastrolyte | Pedialyte​[a] | Hydralyte |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sodium (mmol/L) | 75 | 60 | 45 | 45 |
| Potassium (mmol/L) | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| Chloride (mmol/L) | 65 | 60 | 35 | 45 |

|  | Ingredients | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recipe #1 | Fruit juice Honey (pasteurized) Salt Baking soda | 240 mL (1 cup) 2.5 mL (one-half teaspoonful) 0.5 mL (one-eighth teaspoonful) 1 mL (one-quarter teaspoonful) |
| Recipe #2 | Purified water Salt Sugar | 1 L (4 and one-quarter cups) 2.5 mL (one-half teaspoonful) 30 mL (6 teaspoonfuls) |

### Children

In most cases, diarrhea in children is self-limiting and non-life-threatening. However, this population can be more susceptible to the adverse consequences of dehydration and should be monitored closely.

The treatment of childhood diarrhea focuses on correcting dehydration with ORT. Commercial oral rehydration solutions are readily available, effective and safe, but they are often underutilized.​[[12]](#refitem-1322113-9C946FBF)​[[53]](#psc1032n1030) Under­utilization may be due to the inconvenience of administration, unacceptable taste or a preference for IV versus oral rehydration. While fruit juices have not traditionally been recommended for rehydration due to concerns they may cause osmotic diarrhea, there is evidence that oral rehydration with half-diluted apple juice followed by preferred fluids can be considered for children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.​[[63]](#refitem-1362161-1F796DBB)

Breastfeeding should be continued during episodes of diarrhea,​[[20]](#refitem-132213-9C257CDD)​[[53]](#psc1032n1030) and ORS should be offered. If a child is not being breastfed, age-appropriate foods should be given as well as ORS as described in [Table 6](#psc1032n00022). ORT should start as soon as diarrhea begins and continue until diarrhea is less frequent.

**Table 6:** Administration of Oral Rehydration Solution to Non-breastfed Infants​[[21]](#psc1032n1011)

| Age of Child | Amount of Oral Rehydration Solution to Give​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| 0–6 months | 30–90 mL every hour |
| 6–24 months | 90–125 mL every hour |
| >2 y | 125–250 mL every hour |

[a] Alternatively, the recommended fluid intake can be calculated: 15 mL/kg/hour (or 60 mL/kg over a 4-hour period).​[[64]](#refitem-1322120-9C8DE771)

Even if a child refuses ORS by the cup or bottle, the solution is to be given by a medicine dropper or small teaspoon. If vomiting occurs, ORS should be continued with a spoon, giving 15 mL every 10–15 minutes until vomiting stops, then resuming with the regular amount (see [Table 6](#psc1032n00022)). If vomiting does not stop after 4–6 hours, the child should undergo further assessment.

Early refeeding should begin within 6 hours of beginning ORS. For infants who are formula-fed, start with small, frequent feedings of the child's usual formula. If the diarrhea persists for 2 days, switch to a soy-based or lactose-free formula as lactose intolerance may be suspected.​[[60]](#psc1032n1036)

For older children, early refeeding with age-appropriate, previously tolerated foods is recommended.​[[53]](#psc1032n1030)​[[60]](#psc1032n1036) After 24–48 hours, the child's normal diet can resume. It may take 7–10 days for stools to become completely formed. Restricting a child to a complex carbohydrate diet (e.g., BRATT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, tea and toast) is inappropriate.​[[65]](#psc1032n1044)

For dehydrating, persistent diarrhea, the use of hypo-osmolar ORS (e.g., the new WHO ORS, Gastrolyte, Pedialyte, Hydralyte) is beneficial and superior to the older iso-osmolar WHO ORS (see [Table 4](#psc1032n00018)).​[[66]](#psc1032n1045) Hypo-osmolar ORS results in a shorter period of diarrhea, less stool output and less need for maintenance therapy.

In addition to hypo-osmolar ORS, the WHO and UNICEF recommend supplementation with zinc 20 mg daily for 10–14 days for infants >6 months of age and 10 mg per day for infants <6 months of age. Zinc supplementation decreases both the severity and the duration of acute or persistent diarrhea in children.​[[67]](#refitem-1362163-1F7C5A48)​[[68]](#psc1032n1049)​[[69]](#psc1032n1050) Supplementing with a combination of micronutrients and vitamins is not superior to zinc alone.​[[70]](#89B32BF4) The addition of zinc and prebiotics to ORS limits the duration of diarrhea in children.​[[71]](#89B357EC)

In 2015, a flocked swab for rectal use was developed as a point-of-care tool to quickly and effectively determine whether certain antibiotics would be useful in treating pathogens that cause diarrhea in infants and children in developing countries.​[[72]](#refitem-1332170-9A0B72B5) They discovered that, in a third of the children in the study, there was a treatable pathogen present, yet stools contained no blood. Early treatment may decrease the permanent damage (i.e., cognitive delay, stunted growth, decreased productivity in adulthood or death) that can be caused by infection. Their place in therapy in Canada is yet to be determined.

There are also studies emerging for candidate vaccines against Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. that show promise in improving the burden of enteric infections in children.​[[73]](#refitem-1332171-9A0C0C74)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Antidiarrheal medications are indicated for relief of debilitating symptoms that accompany diarrheal illness. Select agents useful in the management of diarrhea are described in [Table 9](#d2e2571).

For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for diarrhea, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Diarrhea.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antidiarrheals.

Other pharmacologic therapies for diarrhea include:

- Cholestyramine: useful in treatment of bile acid-induced diarrhea​[[1]](#psc1032n1001)
- **Antibiotics**:
  - Fidaxomicin, vancomycin, **oral** metronidazole: useful in treatment of diarrhea due to *C. difficile*​[[24]](#refitem-1322125-9D1A08FA)​[[74]](#psc1032n01151)
  - Ciprofloxacin: for treatment of acute diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic E. coli and Shigella​[[12]](#refitem-1322113-9C946FBF)
  - Azithromycin: for treatment of dysentery and sepsis due to Campylobacter​[[12]](#refitem-1322113-9C946FBF)
- **Opioids**:
  - Codeine: doses necessary for antidiarrheal effect may not be safely attainable with nonprescription products and may result in acetaminophen toxicity
  - Diphenoxylate **with atropine**: less effective than loperamide​[[75]](#psc1032n1052)
- Clonidine: effective against diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal and diabetic autonomic neuropathy​[[1]](#psc1032n1001)
- **Somatostatin analogues**:
  - Octreotide: useful in treatment of diarrhea due to chemotherapy, short bowel syndrome, neuroendocrine tumours, AIDS-associated diarrhea and other chronic diarrhea not responding to standard treatment​[[76]](#psc1032n1053)​[[77]](#psc1032n1055)
  - Lanreotide: has been used safely in a small trial of patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea; clinically meaningful improvements were found in overall quality of life with a decrease in the mean number of stools per day (5.7 at baseline to 3.7 after 56 days)​[[78]](#refitem-13221751-99F55424)

### Pregnancy

Acute diarrhea in pregnancy is mainly due to viral or bacterial causes and is usually self-limiting. Maintenance of fluid intake is important. **Bulking agents** may be of use, and systemic agents such as loperamide should be reserved for severe cases when the risk of dehydration outweighs the risk of the drug used.​[[79]](#psc1032n1056)

### Elderly

The elderly are particularly susceptible to dehydration due to diarrhea. Nursing homes are similar to child-care settings where pathogens are spread by the oral-fecal route. Prompt rehydration is essential to avoid damage to vital organs.

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 7](#psc1032n00031) provides a monitoring plan framework that should be individualized.

**Table 7:** Monitoring of Therapy for Diarrhea

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loose, watery stools | Patient: regularly as long as symptoms persist. Health-care practitioner: ask for symptom report; call patient within 48 h to see if symptoms have resolved. | Resolution of symptoms. Return to usual bowel evacuation pattern. | Antidiarrheal medications may be necessary within first 2 days to alleviate symptoms. If symptoms persist beyond 48 h, seek medical attention. |
| Signs and symptoms of dehydration (see Table 3 ) | Patient: continually. | No signs of dehydration. | If signs of dehydration (see Table 3 and Figure 1 ) occur despite oral rehydration therapy, reassess. |
| Fever or blood in stools | Patient: regularly as long as symptoms persist. | No fever; no blood in stools. | Reassess if this occurs. |
