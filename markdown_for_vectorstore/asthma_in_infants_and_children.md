### Introduction

According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), asthma is a heterogeneous disease of the airways characterized by chronic airway inflammation and reversible airway obstruction. Typically there is airway hyperresponsiveness to a certain stimuli.​[[1]](#c0039n00315) Patients may experience recurrent episodes of cough, wheezing, dyspnea and chest tightness as well as airflow obstruction; these episodes may vary in duration and intensity.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[2]](#c0039n00297)

This chapter focuses on the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of asthma in infants and children <18 years of age. While the new GINA guidelines have encouraged similar pharmacologic management of adults and children >12 years, there remain important differences in the day-to-day management of young children and adolescents that should be highlighted. These nuances in care are discussed in this chapter. For information regarding asthma in adults, see Asthma in Adults.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent cough, wheeze or shortness of breath that interferes with daytime activities, exercise, school attendance, growth and development, or sleep
- Prevent exacerbations requiring emergency room visits, hospitalizations or systemic corticosteroids
- Reduce use of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) for symptom relief to ≤2 doses/week​[[3]](#CTS_mild)
- Achieve normal measures of pulmonary function, e.g., forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in those capable of performing the tests
- Avoid/minimize medication side effects

### Investigations

- Diagnosis of asthma in children <6 years of age depends largely on history and physical examination, since objective measures of airway reactivity using spirometry are not well standardized or easily performed in younger children​[[2]](#c0039n00297)
- Novel diagnostics for the preschool age are showing promising results (e.g., impulse oscillometry uses sound waves to measure airway resistance while the child quietly breathes into a tube)​[[4]](#impulseOscillometry)​[[5]](#XepapadakiPAdachiYPozoBelt)
- History:

  - evidence suggesting airway obstruction and hyperreactivity may include paroxysmal cough, chest tightness or wheeze that limits activities, cough that is worse at night, and cough of longer duration (2–3 wk) or of greater severity than usual for a typical upper respiratory tract infection
  - evidence of associated genetically linked allergic disorders, e.g., atopic dermatitis, proven food or inhalant allergies (anaphylaxis reaction), or positive family history of asthma or atopy
  - past history of admission to hospital due to bronchiolitis (over 2.5–fold increased risk of future asthma in infants with RSV bronchiolitis)​[[6]](#c0039n00368)​[[7]](#BalekianDSLinnemannRWHasegawa)
  - rule out features that suggest the cough or respiratory concern is related to conditions other than asthma:

    - wheeze or cough of a sudden onset in a previously well younger child could also be due to aspiration of a foreign body
    - associated swallowing difficulties or choking, e.g., swallowing dysfunction,​[[8]](#AdilEAlShemariHKacprowiczAEtAl.Eval-9D3B4F91) excessive gastroesophageal reflux,​[[9]](#DecalmerSStovoldRHoughtonLAEtAl.Chr-9D3D25D6)​[[10]](#LangJEHossainJHolbrookJTEtAl.Gastro-9D3D1422) or congenital malformations of the airway and/or esophagus
    - associated evidence of malabsorption or failure to thrive, e.g., cystic fibrosis
    - chronic rhinitis, recurrent otitis media or sinusitis, e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia or immune system disorders
    - shortness of breath or stridor that is associated with weak voice and is absent at night, e.g., vocal cord dysfunction​[[11]](#HseuASandlerMEricsonDEtAl.Paradoxic-9D3DCD46)​[[12]](#MatrkaL.ParadoxicVocalFoldMovementD-9D3DE905)​[[13]](#c0039n00082)
- Physical examination:

  - intercostal retractions, hyperexpansion of thorax, greatly diminished breath sounds, or wheezing during normal breathing or forced exhalation
  - presence of atopic dermatitis and/or allergic rhinitis (increased nasal secretions, pale/blue swollen nasal turbinates) suggests that the child is prone to allergic diseases like asthma
  - nasal polyps in a prepubertal child or finger clubbing in an individual of any age, as these would suggest that the primary cause of the cough is more likely related to cystic fibrosis, not asthma
  - localized findings on exam (e.g., localized wheeze) would suggest potential aspiration of a foreign body or congenital airway anomaly
- Objective measurements, if possible, to confirm diagnosis and assess severity:

  - spirometry at least annually on all children >6 years of age who are using asthma medication regularly to maintain asthma control;​[[1]](#c0039n00315) peak flow rates in children are an insensitive indicator of airflow limitation, and there may be significant airflow limitation in the presence of normal peak flows
  - impulse oscillometry in children 3–6 years of age, which could provide data suggesting reversible obstruction​[[4]](#impulseOscillometry)​[[5]](#XepapadakiPAdachiYPozoBelt)
  - skin testing to determine specific allergic sensitization to inhalants​[[14]](#c0039n00084)
  - blood eosinophils levels to help guide treatment decisions in those with difficult-to-control asthma if biologic therapies are being considered​[[1]](#c0039n00315)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Advise patients/caregivers to avoid patient exposure to cigarette smoke.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[15]](#c0039n00361)​[[16]](#c0039n00086)​[[17]](#c0039n00087)​[[18]](#c0039n00088)
- Advise sensitized patients to avoid known allergens.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[15]](#c0039n00361)​[[19]](#c0039n00089) Evaluate and individualize environmental control measures.
- Educate caregivers and children regarding chronicity of asthma and proper use of inhaler devices (see [Principles of Management](#c0039n00071) and [Drug Delivery Devices](#c0039n00237)).

### Pharmacologic Choices

See [Figure 1](#c0039n00059) for an asthma management algorithm and [Table 2](#c0039n00081) for detailed drug information.

### Principles of Management

Asthma symptoms are due to airway hyperreactivity and narrowing. Airway obstruction is due to a combination of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. SABAs provide short-term relief from bronchospasm and have no effect on airway inflammation. Furthermore, regular use of SABAs has been associated with decreased effect (tachyphylaxis) and rebound bronchoconstriction.​[[20]](#Hancox2000) As such, the GINA report has removed SABAs as the first step in asthma management for children >6 years of age and adults and encourages the earlier use of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). While this was not formally added to the guidelines for younger children (<6 y) at the time of publication, the Canadian guidelines also encourage the earlier use of an ICS in children <6 years of age.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[2]](#c0039n00297)

Regular use of an ICS to treat airway inflammation is required if the symptoms or measurements of airway dysfunction are perceived as persistent (see [Figure 1](#c0039n00059) for persistent symptoms).​[[21]](#KewKMQuinnMQuonBSEtAl.IncreasedVers-9D3F0848) Inhaled corticosteroids control airway obstruction within weeks of initiation. Regular use for months or years is required to control airway inflammation.​[[22]](#c0039n00108)​[[23]](#c0039n00109) The episodic use of ICS for a few weeks at a time may be sufficient to control symptoms in some milder cases, but has not been shown to be adequate for cases of more persistent asthma.​[[24]](#ChongJHaranCChauhanBFEtAl.Intermitt-9D3F66D0)

### Drug Delivery Devices

Inhalation is the preferred route of administration because the therapeutic effect is maximized and systemic side effects are minimized. The hydrofluoroalkane propellants (HFA) used in pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) demonstrate excellent lung deposition of active ingredients.​[[25]](#c0039n00091)

Review inhalation technique regularly (see [Therapeutic Tips](#c0039n00080)). For infants and young children (<5 y), a pMDI and spacer device (also called a holding chamber) with a mask or mouthpiece attachment improves ability to correctly use the device. Assess very young infants for their ability to produce sufficient respiratory effort to open and close the valves of a spacer device with mask. Drug deposition with a pMDI and spacer in infants and young children is generally 10–20% of the deposition in adults.​[[26]](#DiBlasiRM.ClinicalControversiesInAe-A05EF5B2) Therefore, higher doses may be required in younger children using a mask.​[[27]](#c0039n00093) In older children (≥5 y), either a dry powder device or a pMDI with a mouthpiece and spacer device may be used. Moving to a mouthpiece from a mask will improve drug delivery. Adherence may be enhanced if children participate in the selection of the device that works best for them. Incentive spirometers provide visual feedback to children about their inspiratory flows and can be an added teaching device. Online videos for teaching are available and important.

Wet nebulization is a less attractive alternative due to difficulties with portability, time required for therapy, aerosolization of any virus (e.g., COVID-19) and cost.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[28]](#c0039n00094) Treatment of asthma exacerbations with pMDI salbutamol with a spacer device is just as effective as treatment from nebulization.​[[29]](#CatesCJWelshEJRoweBH.HoldingChamber-9D405588) Furthermore, lung deposition of a drug is compromised if the technique is not meticulous, such as when the mask is not on the child’s face, if tubing is used rather than the mask or if a soother is in the infant’s mouth.

### Bronchodilator Agents

### Short-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

SABAs such as salbutamol and terbutaline effectively relieve smooth muscle spasm, but do not reduce airway reactivity or inflammation. Use of SABAs >2 times per week (including any doses used to prevent or treat exercise-induced symptoms) indicates suboptimal long-term control.​[[3]](#CTS_mild)​[[30]](#c0039n00316)

Urgently assess children who do not derive adequate relief from SABAs or those requiring SABAs for relief of shortness of breath at night; a course of systemic corticosteroids may be required, and the initiation of daily ICS is recommended.​[[1]](#c0039n00315) Consider alternate diagnoses in all children who do not benefit from the use of these agents, as SABAs are very effective at providing relief from wheeze or shortness of breath.

Administration of a SABA (e.g., 2 inhalations of 100 mcg/inhalation salbutamol) 5–10 minutes before exercise prevents exercise-induced bronchospasm for up to 2–4 hours.​[[31]](#c0039n00096)​[[32]](#BoniniMDiMambroCCalderonMAEtAl.Beta-9D40CC4B)

Administration of a SABA in times of distress may require more than 2 inhalations at one time to truly break the spasm of bronchoconstriction.​[[33]](#CloutierMMBaptistAPBlakeKVEtAl)

### Long-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) such as salmeterol and formoterol provide up to 12 hours of symptom control and protection from exercise-induced bronchospasm.​[[34]](#c0039n00097) The exact role of LABAs in children is evolving; however, they should always be used in combination with an ICS.​[[15]](#c0039n00361)​[[35]](#c0039n00311) In steroid-naïve individuals with asthma, initiating therapy with ICS is as effective as initiating therapy with a combination of ICS/LABA.​[[36]](#c0039n00327) However, in the setting of suboptimal asthma control, ICS/LABA combination therapy has been helpful in children 6–11 years of age on moderate doses of ICS and children >12 years of age on low doses of ICS.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)​[[15]](#c0039n00361) There is a suggestion of improvement in lung function measurements and improved linear growth with ICS/LABA compared with doubling the dose of ICS. However, studies in children have not demonstrated a reduction in asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids when comparing ICS with ICS/LABA.​[[37]](#c0039n00317) In children <6 years of age with asthma, the role of LABAs remains to be determined. Recent guideline updates recommend referral to a specialist before any consideration of LABA add-on therapy.​[[2]](#c0039n00297)

The budesonide/​formoterol combination, used as both maintenance and rescue therapy, was superior to either a fixed dose of budesonide/formoterol plus terbutaline rescue therapy or a high dose of budesonide plus terbutaline rescue therapy in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations, in the use of as-needed medication, and in symptoms such as nocturnal awakening.​[[38]](#c0039n00304)​[[39]](#c0039n00305) Currently, this combination is indicated for patients ≥12 years of age. At the time of publication, there have not yet been studies evaluating as-needed ICS/formoterol in children <12 years of age.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)

While the combination of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs can contribute to improved asthma control, it is important to remember there are a number of reasons for inadequate control of asthma (see [Difficult-to-Control Asthma](#c0039n00245)). Combination products should be used only after review and reinforcement of asthma control recommendations: 1) avoidance of triggers, 2) regular use of ICS and 3) good inhalation technique.

### Oral Beta2-agonists

Oral beta2-agonists for asthma management in children have been supplanted by the inhalation form, due to improved efficacy and reduction in systemic side effects.

### Anticholinergic Agents

This class of medication has seen an increased use in adults due to improved selectivity of these agents. Ipratropium **bromide** remains an adjunctive therapy in severe acute asthma exacerbations in children.​[[40]](#GriffithsBDucharmeFM.CombinedInhale-9D410F7E) Other newer anticholinergic medications (e.g., tiotropium) are now being studied in all ages groups; while it appears their safety is reasonable, their efficacy remains to be determined.​[[41]](#Vrijlandt-56FC09D8)​[[42]](#VogelbergCEngelMLakiIEtAl)​[[43]](#Murphy-56FC0D65)

Although not approved for use in children in Canada, the international GINA report recommends the use of tiotropium (mist inhaler) as add-on therapy in children >6 years of age with a history of exacerbations despite appropriate, medium-dose ICS/LABA therapy.​[[1]](#c0039n00315) Referral to a pediatric asthma specialist is recommended if add-on tiotropium is being considered.

### Anti-inflammatory Agents

### Inhaled Corticosteroids

Inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone and mometasone) are the cornerstone of asthma management in infants and children, both to reduce and control symptoms and to prevent airway remodelling.​[[14]](#c0039n00084) Regular use of ICS has been found to have the following effects:

- Reduction in asthma exacerbations and mortality
- Improvement in pulmonary function and control of symptoms
- Reduction in the need for rescue bronchodilator treatment
- Reduction in the need for oral corticosteroids to treat exacerbations

Inhaled corticosteroids do not cure asthma and do not prevent development of asthma in preschool children at high risk. Cessation following months of regular use may result in return of airway hyperreactivity to the previous state.​[[47]](#c0039n00106)

Symptom control generally occurs within days with low doses (see [Table 1](#table-ICSdosing));​[[49]](#c0039n00107) however, reduction in airway hyperreactivity may require months of regular use.​[[22]](#c0039n00108)​[[23]](#c0039n00109) The majority of children with asthma experience good control with low doses of ICS.​[[50]](#c0039n00110)​[[51]](#c0039n00111)​[[52]](#c0039n00112)​[[53]](#c0039n00113)​[[54]](#c0039n00369) Reconsider the diagnosis in children whose asthma is poorly controlled at higher doses, e.g., >800 mcg/day of budesonide or equivalent.

Doubling up or quintupling the dose of ICS in response to a viral respiratory tract infection or to control an exacerbation of asthma is common practice, but there are no data to support this. However, the early signs of an exacerbation are poorly defined and often underappreciated.​[[55]](#c0039n00312) Moreover, the dose response relationship of inhaled corticosteroids has not been consistent.​[[56]](#c0039n00370) As such, the episodic increasing of the ICS dose with exacerbations is not supported by evidence nor by Canadian guidelines.​[[15]](#c0039n00361)​[[21]](#KewKMQuinnMQuonBSEtAl.IncreasedVers-9D3F0848)​[[57]](#Jackson-56FCA333)​[[58]](#c0039n00115)​[[59]](#c0039n00122)​[[60]](#c0039n00313) Emphasize regular use of ICS in a dose sufficient to control airway hyperreactivity rather than episodic short-term doubling of ICS in response to asthma symptoms.​[[61]](#BeigelmanABacharierLB.ManagementOfP-9D47BB97)

Doses of budesonide ≤400 mcg/day or equivalent (see [Table 1](#table-ICSdosing)) have minimal systemic side effects. Most studies indicate there is an initial decrease in growth rate during the first year of ICS use, but that it has a minimal effect on final adult height (1–2.5 cm).​[[62]](#c0039n00117)​[[63]](#c0039n00274)​[[64]](#c0039n00275)​[[65]](#c0039n00276)​[[66]](#c0039n00363)​[[67]](#DeLeonibusCAttanasiMRozeZEtAl.Influ-9D426FC6) There is a lack of data regarding higher doses of ICS or the impact of ICS “holidays,” e.g., discontinuation during the summer months. Always titrate to the lowest effective dose that maintains asthma control.

### Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) (e.g., montelukast) may provide bronchoprotection with exercise and in patients with ASA-sensitive asthma;​[[14]](#c0039n00084)​[[22]](#c0039n00108) however, these patients should still avoid the use of NSAIDs when on LTRAs. Past reports suggested that montelukast may have corticosteroid-sparing properties,​[[68]](#c0039n00277)​[[69]](#c0039n00278)​[[70]](#c0039n00279) resulting in improved asthma control and reduced exacerbations in preschool children,​[[71]](#c0039n00281)​[[72]](#c0039n00282) and might reduce asthma exacerbations in September in school-aged children and adolescents.​[[73]](#c0039n00307) A 2015 Cochrane review has questioned the strength of these data.​[[74]](#BrodlieMGuptaARodriguez-MartinezCEE-9D433785) LTRAs are not recommended as first-choice monotherapy in place of ICS, due to inferior efficacy in preventing acute exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids and in improving other parameters of lung function.​[[75]](#c0039n00364)

LTRAs can be used as adjunctive therapy with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids to achieve control of persistent asthma or in patients who cannot or will not use inhaled corticosteroids. It appears that the addition of LTRA is inferior to the addition of LABA for achieving asthma control.​[[76]](#ChauhanBFDucharmeFM.AdditionToInhal-9D436F14)

Due to reports of behavioural and mood-related changes, a boxed warning has been issued for montelukast; if such changes are observed in patients taking montelukast, the drug should be stopped and symptoms should be discussed immediately with a health-care professional.​[[77]](#MontelukastBoxedWarning)

Reports of development of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome), an eosinophilic vasculitis, with the use of LTRAs likely represents an unmasking of the vasculitis as doses of systemic corticosteroids are reduced.​[[78]](#c0039n00283)​[[79]](#c0039n00284)​[[80]](#c0039n00285)

### Biologic Therapies

Targeted biologic therapies are being used in children. Their use is reserved for children diagnosed with asthma by a subspecialist where the asthma is not controlled by the therapies discussed above. Unfortunately, in many cases, high cost is also an important factor when considering biologics. The following therapies should be initiated and monitored by a specialist.

- IgE-neutralizing antibodies: omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds IgE receptors, thus impeding the IgE-mediated allergic response. It has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations and allow a reduction in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids with improved asthma symptom control.​[[81]](#c0039n00287)​[[82]](#c0039n00376) It is indicated for children ≥6 years of age with moderate to severe asthma inadequately controlled with ICS with evidence of allergic IgE-mediated asthma.
- IL4R neutralizing antibody (anti-IL4R): interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are cytokines involved in multiple pathways of allergic inflammation. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4Rα) of IL-4 and IL-13 and inhibits activity. It is indicated as add-on therapy in patients ≥6 years of age with severe asthma or atopic dermatitis.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)
- Thymic stromal lymphopoietin antibodies (anti-TSLP): TSLP is a cytokine that has been found to play a role in the generation and maintenance of allergic inflammation. Anti-TSLP is indicated for people ≥12 years of age to prevent severe asthma exacerbations.​[[1]](#c0039n00315)
- IL-5-neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL5): The cytokine IL5 plays a key role in the generation and survival of eosinophils in allergic disease. Mepolizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody that prevents IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils, thus reducing blood eosinophils to normal levels. It is indicated as add-on maintenance treatment for adolescents and children ≥6 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma who are inadequately controlled with medium-to-high-dose ICS and additional asthma controller(s) (e.g., LABA) *and* who have had a blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/µL (0.3 GI/L) in the past 12 months.
- At the time of writing, other anti-IL5 therapies (e.g., benralizumab) were not approved for use in children in Canada.

### Methylxanthines

Theophylline preparations used as add-on therapy historically had an additional anti-inflammatory role in patients already using ICS therapy.​[[44]](#c0039n00103)​[[45]](#c0039n00104) Theophylline is rarely used for asthma therapy in children because of the potential for toxicity, numerous drug interactions and the need for monitoring of serum levels. There is no evidence that IV aminophylline is superior in an ICU setting compared to continuous beta2-agonist IV.​[[46]](#OkpapiAFriendAJTurnerSW.AsthmaAndOt-9D416C8C) Oxtriphylline is no longer available as a single-ingredient product in Canada.

### Difficult-to-Control Asthma

The majority of children with asthma can be well controlled with regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and SABAs for occasional relief.​[[30]](#c0039n00316)​[[83]](#c0039n00326) If there is ongoing difficulty with asthma control, as evidenced by persistent symptoms, a need for systemic corticosteroids or exacerbations of asthma necessitating an emergency department visit, consider several factors before concluding the child has difficult-to-control asthma:

- Ensure correct inhaler technique, including the use of a mouthpiece instead of a mask when possible; **it is important to have children/caregivers demonstrate their understanding of their devices**
- Ensure adherence to medical therapy​[[84]](#c0039n00314)​[[85]](#c0039n00328)
- Ensure adequate irritant and allergen avoidance strategies and rule out comorbidities,​[[86]](#SheehanWJPhipatanakulW.Difficult-to-9D43DA89)

  which can produce persistent cough:​[[9]](#DecalmerSStovoldRHoughtonLAEtAl.Chr-9D3D25D6)
  - vocal cord irritation from rhinitis​[[87]](#TharpeCAKempSF.PediatricAllergicRhi-9D446520)
  - gastroesophageal reflux​[[88]](#LangJEHossainJHolbrookJTEtAl.Gastro-9D449913)
  - eosinophilic esophagitis​[[89]](#KruppNLSehraSSlavenJEEtAl.Increased-9D44BE6A)
- Reconsider the diagnosis of asthma, for example:

  - intercurrent infection, e.g., pertussis
  - cystic fibrosis, immune system disorders, primary ciliary dyskinesia
  - anatomic airway malformations
  - vocal cord dysfunction (VCD; involuntary laryngeal obstruction)

Note: The use of systemic corticosteroids may have long-term consequences on adrenal function and on bone health. The use of 4 short courses of systemic corticosteroids over a period of 2.5 years has been associated with an increased risk of fractures.​[[90]](#c0039n00373)

### Asthma Exacerbation Management

An exacerbation of asthma requiring an unscheduled doctor’s visit, emergency room visit or hospitalization is a failure of long-term preventative management. Immediate care for respiratory distress, evaluation of the cause of the exacerbation and intensification of long-term preventative care are indicated.

An asthma exacerbation is a pediatric emergency. In the emergency department setting, [pediatric respiratory assessment measure (PRAM) scores](https://www.chusj.org/CORPO/files/32/32ba0b8c-4894-4d8e-87ca-a46e4c0924a5.pdf) are used to help guide therapy and improve outcomes.​[[91]](#TrottierEDChanKAllainDEtAl)​[[92]](#PRAMscore)​[[93]](#DucharmeFMChalutDPlotnickLEtAl) Initial therapy should be aggressive and then reduced as the exacerbation settles. See [Figure 2](#c0039n00060) for an approach to asthma exacerbation management. Severe exacerbations are more likely in patients with oxygen saturation <95%, presence of suprasternal retraction, presence of scalene muscle contraction, reduced air entry, wheezing (inspiratory/stridor, expiratory or audible without stethoscope) or silent chest.

Initial steps should include assessment of airway with continuous monitoring until the patient is stable. Oxygen should be administered if the patient is found to be hypoxic.

The cornerstones of therapy are supplemental oxygen, frequent high-dose inhaled SABAs and systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone).​[[94]](#NormansellRKewKMMansourG.DifferentO-9D45526E) Measure blood gases to guide therapy as necessary. Be prepared for intubation, but avoid this and sedation, if possible. Noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) or high-flow therapy is preferred under close supervision. High-flow oxygen therapy has become an important means to stabilize children while the obstruction resolves.​[[95]](#highFlow02) Close observation and frequent reassessment of all children with acute severe asthma is mandatory. IV magnesium sulfate​[[100]](#GriffithsBKewKM.IntravenousMagnesiu-9D459709) or salbutamol are adjunctive therapies for more severe attacks. IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to improve pulmonary function in children.​[[96]](#SuZLiRGaiZ.Intravenous) Ipratropium may provide some additional bronchodilation and decrease hospitalization, but there are no trials to support its use beyond initial treatment (3 doses) in children (including in those hospitalized or discharged).​[[97]](#c0039n00288)​[[98]](#c0039n00289)​[[99]](#c0039n00375)​[[101]](#c0039n00290)​[[102]](#c0039n00378) There is little evidence that aminophylline is required in the management of acute severe asthma.​[[103]](#c0039n00293)​[[104]](#c0039n00294)

Asthma education, including an asthma action plan, should be performed in the urgent care setting before discharge, and patients should be prescribed an ICS in addition to a SABA.​[[2]](#c0039n00297) Arrange follow-up care for all children discharged home from the emergency department. For children with known asthma, it is important to review their asthma management to see if adjustments or optimization are required. This includes reviewing device technique and medication adherence.

### Therapeutic Tips

- An important message to convey to caregivers is that prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids (for a minimum of months or seasons) is often required to control airway dysfunction in children.
- Frequent re-evaluation of asthma control is essential. These visits provide a good opportunity to determine if the ICS dose can be reduced to achieve the lowest daily dose that provides excellent asthma control and prevents exacerbations.
- Both pMDIs and DPIs are as effective as nebulizers in an asthma exacerbation.
- Emphasis on good technique is crucial for the first 3–6 breaths with a spacer device/holding chamber. Little additional benefit is provided by subsequent breaths from these devices. With one commonly used spacer, 2 tidal breaths delivered 40% of the dose and 9 tidal breaths delivered 41% of the dose.​[[105]](#c0039n00329) See [Drug Delivery Devices](#c0039n00237).
- Moving to a mouthpiece from a mask as soon as possible (i.e., 4–5 y of age) will increase the amount of medication delivered to the lung where it is needed.
- Review inhaler technique regularly to ensure correct drug deposition. It is not uncommon for even an adolescent to forget to hold their breath after inhalation and allow adequate drug deposition. Caregivers need to spend time watching their children/adolescents take their medications properly. Improper technique is a leading cause of medication failure.
- Provide written instructions for the family that describe signs of worsening asthma (cough, wheeze or shortness of breath that interferes with sleep or activities), how to use a SABA for relief and actions to take when signs of worsening asthma are detected. An [asthma action plan](https://www.lung.ca/sites/default/files/media/asthma_action_plan.pdf) such as the one developed by the Canadian Lung Association may be useful.
- Allergy assessment is recommended for children with persistent asthma symptoms to determine whether environmental aeroallergens (e.g., pet danders) are contributing to the ongoing difficulties with asthma control and to advise on the importance of specific alterations in the home environment to reduce ongoing exposure.
- Note that the NACI recommendation​[[106]](#NACI) for annual influenza vaccine for all children with asthma is as yet unproven for the prevention of asthma exacerbation. Likely there are cohorts of asthma patients who would benefit, but this has not been determined.​[[107]](#CatesCJRoweBH.VaccinesForPreventing-9D3EAA5A)
- If there is little improvement with beta2-agonists or systemic corticosteroids, the diagnosis of asthma is in doubt; reassess patient to establish the appropriate diagnosis or identify concomitant conditions, e.g., gastroesophageal reflux/aspiration, postnasal drip/sinusitis or vocal cord dysfunction.
