### Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic narrowing of lower limb blood vessels that in some patients may cause claudication (limping or lameness). Symptoms include discomfort or cramping pain in leg muscles and fatigue that is consistently induced by exercise and consistently relieved by rest within 10 minutes.​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED)​[[2]](#NordanstigJBehrendtCABaumgartnerIEt-CE53C2ED)​[[3]](#c0033n00057) Intermittent claudication (IC) can present with these classic symptoms or with acute or critical limb ischemia. Individuals who smoke or have other cardiovascular risk factors are at increased risk for PAD. Also at risk are those with a history of short sleep duration and daytime napping.​[[4]](#FrankUNikolSBelchJEtAl.ESVMGuidelin-21F61CE7)

### Goals of Therapy

- Improve mobility and quality of life
- Increase walking distance and time to claudication
- Increase capacity for regular dynamic leg exercise
- Prevent associated cardiovascular events
- Reduce functional decline, severe ischemic limb events and need for operative interventions

### Investigations

- History with special attention to cardiovascular disease risk factors and associated conditions: angina pectoris/MI, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, TIA/stroke
- Define walking time to claudication (severe = <one-half city block; moderate = one-half to 1 block; mild = >1 block). One city block is approximately 100 m (300 ft)
- Define duration of symptoms (a period of 6–12 months is required to develop collateral circulation)
- Physical examination:

  - signs of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis (aortic aneurysm, bruits), heart failure
  - signs of peripheral artery obstruction as indicated by diminished pulses in the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and/or dorsalis pedis arteries; conversely, the absence of a decreased pulse or bruit indicates lower likelihood of obstruction
  - evidence of acute peripheral artery occlusion (acute onset of continuous pain; pale and cool limb or mottled discoloration; thickened, swollen, stiff muscles plus pain over the muscle)
  - resting pain, dependent rubor, cyanosis, muscle atrophy and/or trophic ulcers suggest severe obstruction
- Laboratory tests:

  - fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine and lipid profile
  - hemoglobin (anemia may exacerbate symptoms), hematocrit and platelet count
  - increased levels of D dimer and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, amyloid A) are associated with higher short-term (within 1–2 years) risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality​[[7]](#c0033n00075)
  - resting Doppler-derived or sphygmomanometric ankle/arm systolic pressure index (ankle-brachial index is the highest systolic pressure measured at the ankle divided by the highest measured arm [brachial] pressure)​[[8]](#c0033n00076) (see [Figure 1](#c0033n00005))
  - consider invasive angiography for patients with signs of severe limb ischemia (resting pain, muscle atrophy, cyanosis, nonhealing ischemic ulcers or gangrene) in preparation for possible angioplastic or surgical revascularization

  The role of platelet-derived MRP-14 as a marker for the progression of PAD is under investigation.​[[2]](#NordanstigJBehrendtCABaumgartnerIEt-CE53C2ED)​[[9]](#Treat-JacobsonDMcDermottMMBeckmanJA-21F85EBC)

### Therapeutic Choices

The treatment of intermittent claudication is summarized in [Figure 1](#c0033n00005).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Discontinuation of smoking (active and passive) (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation)
- Time (collateral flow develops over 6–12 months)
- Nondrug treatment of diabetes (see Diabetes Mellitus), hypertension (see Hypertension) lipid disorders (see Dyslipidemias), obesity (see Obesity) and associated conditions

### Exercise

Regular dynamic leg exercise such as walking (3 times/wk for at least 30 min for 12 wk initially).​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED) Dynamic leg exercise for 6–12 months after the onset of claudication allows collateral circulation to develop; continued exercise 3 or more times a week over 24–36 months slows functional decline.

Ideally supervised exercise therapy (SET) for 3 months should be followed by transition to a home or community program.​[[10]](#FazinFSpronkSVanDerLindenLEtAl.Endo-F33D4D27) Patients of all genders respond favourably to exercise therapy for intermittent claudication (IC) due to PAD.​[[11]](#WeaverMLBoitanoLTFazzoneBJEtAl.SexD-CE53D0C0) Techniques to promote and motivate exercise using smartphones and other tracking technology are under development.​[[12]](#AbaraoguUOSeenanCDallPEtAl.Systemat-CE53D36E)​[[13]](#WikkelingORM.ANovelWayToEnhanceComp-CE53D6F7)

The utility of high-intensity exercise or concomitant extracorporeal shock wave therapy or neuromuscular stimulation has not been established.​[[14]](#McDermottMMSpringBTianLEtAl.EffectO-CE53D9C9)​[[15]](#PymerSHarwoodAEIbeggazeneSEtAl.High-CE53DCAF)​[[16]](#MunirZAkashMJaipradaFEtAl.Evaluatio-CE53DF87)​[[17]](#BurgessLSmithSBabberAEtAl.Neuromusc-CE53E2B7)

### Revascularization Interventions

Early revascularization procedures do not alter long-term limb outcomes from PAD.​[[18]](#HussainMAAl-OmranMMamdaniMEtAl.Effi-CE53E87E)​[[19]](#KulloIJRookeTW.ClinicalPractice.Per-CE53EBA9)​[[20]](#GunnarssonTBergmanSPxe4rssonHEtAl.L-CE53EF31)​[[21]](#DakhelAZarroukMEkelundJEtAl.WorseCa-CE53F1A6)​[[22]](#HafeezMSKhamzinaYAndraskaEEtAl.Opti-CE53F42C) The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and European guidelines provide an overview on methods for revascularization and postintervention drug therapy plus maintenance of exercise targets.​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED)​[[2]](#NordanstigJBehrendtCABaumgartnerIEt-CE53C2ED)​[[23]](#ShishehborMHPowellRJMontero-BakerMF-CE53E563)

Endovascular procedures followed by supervised exercise improved walking times more than supervised exercise alone in the ERASE study;​[[10]](#FazinFSpronkSVanDerLindenLEtAl.Endo-F33D4D27) however, over a 12-month follow-up period, this benefit decreased.

The IRONIC trial randomized 158 patients with mild-to-severe intermittent claudication to either revascularization plus best medical therapy and structured exercise therapy (the revascularization group) or best medical therapy plus structured exercise therapy (the nonrevascularization group). At 5 years of follow-up, the revascularization strategy had lost its early benefit and did not result in any long-term improvement in health-related quality of life or walking capacity compared to a noninvasive treatment strategy.​[[24]](#DjerfHMillingerJFalkenbergMEtAl.Abs-21F9256B)

Almost one-half of revascularization procedures reported in a U.S. case series were in patients with failed prior endovascular procedures.​[[25]](#JonesDWSchanzerAZhaoYEtAlVascularSt-F33D5014) These patients had higher rates of graft failure, morbidity and mortality than after the initial intervention.

Compared to patients without diabetes mellitus, patients with diabetes had higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) during 5 years of follow-up after infrainguinal endovascular surgery for IC. Furthermore, HbA1c is associated with total mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus.​[[21]](#DakhelAZarroukMEkelundJEtAl.WorseCa-CE53F1A6)

For patients with severe ischemia, bypass surgery or angioplasty have similar effects on amputation-free survival and all-cause mortality over a 6-month period, although morbidity and costs are higher for patients receiving surgery first rather than angioplasty.​[[26]](#c0033n00056)​[[27]](#c0033n00079) Amputation-free survival is higher and all-cause mortality is lower 2 and 3 years after surgery, compared with angioplasty according to a post-hoc analysis of a large randomized trial.​[[26]](#c0033n00056)

Paresthesia and paralysis require immediate surgical revascularization (fibrinolysis may be considered where symptoms are present for <14 days).

### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic options for improving mobility, walking distance and time to claudication are limited. Drug therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events is recommended (see [Table 1](#c0033n00008)).

### Cardiovascular Risk Reduction

Intermittent claudication occurs as a symptom of atherosclerotic occlusion in PAD. The therapeutic goal is to reduce MALE (evolution to limb-threatening ischemia or limb loss) as well as MACE (MI, stroke, cardiovascular death) through optimized treatment of the following conditions.

### Diabetes mellitus

SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) should be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and PAD, since they have been shown to reduce MACE and MALE.​[[28]](#BonacaMPWiviottSDZelnikerTAEtAl.Dap-CE53FF1D)​[[29]](#WiviottSDRazIBonacaMPEtAl.Dapaglifl-CE5401C0)​[[30]](#DicembriniITomberliBNreuBEtAl.Perip-CE6C3127) The possible association of canagliflozin with increased lower limb amputation has not been verified.​[[31]](#HuangCYLeeJK.Sodium-glucoseCo-trans-CE540437) The evidence for use of GLP–1 receptor agonists (exenatide, lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide and semaglutide) is less robust.​[[32]](#LiarakosALTentolourisAKokkinosAEtAl-CE5406EA) See also Diabetes Mellitus - Chronic Complications.

### Dyslipidemia

**HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors** (statins) reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis and may improve symptoms and increase walking distance in patients with IC.​​​[[33]](#PearsonGJThanassoulisGAndersonTJEtA-CE5409E0)

Therapy required to achieve target levels suggested by guidelines often involve a balance of cost and adverse effects for maximal doses of statins plus additional drugs such as ezetimibe, PCSK-9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) or icosapent ethyl (see Dyslipidemias).​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED)​[[34]](#BonacaMPNaultPGiuglianoRPEtAl.Low-d-CE540D80)​[[35]](#ClavijoLCCaroJChoiJEtAl.TheAddition-CE54103A)

### Anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents

The COMPASS trial and others have prompted the development of several recommendations. The COMPASS trial evaluated the anticoagulant rivaroxaban or ASA alone or in combination in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with CAD and PAD. Combination therapy gave increased survival benefit for all patients including those with PAD. These patients also had reduced MALE but more major bleeding events.​[[36]](#AnandSSCaronFEikelboomJWEtAl.MajorA-21FA91C0)​[[37]](#c0033n00058)

Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA (80–100 mg daily) is recommended for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD who are at high risk for ischemic events (high-risk comorbidities such as polyvascular disease, diabetes, history of heart failure, or renal insufficiency and/or high-risk limb presentation post peripheral revascularization, limb amputation, rest pain, ischemic ulcers) and at low risk for bleeding.​[[38]](#BonacaMPBauersachsRMAnandSSEtAl.Riv-7C9300D7)

Single antiplatelet therapy with either ASA (75–325 mg) or clopidogrel (75 mg) can be considered for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD at high bleeding risk who remain eligible for antithrombotic therapy. Ticagrelor has been shown to be similar to clopidogrel in symptomatic peripheral artery disease.​​[[39]](#SchuylerJonesWBaumgartnerIHiattWREt-EE849A3E)

Routine antithrombotic therapy for patients with *isolated asymptomatic* lower extremity PAD is not recommended. Low molecular weight heparin has not been effective treatment for chronic PAD.

Suggested therapy following elective lower extremity revascularization can be found in the CCS guidelines​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED) and Thrombosis Canada - Clinical Guides.​[[40]](#ThrombosisCanadax2013ClinicalGuides-CE54198E)

### Hypertension

The ACE inhibitor ramipril reduced the risk of ischemic events beyond that expected from lowering BP in patients with PAD in the HOPE study.​[[41]](#c0033n00012) Ramipril increased walking time and distance in patients with PAD in a small randomized study.​[[42]](#c0033n00059)

In a trial of 5713 participants with intermediate or high risk for MACE were randomized to a polypill (containing 40 mg of simvastatin, 100 mg of atenolol, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 10 mg of **ramipril**) or placebo daily, **ASA** (75 mg) or placebo daily, and vitamin D or placebo daily for a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Combined treatment with a polypill plus ASA led to a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than did placebo.​[[43]](#YusufSJosephPDansAEtAl.PolypillWith-CE5421D0)

In 503 patients with PAD, a subset of 9361 participants from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), intensive BP lowering to a systolic BP target <120 mm Hg was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome of CV death and all-cause mortality. Because of the higher baseline risk among patients with PAD, the absolute risk reduction was larger in patients with PAD compared with those without PAD. However, intensive BP control also led to a greater absolute increased risk of adverse events in patients with PAD.​[[44]](#FraryJMCPareekMByrneCEtAl.Intensive-CE54245D) Canadian guidelines suggest treating to a target of <140/90 mmHg, but in select patients, intensive targets might be considered.​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED)

ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are independently associated with improved survival and amputation-free survival in patients undergoing peripheral vascular intervention for critical limb ischemia.​[[45]](#ArmstrongEJChenDCSinghGDEtAl.Angiot-CE54261D)

Treatment guidelines (see Hypertension) recommend initiating therapy for BP >140/90 mm (>135/85 in diabetes) using an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with the addition of other classes such as a calcium channel blocker and/or a diuretic as required. The incidence of adverse hemodynamic effects increases with BP <120 mmHg.

Beta-blockers reduce the risk of MI and death in patients with atherosclerosis, but use of these agents in patients with PAD was previously discouraged because they were thought to worsen symptoms. Beta-blockers do not affect walking capacity in patients with PAD;​[[46]](#c0033n00013) thus, it is reasonable to use them to treat hypertension in this population,​[[47]](#c0033n00014) although they should be used cautiously in those with severe PAD (ankle-brachial index <0.4 or resting pain and patients considered to be candidates for surgical or angioplastic intervention).​[[47]](#c0033n00014) Beta-blockers are not recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients over 60 years of age unless there are other compelling indications such as angina, recent MI or a supraventricular arrhythmia.

### Specific Therapy for Intermittent Claudication

Specific agents suggested in guidelines may increase walking distance in IC, but none have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events or mortality. Trial data are limited.

Pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine derivative, alters erythrocyte deformability and reduces blood viscosity, platelet reactivity and plasma hypercoagulability. Individual studies of pentoxifylline find marginal and variable improvement, but heterogeneity in study design prevents pooling of the data in a meta-analysis.​[[48]](#c0033n00017) Pentoxifylline is no longer recommended in treatment guidelines.​[[1]](#AbramsonBLAl-OmranMAnandSSEtAl.Cana-CE53BFED)​[[2]](#NordanstigJBehrendtCABaumgartnerIEt-CE53C2ED)​[[3]](#c0033n00057)

Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation by selectively inhibiting phosphodiesterase III and is a vasodilator that improved maximal treadmill walking distance in small studies.​[[49]](#c0033n00019)​[[50]](#c0033n00080) It is recommended in European and American guidelines but is not available in Canada.

Naftidrofuryl is a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 receptor antagonist that is thought to promote glucose uptake and increase ATP levels. A Cochrane analysis suggests cilostazol may be better than naftidrofuryl;​[[51]](#BedenisRStewartMCleanthisMEtAl.Cilo-21FB3E25) however, an earlier study concluded naftidrofuryl was better than cilostazol with pentoxifylline being the least effective.​[[52]](#StevensJWSimpsonEHarnanSEtAl.System-21FB7779) Naftidrofuryl is not available in Canada.

### Other Therapies

The role of vasoactive agents, buflomedil,​[[53]](#c0033n00062) prostaglandin analogues,​[[54]](#c0033n00063)​[[55]](#c0033n00085) L-arginine, L-carnitine or arterial gene therapy​[[56]](#c0033n00021) has not been defined by adequate clinical trials. Ginkgo biloba, vitamin E and chelation therapy are not effective for PAD.​[[57]](#Villarruz-SulitMVForsterRDansALEtAl-E06ABFDB)​[[58]](#NicolaiSPKruidenierLMBendermacher-E06AC575)​[[59]](#KleijnenJMackerrasD.VitaminEForInte-E06AD376)
