### Introduction

Rome IV criteria define diarrhea as loose or watery stools, without predominant abdominal pain or bothersome bloating, occurring in >25% of stools.​[[1]](#refitem-1162111-D76402AC) Clinically, stool consistency between types 5–7 on the Bristol stool form scale may be used to guide diagnosis (see Constipation in Adults for Bristol scale).​[[2]](#Arasaradnam2018BSG) Increased loss of fecal water and electrolytes occurs with the increased excretion of fecal matter. Patients who have other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as fecal incontinence or fecal urgency, or who notice a change in stool consistency, may refer to it as diarrhea. These symptoms will need to be ruled out before a true diagnosis of diarrhea is given.

Diarrhea may be defined as acute (<14 days in duration), persistent (14–30 days in duration) or chronic (>30 days in duration).​[[3]](#2016ACGGuidelineAcuteDiarrhea) While acute diarrhea is often caused by infection (see [Table 1](#n00279)), the causes of chronic diarrhea are not always clear. As diagnostic tests are often not readily available, a specific diagnosis may not be possible. Patients who present with chronic diarrhea pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians.​[[5]](#refitem-114212-D6E6F263) During the initial evaluation of these patients, it may be useful to categorize the various etiologies of chronic diarrhea by typical stool characteristics (see [Table 2](#n00282)).

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce symptoms and improve stool frequency or consistency to improve quality of life
- Prevent and treat complications, e.g., dehydration, electrolyte depletion, nutrient malabsorption, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse
- Remove or eradicate the cause of diarrhea where possible

### Investigations

Key questions prior to treatment:​[[3]](#2016ACGGuidelineAcuteDiarrhea)​[[6]](#c0113n00030)​[[7]](#c0113n00031)

- What is the patientʼs history? Obtain a thorough history that includes the following clinical and epidemiologic features:

  - when and how the illness began (duration of symptoms; abrupt or gradual onset)
  - if the stools are difficult to flush; if they have a particularly foul smell or contain oil droplets (suggestive of steatorrhea)
  - sexual activity (diarrhea is common in patients with HIV/AIDS)
  - family history (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, celiac disease)
  - stool characteristics (watery, bloody, mucousy, greasy)
  - frequency of bowel movements and quantity of stool produced
  - symptoms of volume depletion (thirst, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, decreased urination, lethargy, decreased skin turgor)
  - associated systemic symptoms and their frequency and intensity (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramps, headache, fever, myalgias, altered sensorium)
  - changes in diet
  - medication history, including use of prescription and nonprescription drugs, herbal or “natural” products and dietary supplements
  - recent travel history (see Travellers' Diarrhea)
  - locale of employment and residence and other co-workers or family members who have a similar illness
- Is this true diarrhea? Many people who complain of diarrhea actually have a motility disturbance, e.g., irritable bowel syndrome. They experience an increased frequency of small bowel movements, but the 24-hour stool weight does not exceed normal amounts. Most clinicians define diarrhea as a change in stool frequency or consistency that has a meaningful effect on quality of life.
- Is the diarrhea acute or chronic? In the absence of fever, dehydration or bloody stools, the management of acute diarrhea should alleviate symptoms rather than provide a specific diagnosis or therapy. Acute diarrhea (see [Figure 1](#c0113n00023), [Table 1](#n00279)) is frequently caused by viral agents, drugs or food toxins for which there is no specific therapy and usually remits spontaneously within 1 week. Acute infectious diarrhea of a bacterial or parasitic etiology should be identified early to permit early successful intervention. Evaluate chronic diarrhea as in [Figure 2](#c0113n00024).

### Acute Diarrhea

### Etiology

Identifying the etiology of acute diarrhea as presented in [Table 1](#n00279) is critical to therapy.

### Infectious Diarrhea

- The initial evaluation of infectious diarrhea begins with stool culture for common enteric pathogens and toxin assay for Clostridioides difficile. An ova and parasite (O&P) exam can be considered if there is a history of immunosuppression or travel to a region with increased risk of parasitic infections, e.g., emerging nations.
- Most often, diarrhea caused by an infectious agent is self-limiting and treatment is largely supportive.
- Selective fecal testing can improve the yield and usefulness of stool testing:

  - consider Escherichia coli 0157 in persons with a history of undercooked red meat ingestion and acute bloody diarrhea or hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as in those with marked abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea but without high fever
  - consider Vibrio parahaemolyticus in persons who have ingested shellfish within the 3 days before the illness began
  - consider C. difficile toxin assay in all patients with diarrhea
  - test immunocompromised patients or those with significant comorbidities that increase the risk of complications
  - test patients with inflammatory bowel disease in whom distinction between a flare and superimposed infection is critical, e.g., to rule out cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis
  - note that fecal specimens from patients with diarrhea that develops after 3 days of hospitalization have a low yield when cultured for standard bacterial pathogens (e.g., Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella) or examined for ova and parasites

### Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea

- Antibiotic-associated diarrhea usually occurs during or shortly after the administration of an antibiotic. The use of any antibiotic can alter the commensal gastrointestinal microflora and lead to diarrhea in approximately 5–35% of patients.​[[8]](#c0113n00210) Most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are mild and resolve spontaneously. The pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea can vary and includes accelerated gastrointestinal motility (e.g., erythromycin), osmotic diarrhea due to decreased carbohydrate metabolism by colonic anaerobes or opportunistic infections, alterations in intestinal absorption and/or secretion, bacterial overgrowth syndromes, and C. difficile infection (CDI).
- C. difficile is the most common bacterium responsible for antibiotic-associated infectious diarrhea.​[[9]](#Nasiri2018)
- The spectrum of symptoms associated with CDI range from no symptoms (carrier state) through to watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and distention, toxic megacolon, and death (5% mortality).​[[10]](#c0113n00230)
- Diagnosis consists of detection of C. difficile toxin in the stool or presence of characteristic pseudomembranous colitis on endoscopy. Stool culture is the most sensitive test but it is expensive and has a slow turnaround time, so it is rarely used in clinical practice. Enzyme-immunoassay testing for C. difficile toxins A and B is rapid but less sensitive. Molecular testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting the toxin B gene has been developed and is highly sensitive; however, it is also expensive. There is limited value in repeat testing during the same episode of diarrhea.​[[10]](#c0113n00230)

### Chronic Diarrhea

[Figure 2](#c0113n00024) illustrates the evaluation of chronic diarrhea; [Table 2](#n00282) outlines the conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are 2 conditions commonly associated with chronic diarrhea. The Rome IV diagnostic criteria for IBS are recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week in the past 3 months associated with 2 or more of the following: a change in frequency of stool, a change in appearance of stool or pain related to defecation. Symptom onset should be at least 6 months before diagnosis and symptoms should be present during the past 3 months.​[[1]](#refitem-1162111-D76402AC) See Irritable Bowel Syndrome. IBD is an idiopathic condition characterized by chronic or relapsing immune activation and inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. The 2 major forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). UC is restricted to the colon while CD may involve any part of the GI tract. See Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Discontinue medications that cause diarrhea when feasible, e.g., acarbose, antacids containing magnesium, antibiotics, cholinergic drugs, fluorouracil, irinotecan, laxatives, metformin, promotility agents, prostaglandins, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib).​[[6]](#c0113n00030)
- Stop ingestion of poorly absorbed carbohydrates, e.g., dietetic candies and jams containing sorbitol, mannitol or xylitol; beverages and foods containing fructose; or lactose-containing dairy products. If the history is compatible with lactose intolerance, a 2-week trial of a lactose-restricted diet can avoid costly diagnostic workups.​[[6]](#c0113n00030)
- Maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte intake; a bland diet (low fat, low carbohydrate including, for example, bananas, rice, unsweetened applesauce, clear soup) can be reintroduced once bowel movements have subsided.​[[6]](#c0113n00030) The use of oral rehydration therapy is especially important in children and infants when dehydration is present (see [Infectious Diarrhea](#c0113n00202)).
- Prevent C. difficile spread via direct contact. Prevention of spread consists of educating patients and health-care practitioners, practising good hand hygiene (frequent handwashing), isolating patients in hospital settings (until symptom-free for 48 h post initiation of treatment), wearing protective clothing (gowns and gloves), and enforcing environmental controls, e.g., cleaning of medical equipment.​[[11]](#c0113n00147)
- In the case of Norwalk virus, identify the causative agent to allow for institution of appropriate control measures, similar to C. difficile.

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 4](#c0113n00029) lists the agents used in the management of diarrhea.

### Acute Diarrhea

### Infectious Diarrhea

Use **oral rehydration therapy** **(ORT)** to prevent dehydration and electrolyte loss in both acute and chronic diarrhea (see Dehydration in Children). Oral rehydration solutions should have a balanced sodium-to-glucose ratio. Excess glucose (e.g., Jell-O or soft drinks) or excess sodium (e.g., Gatorade or other sports drinks) may aggravate diarrhea as a consequence of their osmotic effect. Early use of ORT is essential for young children and the elderly.

Balanced electrolyte oral rehydration solutions are available commercially without prescription, e.g., Gastrolyte, Pedialyte. If necessary, a similar solution can be made by adding one-half teaspoonful (2.5 mL) of salt and 6 teaspoonfuls (30 mL) of sugar to 4 cups (1 L) of water.​[[13]](#c0113n00034)​[[14]](#refitem-114219-999268D8)

Aside from travellers’ diarrhea (see Travellers' Diarrhea), empiric **antibiotic** treatment is not generally recommended for acute diarrhea because of the self-limiting nature of most illnesses, the cost of treatment, the potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance and the possibility of adverse drug reactions.​[[13]](#c0113n00034)​[[15]](#c0113n00138)

Bismuth subsalicylate has been shown to be effective in small cohort studies in the treatment of acute diarrhea and diarrhea caused by microscopic colitis (see [Table 4](#c0113n00029)).​[[3]](#2016ACGGuidelineAcuteDiarrhea)​[[16]](#Senderovich2021) Although frequently used in acute diarrheas, there is no clear evidence for its efficacy. The salicylate component can cause gastric and duodenal mucosal damage, particularly in patients who are also taking ASA or NSAIDs. At high doses, the calcium carbonate in the tablet formulation can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and associated metabolic symptoms. Bismuth-related encephalopathy can result from the use of doses 10 times those recommended or after years of use. Black stools due to bismuth may be confused with melena.

Opioids (codeine, diphenoxylate, loperamide) are effective antimotility agents for symptomatic use in both acute and chronic diarrhea (see [Table 4](#c0113n00029)). While adverse effects (e.g., sedation) may limit their use in acute diarrhea, patients usually develop tolerance to these effects with chronic use. Antimotility effects are not desired if the diarrhea is caused by microorganisms because gastrointestinal stasis may enhance the infection.​[[13]](#c0113n00034)​[[17]](#c0113n00035) Codeine offers the additional effects of sedation and analgesia. Diphenoxylate and loperamide have fewer CNS side effects than other opioids. Diphenoxylate is combined with atropine to limit its potential for abuse. Loperamide has the lowest incidence of side effects, is available without prescription, and is effective in patients with ileorectal pouch incontinence and radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Combining loperamide with simethicone provides faster and more complete relief of acute diarrhea associated with gas-related abdominal discomfort.​[[18]](#c0113n00203) While CNS effects are not observed at recommended doses, there are reports of loperamide being abused as an opioid substitute, either to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve a feeling of euphoria. The supratherapeutic doses (50–300 mg) taken to achieve CNS opioid effects have been associated with cardiac dysrhythmias and death.​[[12]](#refitem-1162114-D8FB7793)​[[19]](#refitem-1172118-14BC6B07) Typical symptoms of opioid toxicity may also be present.​[[20]](#refitem-1172119-14BC6D93) Health-care practitioners should exercise caution when recommending or providing loperamide to patients with a risk of, or history of, opioid abuse.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts.​[[21]](#Su2020AGAguidelines) It should be noted that within species, different strains of microbes can have widely different biological activities. Furthermore, many effects of these microbiota are strain- and dose-specific. Although there have been multiple studies examining probiotics for various conditions, including C. difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, there are still significant knowledge gaps. It has been difficult to draw conclusions from meta-analyses or systematic reviews because of differences in strains and doses of microbes used, study design (e.g., included populations, follow-up durations, end points and outcomes), and relatively small sample sizes. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of probiotics as part of clinical practice.​[[21]](#Su2020AGAguidelines)

### Clostridioides difficile Infection

Management of C. difficile–associated diarrhea consists of the following key steps: diagnose C. difficile infection (CDI), prevent spread, cease causative antibiotic, implement supportive measures in severe cases (hospitalization, rehydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances) and eradicate CDI.

Eradication therapy is required in patients with symptoms (usually diarrhea) and confirmed diagnosis of CDI (positive stool test for C. difficile toxin) or visual confirmation of pseudomembranous colitis. Therapy may be initiated prior to confirmed diagnosis in the presence of high clinical suspicion and severe symptoms. There is no evidence to support screening for asymptomatic C. difficile carriers.​[[10]](#c0113n00230)

[Table 3](#n00284) outlines the assessment and management of CDI. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are the preferred agents for an initial episode of CDI; metronidazole may be considered for nonsevere CDI only.​[[10]](#c0113n00230)​[[22]](#Beinortas2018)

A first CDI relapse will occur in approximately 25% of patients and should be managed based upon the choice of first-line therapy used.​[[10]](#c0113n00230) A second relapse should be investigated for other causes of diarrhea and, if C. difficile is confirmed, treated with a tapered or pulsed vancomycin oral regimen; a standard vancomycin regimen followed by rifaximin therapy; or a standard fidaxomicin regimen. For a third or subsequent recurrence, consider referral for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).​[[10]](#c0113n00230)

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of donor stool from a healthy individual to a sick patient, either by colonoscopy or oral capsule delivery. It has been shown to restore intestinal dysbiosis and is highly effective in treating recurrent CDI with a success rate of at least 90% after a single treatment.​[[23]](#Kelly2016)​[[24]](#Kao2017)​[[25]](#Staley2017)​[[26]](#Kelly2021) There is retrospective evidence suggesting that FMT has mortality benefit in severe CDI, but not in nonsevere cases.​[[27]](#Tixier2019)​[[28]](#Cheng2020) The short-term safety profile has been excellent; however, there have been a few case reports of FMT resulting in infectious transmission, including transmission of multi-drug resistant E. coli and toxin-producing E. coli.​[[29]](#DeFilipp2019) Such risks can be mitigated by more rigorous donor screening. Although Health Canada considers FMT to be an investigational new biologic drug, there is a policy in place that permits FMT outside of a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI not responsive to conventional therapies.​[[30]](#refitem-1162144-D76C3D9E) Despite this provision, access to FMT is still limited, partly due to restrictions set by regional health authorities and partly due to a lack of funding. Investigations of products to eliminate potential risks due to changes in donor health are in early stages of investigation.​[[31]](#Kao2021)

Bezlotoxumab is a therapeutic adjunct for recurrent CDI which is available in the United States but not yet in Canada. It is a human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B that has proven more effective than placebo in reducing the rates of recurrent CDI following a course of standard anti-CDI therapy.​[[32]](#refitem-1162139-D768A78F)

For patients requiring treatment with antimicrobials during or shortly after the completion of their C. difficile therapy, concomitant oral vancomycin can be considered until the antimicrobials are stopped. A retrospective study found vancomycin prophylaxis in this context to be an effective strategy for decreasing the risk of further CDI recurrence in patients re-exposed to antibiotics.​[[33]](#refitem-1142139-99903ABD)

There is no role for probiotic monotherapy in the acute treatment or prevention of CDI in adults and children;​[[34]](#c0113n00146) however, the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii may be marginally effective when used in conjunction with antibiotic treatment to prevent C. difficile recurrence.​[[35]](#c0113n00205)​[[36]](#c0113n00207) There is no evidence that adding cholestyramine, colestipol or rifampin to the antibiotic treatment regimen decreases the risk of further recurrence, and resins are contraindicated with antibiotics since they can bind to and sequester antibiotics in the gut.​[[10]](#c0113n00230)

Antimotility agents should be avoided in symptomatic CDI because their use increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon.​[[37]](#c0113n00208)

**Table 3:** Assessment and Management of Clostridioides difficile Infection​[[10]](#c0113n00230)

| Severity | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Non-severe disease | Vancomycin 125 mg QID PO × 10 days or Fidaxomicin 200 mg BID PO × 10 days or (if vancomycin or fidaxomicin unavailable) Metronidazole 500 mg TID PO × 10 days |
| Severe disease | Vancomycin 125 mg QID PO × 10 days or Fidaxomicin 200 mg BID PO × 10 days |
| Fulminant disease | Vancomycin 500 mg QID PO + Metronidazole 500 mg Q8H IV + (if ileus present) Vancomycin 500 mg in 100 mL saline Q6H PR as retention enema |
| First recurrence | If metronidazole used for initial episode: Vancomycin 125 mg QID PO × 10 days If vancomycin used for initial episode: Fidaxomicin 200 mg BID PO × 10 days If vancomycin standard regimen used for initial episode: Vancomycin tapered and pulsed regimen: Vancomycin 125 mg QID PO × 10–14 days Vancomycin 125 mg BID PO × 7 days Vancomycin 125 mg once daily PO × 7 days Vancomycin 125 mg Q2–3 days PO × 2–8 wk |
| Second recurrence | Vancomycin tapered and pulsed regimen Vancomycin 125 mg QID PO × 10 days; followed by rifaximin 400 mg TID PO × 20 days or Fidaxomicin 200 mg BID PO × 10 days |
| Third or subsequent recurrence | As per second recurrence or Fecal microbiota transplantation |

### Chronic Diarrhea

See [Infectious Diarrhea](#c0113n00153) for a discussion of ORT and opioids.

### Hydrophilic Bulking Agents

Although psyllium may reduce nonspecific diarrheal symptoms, its role in the management of diarrhea is limited. Many psyllium-containing products are combined with laxatives; avoid these products in patients with diarrhea.

Cholestyramine resin is useful in treating bile acid–induced diarrhea due to malabsorption of bile acids in diseased ileum (e.g., Crohn disease) or in some cases of irritable bowel syndrome where rapid transit results in loss of bile acids into the colon.

### Alpha2-adrenergic Agonists

Clonidine may be effective for diarrhea in irritable bowel syndrome, opioid withdrawal and diabetic autonomic neuropathy.​[[38]](#Fragkos2016) The dose required to achieve an antidiarrheal effect may be associated with sedation, dry mouth and orthostatic hypotension.

### Somatostatin Analogues

Somatostatin analogues can be administered subcutaneously daily (octreotide) or intramuscularly monthly (**octreotide acetate**, lanreotide **acetate**). These agents have been used to control diarrhea caused by neuroendocrine tumors (VIPoma, carcinoid, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid). Octreotide also limits idiopathic and infant secretory diarrhea, as well as diarrhea associated with ileostomy, short bowel syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, cryptosporidia, graft versus host disease and HIV infection.

Somatostatin has a short half-life and requires continuous IV infusion, which limits its role in the management of diarrhea.

### Public Health Considerations

- Due to their potential to transmit the infection to large numbers of persons, workers in food service or health care with diarrhea, such as food handlers and health-care workers who have direct patient contact should be tested for parasitic and bacterial pathogens.
- Similarly, daycare attendees and employees, or residents of an institutional facility (nursing home, psychiatric hospital, prison) with diarrhea should be tested for bacterial, parasitic or viral pathogens, since the diarrhea may be an indicator of an endemic outbreak.
- Physicians who suspect an endemic diarrheal disease outbreak should report their concern to public health authorities and work with them to initiate appropriate diagnostic testing to identify the pathogen and define the extent of the outbreak.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Bulk-forming agents, e.g., psyllium, are first choice in treating diarrhea in pregnancy.​[[39]](#Ferreira2013Pregnancy) Having limited human pregnancy data, loperamide is considered second line for treatment of diarrhea in pregnancy.​[[39]](#Ferreira2013Pregnancy) A prospective clinical trial of 89 patients exposed to loperamide in the first trimester of pregnancy found no increased risk of major malformations compared with matched controls.​[[40]](#Einarson2000) A retrospective analysis of 651 patients exposed to loperamide in early pregnancy found a slightly increased risk of malformation, although many treatment parameters were unknown and multitesting impacted results.​[[41]](#Schaefer2014Pregnancy)​[[42]](#Kallen2008) Diphenoxylate/​atropine should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding since it has been found to be teratogenic in animals​[[43]](#c0113n00241) and its active metabolite is probably excreted in breast milk.​[[43]](#c0113n00241)

Cholestyramine is used to treat cholestasis of pregnancy and can be used to manage diarrhea resulting from ileal resection or cholecystectomy.​[[44]](#c0113n00242) Use it with caution during pregnancy or breastfeeding since fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and coagulopathy can occur. Avoid bismuth subsalicylate in pregnancy because salicylates can be absorbed and may lead to increased perinatal mortality, premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, neonatal hemorrhage, decreased birth weight, prolonged gestation and labour, and possible teratogenicity.​[[45]](#c0113n00243) Salicylates should be used cautiously while breastfeeding since they are transferred into breast milk.

Metronidazole is not associated with congenital malformations.​[[46]](#c0113n00244)​[[47]](#c0113n00245)​[[48]](#c0113n00246) It is transferred into breast milk, and breastfeeding should be suspended until treatment with this drug is completed.​[[49]](#c0113n00247) Vancomycin has not been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant patients. There is limited human data on its use while breastfeeding, but it is probably safe.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Infectious diarrhea can be prevented by following simple rules of personal hygiene and safe food preparation. Handwashing with soap is an effective step in preventing spread of the illness and should be emphasized for both patients and their caregivers.
- It is critical that patients understand the importance of a balanced electrolyte oral rehydration solution in preventing and treating dehydration, and that they are aware that non-balanced electrolyte solutions will not achieve rehydration.
- Specific **vaccines** are available for prevention of diarrhea due to cholera (Vibrio cholerae) and enterotoxigenic E. coli in adults and children (see Travellers' Diarrhea), typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi) in adults and children, and rotavirus​[[50]](#Soares-Weiser2019) in infants.

| bismuth subsalicylate Pepto-Bismol , generics <$5 | 30 mL (17.6 mg BSS/mL) Q30 min PO to a maximum of 8 doses/day | Salicylate toxicity, black tongue, black stool, bismuth-induced encephalopathy. | Decreases absorption of fluoroquinolones, doxycycline and tetracycline. | Caution with use in renal insufficiency. |
| bismuth subsalicylate with calcium carbonate Pepto-Bismol Chewable Tablets <$5 | 2 tablets (262 mg BSS/tablet) Q30 min PO to a maximum of 8 doses/day | Salicylate toxicity, black tongue, black stool, bismuth-induced encephalopathy. Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria. | Decreases absorption of fluoroquinolones, doxycycline and tetracycline. | Caution with use in renal insufficiency. |

**Drug Class: Opioids**

| codeine generics <$5 | 30–60 mg Q4H PRN PO | Sedation, nausea, tolerance; potentially addictive. | Additive CNS depression with CNS depressants. | Elderly may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects. |
| diphenoxylate /​ atropine sulfate Lomotil <$5 | 5 mg PO initially then 2.5 mg PO after each loose bowel movement (maximum of 20 mg/day ) | Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps, dry skin and mucous membranes (from atropine); some addiction potential. | Additive anticholinergic effects with other anticholinergic agents. | Elderly are more susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of atropine, e.g., agitation, drowsiness, increased intraocular pressure. |
| loperamide Imodium , generics <$5 | 2 mg PO after each loose bowel movement (maximum of 16 mg/day ) | Sedation, nausea, abdominal cramps. Lowest addiction potential of all opioids. |  | Reports of loperamide being abused as an opioid substitute; higher than recommended doses can lead to cardiac dysrhythmia and death.​ [12] |

**Drug Class: Resins**

| cholestyramine resin Cholestyramine-Odan , other generics <$5 | 4 g Q12H PO | Nausea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency with long-term use, constipation. | May bind drugs, e.g., digoxin, in GI tract; administer other medications at least 1 h before or 4–6 h after cholestyramine. | Take with fluids. |

**Drug Class: Somatostatin Analogues**

| lanreotide acetate Somatuline autogel $1,400/month | 60 mg monthly IM | Pain at injection site, nausea, mild diarrhea. | Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can occur as a result of inhibition of insulin and glucagon secretion. Monitor blood glucose concentrations when lanreotide therapy is initiated or dosage adjusted in patients with diabetes mellitus. Adjust dose of antidiabetic agents as necessary. |  |
| octreotide acetate Sandostatin , generics $20–25 | 50–500 mcg Q12H SC | Pain at injection site, nausea, mild diarrhea. | Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can occur as a result of altered balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, e.g., insulin, glucagon, growth hormone. Adjustment of the dosage of drugs affecting glucose metabolism may be required following initiation of therapy. | Monitor glucose tolerance and antidiabetic treatment periodically. |
| octreotide acetate, long-acting Sandostatin LAR , generics $1,000–$1,700/month | 10–30 mg monthly IM | Pain at injection site, nausea, mild diarrhea. | Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can occur as a result of altered balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, e.g., insulin, glucagon, growth hormone. Adjustment of the dosage of drugs affecting glucose metabolism may be required following initiation of therapy. | Monitor glucose tolerance and antidiabetic treatment periodically. |
