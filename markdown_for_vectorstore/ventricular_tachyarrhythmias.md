CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women” and “men” as well as “female” and “male” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

### Introduction

*Ventricular tachycardia* (VT) is usually defined as ≥3 consecutive ventricular complexes at a rate >100 bpm on an ECG recording. VT can be a clinically unimportant, asymptomatic event or a life-threatening arrhythmia. *Ventricular fibrillation* (VF) is defined as a rapid, disorganized rhythm without recognizable QRS complexes on the ECG. VF is invariably associated with cardiovascular collapse and is almost always fatal unless the patient is electrically defibrillated.

This chapter describes a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients with documented VF, VT or cardiac arrest. Medication-induced QT prolongation is also reviewed.

### Goals of Therapy

- Relieve symptoms, including restoring a perfusing rhythm as quickly as possible in cases of sustained VT, VF or cardiac arrest​[[1]](#c0030n00141)
- Prevent the potentially fatal occurrence or recurrence of sustained VT or VF​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

### Investigations

- Careful history with special reference to:​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

  - syncope or severe presyncope
  - angina or heart failure symptoms
  - history suggesting structural heart disease, especially prior MI or heart failure
  - symptom correlation with exercise or stress
  - recent ingestion of medications that might cause or contribute to arrhythmias, e.g., antiarrhythmics, drugs that prolong the QT interval ([Drug-induced QT Prolongation and Arrhythmia Risk](#topic-11041-D5C214D3))
  - family history of sudden death (or VT/VF), especially at age <65; consider referral for genetic testing of known heritable disorders
- Physical examination for signs of structural heart disease e.g., cardiomyopathy, or valvular or hypertensive heart disease
- Assessment for electrolyte abnormalities e.g., K, Ca, Mg
- 12-lead ECG:

  - signs of prior MI or ongoing ischemia
  - repolarization abnormalities (short or prolonged QT interval, ECG signs of Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome, T wave inversions)
  - *Note:* a 12-lead ECG documenting VT is very helpful; if available, an ECG at tachycardia onset (or offset) is also very useful
- Echocardiogram with special reference to:

  - left ventricular size and function
  - right ventricular size
- Consider Holter or loop event recorder monitoring with special reference to:

  - presence and morphology of ventricular ectopy and symptom-rhythm correlation
- Treadmill exercise test with special reference to:

  - exercise-induced VT
  - ECG signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia (or scintigraphic evidence of ischemia, if necessary)
- Other tests: signal-averaged ECG, cardiac MRI (to assess cardiac structure and scar), provocative drug testing (isoproterenol for long QT, procainamide for Brugada syndrome) if structural heart disease is absent.

In some patients, the documented arrhythmia is a wide-complex tachycardia, and it may not be clear if this represents VT or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. All wide-complex tachycardias (QRS duration ≥0.12 s) in patients over 50 years of age should be considered VT until proven otherwise. Wide-complex tachycardia in an older patient with a history of heart disease is almost always VT, regardless of the morphology of ECG complexes. Most wide-complex tachycardias in any patient of any age group are due to VT.

### Significance of VT/VF

The clinical and prognostic importance and management of VT depends on whether it is sustained or nonsustained and whether there is associated structural heart disease, particularly left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Asymptomatic: Asymptomatic VT usually consists of nonsustained short episodes (3–10 beats). It is often discovered during routine screening ECG or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In the absence of structural heart disease, nonsustained VT is associated with a very low risk of significant cardiac events or subsequent sustained VT. In the presence of structural heart disease, especially left ventricular dysfunction, asymptomatic VT (usually nonsustained) may indicate a risk of future serious, symptomatic, sustained VT or VF.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

Symptomatic: Symptoms may include palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, presyncope, loss of consciousness or cardiac arrest. The severity of symptoms does not determine the prognostic importance of VT and its management, e.g., even severe symptoms in a patient with nonsustained VT and no structural heart disease are prognostically benign; such patients require reassurance, but not necessarily specific antiarrhythmic therapy.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

Cardiac arrest: Most episodes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are likely the result of VF, although the initial cardiac rhythm documented by first responders is often asystole. VF almost always leads to cardiac arrest, whereas sustained VT may lead to collapse or cardiac arrest after a variable duration, usually 1 to several minutes.

Sustained VT: Lasts ≥30 seconds or requires immediate medical intervention. For management decisions, >15 seconds is a reasonable working definition. It is most often associated with structural heart disease, typically coronary disease with previous MI. Sustained VT with structural heart disease requires investigation and therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs, an implanted cardioverter defibrillator or radiofrequency ablation. Sustained VT with no structural heart disease (idiopathic VT) usually requires therapy if symptomatic or if polymorphic. Treatment of asymptomatic VT in someone with no structural heart disease is individualized. Totally asymptomatic short salvos of VT may not need any treatment; however, in sustained VT, even in the absence of symptoms, careful evaluation is required and treatment may be indicated.

Nonsustained VT: Lasts <30 seconds, usually only a few seconds. Most commonly there are <10 consecutive ventricular complexes. Unless symptomatic, it requires treatment only if the likelihood of subsequent sustained VT or cardiac arrest is high, e.g., ejection fraction <35% or associated with marked QT prolongation.

VT associated with structural heart disease (e.g., coronary, valvular or hypertensive heart disease): Usually symptomatic and associated with a high risk of sudden death or recurrence (if sustained) or asymptomatic and associated with at least a moderate risk of sudden death (if nonsustained). The magnitude of left ventricular dysfunction is the most important prognostic factor.

VT associated with a structurally normal heart: May be symptomatic but rarely is life-threatening, even if sustained; it requires no therapy if asymptomatic and nonsustained.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

Monomorphic VT: Usually implies an abnormal automatic focus in the ventricle or a fixed re-entrant pathway associated with a scar. It does not by itself suggest prognosis or therapy and in a structurally normal heart does not necessarily require treatment.

Polymorphic VT: Usually presents as polymorphic VT between 3–20 beats, often in repetitive salvos. Consider myocardial ischemia and abnormalities of repolarization (torsades de pointes: VT associated with QTc prolongation and a characteristic long-short initiating sequence).​[[1]](#c0030n00141) Polymorphic VT, especially if occurring with exercise, in the presence of structural disease, or with QT prolongation, often implies a high risk of sustained VT or cardiac arrest and requires careful investigation.

Ventricular fibrillation: Most patients with VF are at high risk of recurrence. These individuals should be investigated in a similar fashion to patients with sustained VT and should be treated to prevent recurrences.​[[1]](#c0030n00141) The most common underlying cause is coronary artery disease (CAD), often with prior MI, with or without acute ischemia or infarction. VF may complicate acute MI; however, the prognosis for resuscitated patients with VF occurring during the first 48 hours post-MI is similar to that in patients with an infarction of equivalent severity uncomplicated by VF.

### Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Arrhythmia Risk

### QT Interval and Risk of Arrhythmia

QT interval is defined on surface ECG as the interval between initiation of QRS complex and the termination of T wave. This interval is composed of the time from beginning of ventricular muscle contraction to the end of its relaxation. It is used as a surrogate for cardiac muscle repolarization time.

QT interval seems simple to measure, but in practice, accurate measurement of QT can be an intricate task. QRS prolongation, variability of QT interval in different ECG leads (spatial QT dispersion), ambiguity in the terminal part of T wave, biphasic or bifid T waves, merging of the final part of T wave with the subsequent P wave, and presence of a U wave are all circumstances that add to the complexity of this apparently simple measurement. It is therefore not surprising that significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability of QT measurement, even between experts, have been reported.​[[2]](#AhmadKDorianP.Drug-inducedQTProlong-D6519F92)

The QT interval is not constant for a given individual. It changes dynamically under the influence of numerous factors like body position, sleep, autonomic tone and electrolyte balance. Heart rate is the factor with the most influence on QT interval. QT interval lengthens with decreasing heart rate and shortens as heart rate increases. Multiple formulae have been developed to account for these rate-related changes and reveal the “time invariant” underlying QT interval. Although not perfectly accurate, one of the most commonly used QT correction methods in clinical practice is Bazett formula ([Table 1](#Bazettx2019sFormula-D6C6D7CD)). The resulting “corrected” QT is called the QTc. Bazett formula undercorrects at fast heart rates (e.g., >100/min); as a result a QTc >480 msec may be seen with normal repolarization at fast heart rates.

**Table 1:** Bazett Formula

| Corrected QT (QT c ) | = | QT interval in seconds |
| √R-R interval in seconds |

The American Heart Association defines a prolonged QTc interval as ≥470 milliseconds in men and ≥480 milliseconds in women.​[[3]](#VinkA.SEtAl.DeterminationAndInterpr-D651A247)

Prolongation of repolarization time and its dispersion in different parts of the heart increase the likelihood of initiation and perpetuation of a particular kind of ventricular arrhythmia, a form of polymorphic VT called torsades de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually a self-limiting tachycardia, but it can last long enough to cause hemodynamic instability or degenerate into VF and cause sudden cardiac death.

The risk of TdP increases proportionally, but not in a linear relationship, with prolongation of QTc. It is of greatest concern when QTc is greater than 500 milliseconds or when the QTc increases more than 60 milliseconds from the baseline value.

QT prolongation can be congenital. Pathogenic variants of multiple genes, encoding cardiac ion channels, have been identified to affect QT interval and cause congenital long QT (LQT) syndromes. Patients with congenital LQT may suffer ventricular arrhythmias, syncope or, more rarely, sudden death. Patients with congenital LQT syndrome should avoid QT-prolonging drugs throughout their lives. Moreover, some non-QT-prolonging medications can increase the risk of adverse cardiac events in these patients. For example, Na-channel blocking antiseizure medications are not classified as QT-prolonging drugs; however, they increase risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with type 2 but not type 1 LQT syndrome.​[[4]](#AuerbachD.SEtAl.RiskOfCardiacEvents-D651A59F)

Acquired conditions can be responsible for lengthening of QT interval. These conditions include bradycardia, especially complete heart block, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), hypothermia, hypothyroidism, toxins such as organophosphates, intracranial pathologies, myocardial ischemia and HIV infection.

### Medications and QT Prolongation

Medications are the most common cause of QT prolongation. Both antiarrhythmic and noncardiac medications can prolong the QT interval. Most do so by acting on a repolarizing potassium channel called IKr. An updated list of QT-prolonging drugs is available from [CredibleMeds](https://www.crediblemeds.org/index.php?rf=All).

The major classes of medications that cause QT prolongation are listed in [Table 2](#DrugsAssociatedWithQTProlongation-2F5D4484).

**Table 2:** Drug Classes Commonly Associated With QT Prolongation

| Class | Drug |
| Antiarrhythmics | Amiodarone, disopyramide, flecainide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol (see text for further discussion of antiarrhythmic drugs) |
| Antibiotics (quinolone, macrolide) | Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin |
| Antidepressants | Citalopram, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline)​ [a] |
| Antiemetics | Domperidone, ondansetron |
| Antifungals (azole) | Fluconazole, itraconazole |
| Antihistamines | Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine​ [b] |
| Antipsychotics | Typical (e.g., haloperidol, thioridazine) and atypical (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) agents |
| Chemotherapy agents | Oxaliplatin,​ [c] small molecule inhibitors (e.g., arsenic trioxide, CKD4/6 inhibitors, panobinostat, tyrosine kinase inhibitors​ [7] ) |
| General anesthetics | Propofol, sevoflurane |
| Opioid analgesic | Methadone |

[a] The risk of QT prolongation is higher with these agents compared to other antidepressants in older adults.​[[5]](#RochesterM.PEtAl.EvaluatingTheRiskO-D651AAE8)​[[6]](#DanielssonBEtAl.AntidepressantsAndA-D651AD62)

[b] Has rarely been associated with QT prolongation at high doses in the presence of other risk factors (bradycardia, low serum K or Mg, and excessive dose).

[c] In patients treated with conventional cancer medications, QTc >500 milliseconds, arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death was extremely rare.​[[7]](#Porta-SanchezAEtAl.IncidenceDiagnos-D651A840)

The following are antiarrhythmic medications with QT-prolonging effect:

- Quinidine is a class IA drug that blocks both sodium and potassium channels. Its QT-prolonging effect is more pronounced in slow heart rates and the risk is greatest during the 24 hours of drug initiation. Quinidine can prolong QT in a dose-dependent manner or as an idiosyncratic reaction.
- Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic that prolongs QT and may cause TdP, mainly because of the potassium channel blocking activity of its major metabolite, N-acetyl procainamide.
- Disopyramide is a class IA medication with anticholinergic activity that can prolong QT interval. TdP with the use of disopyramide has been reported.
- Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug that mainly blocks sodium channels in a use-dependent pattern. It has been shown that flecainide can cause bradycardia and it can also decrease potassium channel activity in a “reverse-use dependent” pattern; however, there is lack of compelling evidence that flecainide can cause TdP in the absence of heart block and other causes of QT prolongation.
- Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug with class I, II and IV activity. Despite the fact that amiodarone frequently induces QT prolongation, amiodarone-related TdP is infrequent. The low incidence of TdP with amiodarone may be attributed to other antiarrhythmic characteristics of this medication such as blocking calcium channels.
- Ibutilide is a class III medication that is only administered intravenously in a hospital. It prolongs QT in a dose-dependent relation. Maximum QT prolongation happens at the end of infusion and it will return to baseline within 4 hours of infusion. The risk of TdP with ibutilide in the clinical trials is between 1% and 4%. Therefore, baseline QTc and potassium level should be assessed before initiation of infusion. In addition, patients should be monitored in hospital for 4 hours after the infusion.
- Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug with beta-blocking properties. It blocks potassium channels, shows reverse-use dependence and markedly prolongs QT. It is the drug most often associated with QT prolongation in registry studies. There is a near linear relationship between sotalol dosage and QT prolongation, with a sharp increase in the risk of arrhythmia in dosages higher than 320 mg per day.

Most medications that prolong the QT interval and with a proven risk of TdP rarely lead to arrhythmias. The excess risk of most noncardiac drugs that prolong the QT is much less than 1/1000 patient years.​[[8]](#MoellerJRGumminDDNelsonTJEtAl.RiskO-12817458) This association may not be entirely due to the drugs but may be a reflection of the underlying illness being treated.

The risk of serious proarrhythmia with any noncardiac QT-prolonging drug is very low unless the QT interval is greater than 500–520 milliseconds (uncorrected).​[[9]](#HasnainMViewegVW.QTcIntervalProlong-D651B010)​[[10]](#RayWAEtAl.OralErythromycinAndTheRis-D651B235)​[[11]](#CzajaASValuckRJAndersonHD.Comparati-D651B53A)

The extent of QT prolongation and the probability of TdP depends on patient risk factors. The most common added risk factors are female sex, older age, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, higher drug dosage, concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications, and medical conditions that can affect drug metabolism.​[[12]](#DrewB.JEtAl.PreventionOfTorsadeDePo-D651B7C9)​[[13]](#CoughtrieALEtAl.DrugsAndLife-threat-D651BACA)​[[14]](#TisdaleJEEtAl.DevelopmentAndValidat-D651BDA0) These possible risk factors are presented in [Table 3](#RiskFactorsForTorsadesDePointes-2F5DC108).

**Table 3:** Risk Factors for Torsades de Pointes

| Patient Related | Medical Conditions | Drug Related |
| Age >67 y | Anorexia nervosa, hypothyroidism, starvation | Altered drug metabolism, e.g., renal or liver failure |
| Bradycardia (heart rate <45 beats/min) | Congenital long QT syndrome | Loop diuretics |
| Female sex | Electrolyte disturbances including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia |  |
| First 24 h after cardiac arrest, syncope or seizure | Family history of sudden cardiac death |  |
| First 7 days after acute coronary syndrome | Heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) |  |
| First 7 days after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm | Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |  |
| First 7 days after stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage or head trauma | Hypoglycemia (documented and in absence of diabetes) |  |
|  | Pheochromocytoma |  |
|  | Sepsis |  |

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

### Immediate Therapy for Sustained VT or VF

If a patient with sustained monomorphic VT is unstable (e.g., has hypotension, angina, heart failure or marked symptoms), cardioversion is effective and safe.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)​[[15]](#c0030n00009) A synchronized biphasic shock is usually effective for VT. If immediate conversion to sinus rhythm is not considered necessary, antiarrhythmic drug therapy can be given.​[[15]](#c0030n00009)

For polymorphic VT or VF, an immediate nonsynchronized shock is required; repeat every 2 minutes if necessary (with minimum interruptions in CPR), increasing shock energy if shocks fail (if possible), until defibrillation is achieved.

### Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT or VF Recurrence

Therapeutic choices for long-term management of sustained VT or VF (see [Figure 1](#c0030n00002), [Figure 2](#c0030n00003)) include both drug therapy (see [Table 4](#c0030n00039)) and nondrug therapy (implanted cardioverter defibrillator, catheter ablation, map-guided endocardial resection, stereotactic cardiac radioablation).​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

An implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is very effective in terminating episodes of VT or VF.​[[1]](#c0030n00141) Current guidelines recommend an ICD as preferred treatment in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, VF or sustained VT not due to a reversible cause.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)​[[16]](#c0030n00140) Multiple studies have demonstrated the mortality benefit of ICDs in these patients. The AVID trial reported a 39% reduction in total mortality after 1 year in ICD-treated patients relative to antiarrhythmic therapy (primarily amiodarone).​[[17]](#c0030n00015)

Although ICDs are effective in terminating episodes of VT, they do not provide long-term prevention of recurrent arrhythmias. Consequently, alternative interventions such as catheter ablation or pharmacotherapy (see [Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT/VF Recurrence](#c0030n00186)) remain central to the management strategy for preventing subsequent VT episodes in this group of patients.

Catheter ablation is considered first-line therapy for patients with structurally normal hearts​[[1]](#c0030n00141) and, in addition to beta-blocker therapy, for selected patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.​[[18]](#DeyellMWAbdelWahabAAngaranPEtAl.202-711C7665) Success is generally highest in patients with hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT and those with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction.​[[19]](#KuckKHSchaumannAEckardtLEtAl.Cathet-711B7BB8)

Compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation:

- Is generally comparable to amiodarone and superior to other agents such as sotalol​[[18]](#DeyellMWAbdelWahabAAngaranPEtAl.202-711C7665)
- Is more effective than escalating drug therapy for patients with refractory VT​[[20]](#SappJLWellsGAParkashREtAl.Ventricul-711BD923)
- Demonstrated advantages over drug therapy in the recent VANISH-2 trial when used early in the course of treatment for patients with VT and ischemic cardiomyopathy​[[21]](#SappJLTangASLParkashREtAl.CatheterA-711C2B9C)

Another approach to reducing the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia in selected patients with structural heart disease is stereotactic cardiac radioablation. This technique remains largely investigational and is not widely available. It is typically reserved as a last resort for patients whose ventricular tachycardia is refractory to other treatment options.

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Immediate Therapy for Sustained VT or VF

Amiodarone**:** IV amiodarone is moderately, but rarely immediately, effective in terminating VT and is especially effective in preventing early recurrence. It is likely the most effective therapy for electrical storm (characterized by frequent recurrences of VT/VF) and is probably useful in shock-resistant VF.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)​[[15]](#c0030n00009) There are few randomized studies to guide dosing. The dose recommended in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines is a 300 mg IV bolus followed by a 150 mg IV bolus, if required.​[[15]](#c0030n00009)​[[22]](#KudenchukPJBrownSPDayaMEtAl.Amiodar-9D390C60) Alternatively, 3–5 mg/kg IV over 5–10 minutes followed by a 0.5–1 mg/minute infusion can be used. The product monograph recommends 150 mg IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 mg/minute for 6 hours then 0.5 mg/minute for 18 hours.​[[23]](#c0030n00142) If necessary, an ongoing infusion of 0.5–1 mg/min can be continued for 24–48 hours. Hypotension may occur, especially if the drug is administered very rapidly. Administration through a central line, if possible, can avoid the development of phlebitis.

Procainamide**:** 10–15 mg/kg IV over 30–45 minutes will often slow VT and terminate tachycardia. It is indicated for monomorphic VT, not polymorphic VT. Hypotension may occur, especially at more rapid infusion rates, and BP should be carefully monitored.​[[15]](#c0030n00009)

Magnesium**:** 2–5 g IV over 3–5 minutes is the treatment of choice for torsades de pointes VT and may be useful in the presence of myocardial ischemia. It is probably of no benefit in monomorphic VT.​[[1]](#c0030n00141) Magnesium is generally safe, but may rarely cause hypotension.

Beta1-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers): IV beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, propranolol, esmolol) can prevent VT or VF in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia, recent MI or electrical storm​[[1]](#c0030n00141). Bradycardia or hypotension may occur. There is some evidence that during electrical storm, propranolol is superior to metoprolol.​[[24]](#RostonTChuaDLumEEtAl.SwitchingBetwe-1286542C)

Lidocaine**:** 1–1.5 mg/kg IV followed by a 1–3 mg/minute infusion is occasionally effective (in <20% of cases of sustained monomorphic VT).​[[1]](#c0030n00141) If conversion does not occur within 10–15 minutes, lidocaine will probably not be effective. Results of a large, randomized controlled trial suggests it may increase the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in shock-resistant VF.​[[22]](#KudenchukPJBrownSPDayaMEtAl.Amiodar-9D390C60) Lidocaine rarely causes hypotension, and at high doses can cause CNS adverse events.

### Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT/VF Recurrence

Sustained monomorphic VT/VF is likely to recur in the absence of treatment. Objective documentation of treatment efficacy (e.g., electrophysiologic testing or reduction of VT episodes on Holter monitoring) can be considered. In patients with LV dysfunction, drug therapy should rarely be used as the only therapy for the prevention of recurrent sustained VT (secondary prevention) or prevention of first occurrence of VT in at-risk patients (primary prophylaxis). ICD implantation is superior to drug therapy in this setting.​[[1]](#c0030n00141)

Indicators that have been used historically to assess efficacy of drugs in individual patients include the ability to prevent induction of VT during an electrophysiologic study or with exercise, and elimination or marked reduction in the frequency of nonsustained VT episodes or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Such assessment of drug efficacy is of uncertain usefulness and currently rarely performed.

Patients with a history of VF or cardiac arrest are usually at high risk (20–30% per year) of recurrence of VF or VT, since their original arrhythmia may have been VT degenerating to VF. Their treatment is similar to that of patients with sustained VT, although markers to judge drug efficacy (inducible VT or VF; nonsustained VT on Holter monitoring) are present less often.

Beta-blockers have been demonstrated to suppress arrhythmias and reduce mortality associated with heart failure or following an MI. If tolerated, they are recommended for all patients in whom drug therapy is to be used.​[[25]](#c0030n00134) Consider the presence of other disease states when choosing a beta-blocker​[[24]](#RostonTChuaDLumEEtAl.SwitchingBetwe-1286542C) (see Heart Failure and Post-myocardial Infarction). Beta-blockers are particularly useful in patients with exercise-, stress- or ischemia-induced VT. Metoprolol is a reasonable choice in these patients based on clinical experience. Atenolol and bisoprolol are also frequently used, and their longer half-lives allow once-daily dosing. Doses used are based on large studies in post-MI and heart failure patients, and modified based on adverse effects and heart rate at rest and during exercise.

Amiodarone and sotalol are effective in preventing VT or VF, but almost all studies show they are less effective than implanted defibrillators in preventing sudden death and decreasing all-cause mortality in patients at high risk for sustained VT or VF.​[[26]](#BorneRTKatzDBetzJEtAl.ImplantableCa-128872DB) No randomized study has shown that antiarrhythmic drugs reduce mortality; however, amiodarone or sotalol can be used as an adjunct to ICD implantation to prevent ICD shocks, which are painful.​[[27]](#c0030n00010)

In patients with multiple, frequent recurrences of VT or VF (electrical storm) resistant to the combination of a beta-blocker and amiodarone, or if amiodarone is ineffective or not tolerated, Class I agents such as mexiletine or quinidine can be cautiously added. Such combinations are entirely empiric and should be used only as a last resort.​[[1]](#c0030n00141) In highly selected cases, empiric combinations of sotalol and quinidine,​[[28]](#c0030n00121) or quinidine and mexiletine,​[[29]](#c0030n00122) or other combinations of drugs with Class IA, IB and III activity can be considered. Quinidine is available only through the Health Canada Special Access Program and is rarely used.

### Therapeutic Approach in a Patient Needing QT-Prolonging Medications

Administration of a single QT-prolonging drug in a patient with no risk factors and short or normal baseline QTc is safe; however, in daily practice, patients with multiple risk factors who need 1 or more QT-prolonging medications are frequently encountered.

Automated decision-support systems have been developed to alert health-care providers to significant QTc prolongation. More data on their effectiveness and impact on overall patient outcomes are needed to justify the cost of implementation of such systems.​[[14]](#TisdaleJEEtAl.DevelopmentAndValidat-D651BDA0)​[[30]](#StraussDGEtAl.CommonGeneticVariantR-D651C33B)​[[31]](#VandaelEEtAl.DevelopmentOfARiskScor-D6B43D08)​[[32]](#VandaelE.EtAl.ASmartAlgorithmForThe-D651C5B0)​[[33]](#TomaselliMuenstermanETisdaleJE.Pred-D651C896)

Until development of a practical system with proven benefit, it is prudent to consider a stepwise approach when prescribing 1 or a combination of QT-prolonging drugs for high-risk patients.

A suggested approach in these circumstances includes the following steps:

- Initially, verify if the medication is on the QT-prolonging drug list and/or associated with TdP (see [Medications and QT Prolongation](#topic-110413-D5C33BF1)).
- Clarify if there is a personal or family history of ventricular arrhythmias, congenital LQT syndrome, syncope or sudden death. It is reasonable not to prescribe QT-prolonging medications for patients with congenital LQT syndrome.
- Review patient’s other medications or medical conditions, looking for high-risk features ([Table 3](#RiskFactorsForTorsadesDePointes-2F5DC108)) or any factor that can inhibit drug metabolism. In patients with multiple risk factors or concomitant administration of multiple QT-prolonging medications, assess the drug’s indication and evaluate if it can be safely replaced with a non-QT-prolonging medication. Risk scores for excessive QT prolongation and related arrhythmia risk have been developed.​[[34]](#TisdaleJE.Drug-inducedQTIntervalPro-1289E564)
- If, after careful assessment, high-risk patients need medication, treatment can begin with the lowest effective dose, followed by dose adjustment according to clinical indications.​[[35]](#BrouilletteJNattelS.APracticalAppro-D651CB01)
- Some authorities recommend ECG monitoring on initiation of QT-prolonging medications. This recommendation is not universal. Consider post-treatment ECG monitoring in patients starting these medications if the baseline QT interval is prolonged.​[[36]](#LambiasePDEtAl.BritishHeartRhythmSo-D651CD29) In that case, ECG should be repeated after 5 half-lives of prescribed drug or any dosage adjustment. There are no data to support the value of surveillance ECGs unless the baseline, pre-drug QTc is abnormal.
- A QTc interval of more than 500 milliseconds or QTc prolongation by more than 60 milliseconds warrants careful reassessment.
- Patients should be instructed to report any new symptoms (palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness) and report conditions that could lead to hypokalemia (gastroenteritis, diuretic therapy). Monitor for serum K and Mg in those on multiple QTc-prolonging therapies.

It is important to remember that using 2 or more QT-prolonging medications, even in high-risk patients, does not necessarily further prolong QT or cause cardiac arrhythmias. Studies that compared effect of mono versus poly QT-prolonging drug therapy on QT interval showed inconsistent results.​[[37]](#SumicJCEtAl.QTcAndPsychopharmacsAre-D651CF8C) In a study of 3442 patients treated with a QT-prolonging antibiotic, another drug known to cause TdP had been coadministered in 1332 patients (38.7%). In this study, 14% of patients were using more than 3 QT-prolonging drugs. Hypokalemia was also documented in 15.9% of these patients. However, no cases of TdP were noted.​[[38]](#NiedrigDEtAl.DrugSafetyOfMacrolideA-D651D2C9) Therefore, if indicated, we should not withhold necessary medications based entirely on fear of QT prolongation.

![](images/ventriculartachyarrythmias_lontermansusventacvenfibrescararr.gif)

[a] Sustained VT is usually defined as lasting >30 seconds or causing hemodynamic compromise. A 15-second cutoff is suggested since VT lasting longer than 15 seconds usually requires long-term treatment. Current guidelines​[[25]](#c0030n00134) indicate that in most cases an ICD is the preferred therapy for any patient with sustained VT and symptoms in the presence of structural heart disease (with no reversible cause). Electrophysiologic studies are not usually indicated in such patients. Cardiac catheterization may be reasonable but is also not necessarily indicated in such patients.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd1125492e1294) Patients with monomorphic VT.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd1125492e1297) An ICD should be considered for any patient with sustained VT, and most patients with VF or cardiac arrest. In addition to the therapies listed, all patients should receive beta-blockers unless contraindicated.

### Drug Table

**Table 4:** Drug Therapy for Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Beta1-Adrenergic Antagonists**

| atenolol Tenormin , generics < $25 | Initial: 50 mg/day Usual: 25–100 mg/day; once daily PO | Fatigue, bradycardia, AV block, decreased exercise capacity, headache, erectile dysfunction, vivid dreams. Less common: hyperglycemia, depression, heart failure. | With digoxin, Ca​ ++ channel blockers, amiodarone, reduce dose 25–50%. | Monitor carefully in patients with diabetes who are prone to hypoglycemia. Caution in patients with HF . Especially useful in exercise-induced VT , with ischemia or VT in the absence of structural heart disease. Of probable but unclear benefit in patients with sustained VT and prior MI . May enhance efficacy of other antiarrhythmic drugs in this setting. Very low proarrhythmic risk. Contraindicated in severe asthma. |
| bisoprolol generics < $25 | Initial: 5 mg/day Usual: 2.5–10 mg/day; once daily PO | Fatigue, bradycardia, AV block, decreased exercise capacity, headache, erectile dysfunction, vivid dreams. Less common: hyperglycemia, depression, heart failure. | With digoxin, Ca​ ++ channel blockers, amiodarone, reduce dose 25–50%. | Monitor carefully in patients with diabetes who are prone to hypoglycemia. Caution in patients with HF . Especially useful in exercise-induced VT , with ischemia or VT in the absence of structural heart disease. Of probable but unclear benefit in patients with sustained VT and prior MI . May enhance efficacy of other antiarrhythmic drugs in this setting. Very low proarrhythmic risk. Contraindicated in severe asthma. |
| metoprolol Apo-Metoprolol , other generics < $25 | Initial: 100 mg/day Usual: 100–400 mg/day; divided BID PO | Fatigue, bradycardia, AV block, decreased exercise capacity, headache, erectile dysfunction, vivid dreams. Less common: hyperglycemia, depression, heart failure. | With digoxin, Ca​ ++ channel blockers, amiodarone, reduce dose 25–50%. | Monitor carefully in patients with diabetes who are prone to hypoglycemia. Caution in patients with HF . Especially useful in exercise-induced VT , with ischemia or VT in the absence of structural heart disease. Of probable but unclear benefit in patients with sustained VT and prior MI . May enhance efficacy of other antiarrhythmic drugs in this setting. Very low proarrhythmic risk. Contraindicated in severe asthma. |

**Drug Class: Class IA Antiarrhythmics​[b]**

| quinidine generics ​ [c] | Usual: 800–1600 mg/day (sulfate equivalent) PO | Frequent GI intolerance, fever (rare), thrombocytopenia (rare). Torsades de pointes; (proarrhythmic) VT . | Reduce digoxin dose by 50%. Inhibits CYP2D6 and Pgp (many potential interactions). | Active metabolites accumulate in renal failure, but therapeutic blood monitoring is not readily available. Monitor ECG intervals to guide dosing decisions. |

**Drug Class: Class IB Antiarrhythmics​[b]**

| mexiletine generics $100–175 | Usual: 600–900 mg/day PO | Frequent CNS side effects. | Phenytoin and rifampin may reduce effect (may need to increase mexiletine dose). | Rarely used as monotherapy. |

**Drug Class: Class III Antiarrhythmics**

| sotalol generics < $25 | Usual: 160–480 mg/day PO Elderly: Reduce initial dose to 40 mg Q12H PO | Torsades de pointes, especially at higher doses or with renal dysfunction. Fatigue, bradycardia, AV block, decreased exercise capacity, headache, erectile dysfunction, vivid dreams. Less common: hyperglycemia, depression, heart failure. | Digoxin, verapamil, other beta-blockers may cause AV block, bradycardia. With digoxin, Ca​ ++ channel blockers, amiodarone, reduce dose 25–50%. | Sotalol is a beta-blocker. May be especially effective in exercise-related arrhythmias. Likely more effective than other drugs in suppressing inducibility of VT . Contraindicated in asthma. |
| amiodarone generics < $25 | Loading dose: 800–1600 mg/day PO for 7–10 days Maintenance dose: 200–400 mg/day PO Avoid high-loading dose in setting of sinus bradycardia (HR <50 BPM) | Various GI, dermatologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic and thyroid abnormalities. Pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic dysfunction and aggravation of arrhythmias are rare but potentially life-threatening. | Reduce digoxin dose by 50%. Reduce beta-blocker dose by 50%. Reduce quinidine or procainamide dose by 50%. Reduce warfarin dose by 50%. | Slows conduction, prolongs refractoriness, blocks adrenergic activity, blocks Ca​ ++ and K​ + channels. Very long half-life. Likely the most effective antiarrhythmic drug. Usually used empirically. |

[[a]](#fnsrc_drufnad1125492e1314) Cost of 30-day supply of mean dose unless otherwise specified; includes drug cost only.

[b] There is no evidence that any drug with primarily class I activity is of long-term benefit in reducing mortality from VT or VF; in particular, class I drugs are not recommended in patients with VT or VF and structural heart disease (in the absence of an ICD).

[c] Available only for idiopathic VT or Brugada syndrome through the Special Access Program, Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada.
