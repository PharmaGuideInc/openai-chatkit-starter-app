### Introduction

Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness associated with an inability to maintain postural tone, rapid and spontaneous recovery, and the absence of clinical features specific for another form of transient loss of consciousness such as epileptic seizure.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B) Probably over 50% of people have a syncopal episode, or faint, at least once in their lifetime, and many faint recurrently.​[[4]](#c0035n00127)​[[5]](#c0035n00104) Most people who faint have a benign cause but very few are at risk of death. Common causes of syncope are listed in [Table 1](#c0035n00012). The goal of patient assessment is to determine an etiologic diagnosis and related risk of adverse outcomes.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)

**Table 1:** Common Causes of Syncope

| Volume depletion | Reflex syncope syndromes |
| Diarrhea | Carotid sinus hypersensitivity |
| Diminished oral intake | Initial orthostatic hypotension |
| Polyuria | Situational syncope syndromes, e.g., cough, gelastic syncope |
| Drugs | Vasovagal syncope syndromes |
| Alcohol | Bradycardias |
| Antihypertensive drugs, e.g., alpha- and beta-blockers, vasodilators | Complete heart block |
| Antiparkinsonian drugs | Sinus node disease |
| Diuretics | Tachycardias |
| Nitrates | Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia |
| Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors | Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, including torsades de pointe |
| Second generation antipsychotics | Supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation |

| Tricyclic antidepressants | Aortic stenosis |
| Autonomic neuropathies | Pulmonary emboli |
| Central synucleinopathies, e.g., Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson disease, pure autonomic failure | Many other rare causes |
| Peripheral autonomic failure, e.g., amyloidosis, diabetes, uremia |  |

### Goals of Therapy

- Remove reversible causes of syncope
- Treat arrhythmic and obstructive causes of syncope
- Treat patients with therapies appropriate to the degree of their symptoms

### Investigations

- In patients with transient loss of consciousness, perform a complete cardiovascular and neurologic history and physical examination.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)
- Exclude nonsyncopal causes of loss of consciousness. Remember that cerebrovascular disorders rarely cause loss of consciousness without other neurologic symptoms.
- The Canadian Syncope Risk Score​[[6]](#c0035n00106) can be used to identify low-risk patients in the emergency department who can safely be discharged.
- Check the medication list for drugs that may cause hypotension (see [Table 1](#c0035n00012)) or be proarrhythmic.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)
- Tailor laboratory investigations to the individual patient:​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)

  - ECG is indicated for most patients and is relatively inexpensive
  - base tailored investigations on the ACC/AHA/HRS​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076) or European Society of Cardiology​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53) guidelines
  - younger patients with a secure diagnosis of vasovagal syncope based on the history do not require further investigation
  - unless contraindicated, carotid sinus massage should be performed in patients >50 years of age to screen for carotid sinus hypersensitivity (do not perform in patients with carotid bruits)
  - tilt table testing (procedure to assess the vasovagal response to changing from a supine to upright position) could be useful in patients with an uncertain diagnosis, uncertainty about syncope versus epileptic seizures, and uncertainty about faints versus falls in the elderly
  - older patients (>50 years of age) with diagnostic uncertainty should have extended ECG monitoring that may include either a 2-day admission, Holter monitoring or more prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring
  - implanted patient-activated loop recorders may be useful in patients with infrequent syncope that eludes previous attempts at diagnosis,​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B) but are very expensive​
  - refer patients with structural heart disease for electrophysiologic assessment
  - **do not** request brain MRI or CT scan, EEG, or carotid ultrasound investigations for assessment of syncope​[[7]](#c0035n00027)
- After potentially fatal causes are eliminated and reversible causes are removed, most patients will have 1 of several syndromes of orthostatic intolerance:​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)

  - reflex syncope syndromes
  - vasovagal syncope
  - initial orthostatic hypotension
  - autonomic neuropathies, either due to synucleinopathies or peripheral neuropathies.​[[8]](#c0035n00028) Consider a neurologic consult only in the case of primary autonomic failure
- The orthostatic intolerance syndromes can be distinguished based on history and a simple stand test in the office. To perform the stand test, first measure BP and heart rate after the patient has been supine for 5 minutes, then after 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes of standing. The following responses may be seen:

  - normal response and vasovagal syncope: modest rise in heart rate (about 10 BPM) and BP (about 10 mm Hg)
  - autonomic failure: progressive fall in BP of ≥20 mm Hg systolic or ≥10 mm Hg diastolic with development of presyncope; blunted or no increase in heart rate

See [Figure 1](#c0035n00006) for a summary of the diagnostic approach to syncope. See [Vasovagal Syncope](#c0035n00052) and [Orthostatic Hypotension](#c0035n00054) for management of these conditions.

### Vasovagal Syncope

### Introduction

Vasovagal syncope is a syncope syndrome that usually occurs with an upright posture held for more than 30 seconds or with exposure to emotional stress, pain or medical settings. Features include diaphoresis, warmth, nausea and pallor. It is associated with hypotension and relative bradycardia and is followed by fatigue.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Reassure the patient that vasovagal syncope is not life-threatening and that it is a physical problem, not a psychiatric disorder. Encourage increased dietary salt (3–5 g daily) and fluid (up to 2.5 litres daily) in the absence of contraindications such as hypertension or heart failure.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)
- Recognizable premonitory symptoms may include progressive presyncope, diaphoresis, a sense of warmth, flushing, nausea, abdominal discomfort, visual blurring and vision loss. Teach the patient to use physical counterpressure maneuvers at the onset of presyncope.​[[9]](#c0035n00108)​[[10]](#DockxKAvauBDeBuckEEtAl.PhysicalMano-269B1462) These include squatting, crossing the legs with isometric contraction if standing, and vigorous hand clenching with upper girdle isometric contraction. All should be tried in patients <40 years of age.​[[11]](#TomainoMRomeoCVitaleEEtAl.PhysicalC-269B1713)
- Pacemaker therapy remains controversial in patients with vasovagal syncope. The evidence for closed loop stimulation (CLS) dual chamber pacing is quite strong.​[[12]](#Baron-EsquiviasGMorilloCAMoya-Mitja-269B1A5D)​[[13]](#c0035n00109)​[[14]](#c0035n00110) Pacing does remain contentious because of the earlier ISSUE studies, which reported that dual chamber pacing reduces syncope recurrences but only in patients with a negative tilt test.​[[15]](#c0035n00133) Due to lifetime complication rates and the usual remission of vasovagal syncope, it should be used only in older patients. These patients should be assessed at a tertiary referral clinic.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapy may be effective in some, although the evidence is mixed. Drugs that may be considered are shown in [Table 2](#c0035n00023). See the patient at least yearly to attempt to stop the drugs. Drug therapy may be unnecessary in patients with infrequent vasovagal syncope who have recognizable premonitory symptoms.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B)

Fludrocortisone can be tried if simple salt supplements are ineffective. The goal is fluid retention, which may precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients. A single randomized trial in children was negative.​[[16]](#c0035n00111) In adults, a trial of fludrocortisone reduced the likelihood of syncope by 50% in a subgroup of patients who had taken the drug for at least 2 weeks.​​[[17]](#SheldonRRajSRRoseSEtAl.Fludrocortis-3E73E5B3)

Alpha-agonists increase venous return, and thereby may prevent the onset of vasovagal syncope. Midodrine should be considered. It reduced the proportion of patients with syncope by a statistically significant 31% with a number needed to treat of 5.3 in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.​[[18]](#c0035n00036) This improvement was numerically nearly identical to, and is supported by, a similar but underpowered earlier study.​[[19]](#c0035n00134) Supine hypertension and urinary retention in older patients may complicate treatment.

**SSRIs** are not usually used for preventing vasovagal syncope. Paroxetine significantly reduced the frequency of spontaneous syncope over 2 years compared with placebo in a randomized trial,​[[20]](#c0035n00040) although fluoxetine was not demonstrated to be helpful in another trial.​[[21]](#c0035n00041)

**Beta-blockers** are not indicated as treatment for vasovagal syncope.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)

### Orthostatic Hypotension

### Introduction

Orthostatic hypotension is a drop in systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg when assuming an upright posture.​[[1]](#BrignoleMMoyaADeLangeFJEtAl.2018ESC-26994F53)​[[2]](#ShenWKSheldonRSBendittDGEtAl.2017AC-E23BD076)​[[3]](#SheldonRSGrubbBPOlshanskyBEtAl.2015-E23B341B) The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion while avoiding treatment side effects. Orthostatic hypotension is often associated with supine hypertension, which complicates its therapy.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Remove as many hypotensive and volume-depleting drugs as possible. Increase dietary salt and fluid intake if not contraindicated.
- Suggest patients elevate the head of the bed on blocks or bricks by 15–30 cm (this is often not well tolerated).
- Instruct patients to avoid hemodynamic stress such as getting up quickly, eating large meals, being in warm environments or hot baths, and activities involving heavy exertion.

### Pharmacologic Choices

Promoting sodium and water retention using specific drugs may be beneficial in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Fludrocortisone increases blood volume and sensitizes peripheral alpha receptors, so it is recommended despite the lack of randomized trials (see [Table 2](#c0035n00023)).

Midodrine (see [Table 2](#c0035n00023)) is a pressor amine that causes both venoconstriction (thereby increasing venous return) and arteriolar constriction (which directly increases blood pressure). Evidence supporting its use is limited, but midodrine can be used to significantly increase standing blood pressure and decrease symptoms.​[[22]](#IzcovichAGonzxe1lezMallaCManzottiME-3E748D5D) Timing of doses can be adjusted to match patient symptoms. Supine hypertension and other unwanted effects such as shivering may complicate treatment.

The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine, given alone or in combination with midodrine, significantly improved standing blood pressure without increasing supine blood pressure in a short-term randomized placebo-controlled trial.​[[23]](#c0035n00116) Further study is needed before this agent can be recommended.

Nonselective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol, nadolol) block vasodilatory beta2-receptors and reduce or abolish the fall in blood pressure upon standing in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Results of a small trial suggests they may be helpful if indicated for another reason and if tolerated.​[[24]](#c0035n00120)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Start treatment with lifestyle and dietary changes. Teach everyone physical maneuvers.
- Use drug therapy only if necessary; fludrocortisone if patient is healthy and normotensive and beta-blocker if >40 years of age. Use midodrine if fludrocortisone fails.
- All physicians treating patients with syncope should be familiar with relevant provincial driving regulations. The regulations vary with the cause of syncope and with the therapy. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society has guidelines on the fitness of patients with syncope to drive.​[[25]](#c0035n00121)
