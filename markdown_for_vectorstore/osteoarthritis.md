### Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder worldwide.​[[1]](#c0059n00021)​[[2]](#c0059n00413)​[[3]](#c0059n00345)​[[4]](#c0059n00346) It can impact any joint, but typically occurs in the spine (cervical or lumbar spine facet joints), hands, hips or knees. Hip and knee OA are ranked as the eleventh-highest contributors to global disability.​[[5]](#c0059n00527)

Primary OA is idiopathic and is often seen in the elderly. Secondary OA is generally the result of an “insult” to the joint, e.g., trauma, post-trauma joint malalignment or joint infection. Other causes of secondary OA include rheumatoid arthritis, gout, congenital joint abnormalities and hematologic genetic disorders (leukemia). Osteoarthritis is often incorrectly referred to as a degenerative disorder, but is actually a condition with definite biochemical and inflammatory changes within the cartilage matrix, the joint cavity, the joint capsule and support structures.​[[7]](#c0059n00488)​[[8]](#c0059n00489) Patients with OA suffer mostly from pain, stiffness, discomfort and joint function impairment. A systematic review found that pain and loss of function in OA often remained stable over time; however, low education level, high BMI and high number of comorbidities were more commonly associated with worsening of symptoms.​[[9]](#Wieczorek2019)

### Goals of Therapy

- Alleviate or eliminate joint pain
- Improve or restore joint function and mobility
- Improve muscle strength to protect cartilage, ligaments and the joint capsule
- Prevent and reduce damage to joint cartilage and supporting structures

All of the above goals may be achievable with appropriate early intervention.

### Investigations

Osteoarthritis is most commonly identified by joint signs and symptoms and confirmed by diagnostic imaging, if necessary.

- History:

  - joint stiffness usually lasting <30 minutes, with joint pain and/or dysfunction on certain movements
  - absence of signs or symptoms of other types of inflammatory arthritis
  - prior joint insults such as a history of trauma; joint infection or other inflammatory arthropathy; or genetic, biochemical or metabolic disease
- Physical examination:​[[10]](#c0059n00022)

  - pain, stiffness and limitation of both passive and active movement of joint (primary OA is most frequently seen in the hands at the proximal and distal interphalangeal finger joints or the thumb base metacarpal-trapezio-scaphoid joints; in the cervical spine and lower lumbar facet joints; or in the hips, knees or great toe joints)
  - deformity, muscle atrophy, ligament tenderness in 1 or more of the affected joints
  - ligament and capsular laxity and muscle atrophy resulting in joint instability and, in the later stages, joint deformity
  - joint effusions, audible or palpable crepitus with active flexion and extension.
- Imaging:

  - x-rays and diagnostic ultrasound may be of initial value to establish the presence and extent of joint structure damage. For lower extremity x-rays it is important to request weight bearing views and patella femoral flexed knee views. There is a discrepancy between the extent of imaging signs and the symptoms experienced by individuals suffering from OA: significant structural damage may not be accompanied with severe symptoms, or minimal structural change can be associated with severe pain. Joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral cysts (geodes) and bony sclerosis are the recognized radiological features of OA. Chondrocalcinosis (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate [CPPD] deposition) may be seen in the joint cartilage areas of patients with some metabolic disorders that predispose to secondary OA
  - MRI has lower sensitivity than other more cost-effective radiographic diagnosis tools in detecting OA.​[[11]](#c0059n00023) It may be useful when considering an associated soft tissue pathology and when considering a rare differential diagnosis. CT scan can be used if MRI is contraindicated
- Laboratory tests:

  - consider blood work for inflammatory markers (e.g., anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibody, CBC, rheumatoid factor, ESR, CRP) if other inflammatory arthritides are suspected
  - joint fluid analyses are valuable primarily to exclude infection in the presence of a joint effusion, to exclude gout and, less commonly, to identify CPPD as a causative or contributory factor

### Therapeutic Choices

A treatment algorithm for OA is presented in [Figure 1](#c0059n00003).

See [Suggested Readings](#c0059n00329) for OA treatment guidelines, although guidelines should not replace clinical judgment.

### Risk Factors and Prevention

Strategies for prevention or delay of disease involve advice on general health, exercise and nutrition, weight management, and avoidance of repeated trauma to a potentially affected joint.

Knee malalignment valgus (knock knee) and knee varus (outward knee bending) are recognized as independent risk factors for development of knee OA.​[[12]](#c0059n00279)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic options are important in the management of OA and in improving quality of life. Multidisciplinary-care teams including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists, family members and caregivers play an important role in the treatment of a patient with OA. Patient education is also vital in that it leads to improved pain management.​[[13]](#c0059n00280) Advise patients of online courses and educational sessions offered by the [Arthritis Society](https://www.arthritis.ca/support-education). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be considered in patients with OA.​[[14]](#ACR2019)

### Weight Loss

- Obesity is the most important modifiable risk factor for knee OA.​[[15]](#refitem-1212146-ABB240F6)​[[16]](#refitem-1212147-ABB27D1F) The damage to cartilage is related to both mechanical problems as well as metabolic factors related to abnormal lipid metabolism.​[[17]](#refitem-1162118-67032689)
- Studies suggest that OA patients with obesity or excess weight may significantly benefit from weight loss and that greater weight loss for a longer period of time has the best clinical outcome in terms of pain and function.​[[18]](#Atukorala2016)​[[19]](#c0059n00285)​[[20]](#Messier2018)​[[21]](#Bartholdy2019) This effect is observed even though weight loss may not be associated with increased physical activity.​[[21]](#Bartholdy2019)
- For more information on weight management, see Obesity.

### Exercise and Physiotherapy

Introduction of exercise at home or structured exercise under the guidance of a health-care practitioner is a key initial management strategy in OA.​[[22]](#c0059n00283)​[[23]](#Rausch2018)

- Health-care providers should give encouragement and advice about the availability and overall value of exercise in controlling symptoms, as misinformed patients tend to avoid physical activity for fear of causing harm.​[[24]](#Hurley2018)
- Patient participation in exercise programs may slightly improve physical function, depression, pain, self-efficacy and social function in knee and hip OA.​[[24]](#Hurley2018)​[[25]](#BrosseauLWellsGAPughAGEtAl.OttawaPa-ABADC672) Exercise programs were also shown to reduce the need for total hip replacement by 44% in patients with hip OA,​[[26]](#refitem-1212136-ABAE5233) and reduce pain and improve physical function in hand OA.​[[27]](#c0059n00530)​[[28]](#Brosseau2018) The benefit can be sustained in some patients for 2–6 months after stopping the exercise regimen.​[[29]](#refitem-09032017-1)​[[30]](#refiitem-09032017-2) More research is needed to determine the specific program components with strongest effect. Optimal exercise programs should have 1 aim and focus, such as improving aerobic capacity.​[[31]](#c0059n00352)
- Both at home and clinic-based exercise programs are shown to have beneficial effects and are superior to education alone.​[[32]](#Dell2019) Any recommendation for physical activity should therefore take into account the patient’s preference, as well as availability of resources and local facilities.
- Both resistance exercises and land-based aerobic activities of different intensities were shown to effectively reduce pain and improve function in knee OA.​[[22]](#c0059n00283) Neuromuscular exercise programs (targeting sensorimotor control and functional stability) were also shown to be effective in improving function and quality of life, and may be associated with pain reduction in hip and knee OA.​[[33]](#CADTH2018)
- Limited data suggest that optimal exercise programs consist of 12 sessions, divided into 2–3 sessions per week.​[[31]](#c0059n00352)
- Evidence is strongest for land-based exercise programs; however, aquatic exercise may also provide short-term benefits for hip and knee OA pain. The benefits of swimming can be similar to cycling exercises.​[[34]](#refitem-1212141-ABB07BDC)​[[35]](#refitem-1212142-ABB0D9D4)​[[36]](#refitem-1212143-ABB10D62)
- Yoga and tai chi may reduce pain and stiffness and improve physical function and quality of life for patients with OA.​[[37]](#c0059n00512)​[[38]](#c0059n00284)​[[39]](#refitem-1212139-ABAF0A0E)

Some patients may benefit from transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS); however, the effectiveness of TENS has not been established.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[40]](#c0059n00348)​[[41]](#OARSI2019) Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has been found to have some beneficial effect on pain relief and physical function; however, more studies are required to determine the appropriate frequency and dosage of ESWT.​[[42]](#Wang2019)

### Orthotics and Aids to Daily Living

- Shoe orthotics that support the long and transverse arch of the foot may be of value in patients with flat arches and those with associated midfoot or ankle pronation or supination.​[[43]](#c0059n00025) Orthotics may also be helpful in the management or prevention of great toe joint and midfoot OA.​[[44]](#refitem-1202143-D33790E3) Some patients with OA of the knee may derive some pain relief with orthotics, but a sustained benefit has not been demonstrated.​[[45]](#refitem-1212122-AB21D0B6)​[[46]](#refitem-1212124-AB95F57A)​[[47]](#Geenen2018)
- Elastic supports, taping and compression sleeves may be beneficial to patients with elbow, knee or ankle OA pain and instability; however, the quality of evidence to support the use of such modalities is low.​[[47]](#Geenen2018)
- Braces may be beneficial for patients awaiting surgery or for poor surgical candidates, but they are expensive and not well tolerated.​[[44]](#refitem-1202143-D33790E3)​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[48]](#c0059n00491)

  The use of a brace for knee OA results in a small to moderate reduction in pain but it is not of benefit in all patients.​[[45]](#refitem-1212122-AB21D0B6)​[[49]](#refitem-1212126-AB97E17C)
- Splints can improve hand pain and function.​[[47]](#Geenen2018) Devices such as canes and walkers may be suggested for those with hip and knee OA.​[[14]](#ACR2019)

### Surgery

Arthroplasty is an option for patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee and hip with unremitting symptomatology despite adherence to conservative medical management. In the majority of patients, hip and knee arthroplasties result in improvement in both pain and functional status.​[[50]](#c0059n00501) Whether joint arthroplasty should be done early or late in the course of OA is heavily debated; however, quality of life must be a significant consideration in favour of early surgical intervention. Loss of function can lead to obesity, worsening OA, and the development or exacerbation of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.​[[51]](#refitem-12121100-ADA3CFB5) Possible complications include loosening of the prostheses (osteolysis) and postoperative infection.​[[52]](#c0059n00502)​[[53]](#c0059n00503)​[[54]](#c0059n00504) A common concern with early surgical intervention is the risk of revision surgery. However, a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports estimates that hip and total knee replacement surgeries could be expected to last for 25 years in 58% and 82% of patients respectively.​[[55]](#Evans2019a)​[[56]](#Evans2019b) The authors are in favour of early surgical intervention in the interest of improved quality of life.

Patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasties are at an elevated risk of DVT, and postoperative prophylaxis with pharmacologic agents is recommended. See Venous Thromboembolism for pharmacologic options used for the prevention of DVT.

With the advent of 3D printing, a significant leap in customizing total hip and knee prostheses has developed. These customized components mirror the patients’ original biometric configuration and allow for the true patient joint curve to be reproduced. Customized joint replacement parts are produced from a CT scan of the joint and lower extremity, which is then used to form a true 3D copy of the knee, and from this, the cutting jigs and joint replacement components are shaped. The components give optimal coverage and bone contact due to their customized dimensions, thus making them potentially more stable and possibly giving them a longer in situ life span.​[[57]](#Trauner2018)​[[58]](#wong2016)

Osteotomy can reduce pain and improve knee function by reducing load in selected patients with medial joint line (compartment) knee OA.​[[59]](#refitem-12121104-ADA948C1)

Athroscopic joint lavage and joint débridement are of questionable value.​[[60]](#c0059n00505)

### Pharmacologic Choices

Standard pharmacological OA management involves a stepwise approach consisting of initial use of topical analgesics, followed by oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and injectable agents. Notwithstanding the side effect profile of anti-inflammatory agents, a detailed review of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis supports the concept that oral and injectable anti-inflammatory agents are the most important pharmaceutical agents in the management of osteoarthritis pain and function.​[[61]](#refitem-1212149-ADAB5B44)

### Topical Analgesics

Topical analgesics are a treatment option for hand or knee OA, with the potential for a reduced risk of side effects compared to oral therapy.​[[62]](#c0059n00492) Topical NSAIDs may be especially useful in at-risk groups including the elderly, who are at an increased risk of GI, renal, cardiovascular and other NSAID adverse effects.

Topical diclofenac has comparable efficacy to oral NSAIDs for relief of hand and knee pain due to osteoarthritis when used for a 6–12 week duration in 10–20% of people.​[[65]](#refitem-1162161-EB87C9B2) The local administration and reduced plasma concentrations (<5%) result in a lower incidence of GI bleeds and infrequent serious adverse events compared to oral NSAIDs. If NSAID therapy is desired, begin with topical rather than oral agents in persons ≥75 years of age.​[[14]](#ACR2019) Monitor for serious adverse effects that may occur in the elderly, including GI upset.​[[66]](#c0059n00289) Counsel patients on common side effects including dry skin and local application site reactions.

Other topical analgesics (see [Table 3](#c0059n00262)) can be used adjunctively with oral therapy for knee OA, but evidence supporting their use is limited. They may be offered to those refusing systemic therapy. Capsaicin has been shown to be superior to placebo for pain control in knee OA in 2 small studies, but patients were permitted to use oral analgesics.​[[67]](#c0059n00414)​[[68]](#c0059n00454) The burning sensation caused by capsicum derivatives is often not well tolerated. Capsaicin has not been studied for hand OA and should be avoided to prevent contamination of the eye.​[[14]](#ACR2019) Preliminary studies indicate that arnica gel may be comparable to topical ibuprofen for relief of OA pain, but further confirmatory studies are required.​[[69]](#c0059n00321) If patients experience pain, swelling or burning from topical analgesics, advise them to stop using the product and seek immediate medical attention.​[[70]](#c0059n00507)

### Simple Analgesics

Acetaminophen has a relatively low risk of side effects and has been shown in some studies to be moderately effective for the treatment of OA. It is recommended, therefore, as the oral drug of first choice in the management of OA.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[71]](#c0059n00033) However, recent meta-analyses show that acetaminophen provides minimal pain relief in the treatment of OA.​[[72]](#c0059n00537)​[[73]](#daCostaBR1)​[[74]](#refitem-1212147-3743DC4E) Additionally, there are increasing safety concerns with high doses of acetaminophen.​[[75]](#refitem-1212147-37AA0E5F) Consider the following when prescribing acetaminophen for OA:

- Most studies of acetaminophen in OA used the *maximum daily dose of 1 g QID* for a short period (median 6 weeks).
- Maximum therapeutic dose should be tried for 1–2 weeks to assess efficacy.
- Patients taking acetaminophen *must* be counselled not to exceed the recommended daily dose and be informed of nonprescription and prescription products that contain acetaminophen.
- Total daily intake of acetaminophen should be monitored, especially in patients taking opioid-containing combination products.​[[77]](#c0059n00039)
- The existence of liver disease does not preclude the use of acetaminophen; careful monitoring of liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) is recommended to guide treatment decisions in this situation.
- The maximum daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 g; the American Liver Foundation recommends a maximum of 3 g of acetaminophen daily.
- In frail elderly patients or elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency or a history of alcohol abuse, the American Geriatrics Society suggests a daily dose of 2–3 g.
- Risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity from therapeutic doses of acetaminophen include malnourishment, acute nutritional deficiency (fasting) and being underweight (<50 kg).​[[76]](#refitem-1172164-BD276ED4)

### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

NSAIDs are more effective analgesics than acetaminophen, but have a greater risk of adverse effects (see [Table 1](#AEofNSAID)).​[[73]](#daCostaBR1)​[[78]](#c0059n00506) Consider topical NSAIDs before initiating oral NSAID therapy, particularly in the elderly (see [Topical Analgesics](#c0059n00016)). If topical NSAIDs and acetaminophen are not sufficient, initiating low-dose NSAID therapy may be of benefit. NSAID dosage can be adjusted upwards to control pain, but precautions must be taken to minimize adverse effects. The patient’s CV, renal and GI risk profile should be carefully considered when choosing an NSAID. For more information regarding NSAID dosing, see [Table 2](#c0059n00250).

**Table 1:** Risks Associated with Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Use

|  | Evidence | Risk Management |
| Cardiovascular risks: Atrial fibrillation or flutter Congestive heart failure Edema Hypertension Myocardial infarction Stroke | Edema and hypertension are the most commonly reported CV adverse effects.​ [79] All NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of MI.​ [80] ​ [81] ​ [82] Risk is highest with higher daily doses (i.e., celecoxib >200 mg, diclofenac >100 mg, ibuprofen >1200 mg and naproxen >750 mg). Absolute risk is higher in high CV risk patients.​ [82] NSAID use is also associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation,​ [83] ​ [84] heart failure,​ [85] ​ [86] ​ [87] VTE​ [88] and ischemic stroke.​ [89] CV risk increases with COX-2 selectivity (among nonselective NSAIDs, diclofenac may carry higher risk), increased dose, recent or current use, or pre-existing CV disease.​ [80] ​ [82] ​ [83] ​ [84] ​ [85] ​ [86] ​ [89] Compared with other NSAIDs, low-dose naproxen may carry less risk of cardiovascular disease.​ [81] | All NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with high CV risk or with pre-existing severe CV disease​ [a] (e.g., severe heart failure). COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac and high-dose ibuprofen should be avoided in patients with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease. Use low-dose naproxen or ibuprofen for short duration in patients with low to moderate risk factors for CV disease. Advise patients and caregivers to observe any CV issues and to record and report any hypertension, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, speech impairment, visual impairment or limb weakness. For patients with hypertension taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, consider the addition or dose increase of an antihypertensive agent of a different class.​ [90] |
| Gastrointestinal toxicity: Dyspepsia Gastroduodenal ulcers GI bleeding and perforation | Mild and transient nausea, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea and dyspepsia are the most commonly reported GI adverse effects.​ [79] All patients may be at risk of GI adverse effects; however, risk is higher with:​ [91] Age ≥65 Comorbid medical conditions Multiple NSAID use (including low-dose ASA) High doses of NSAIDs History of upper GI bleeding Presence of H. pylori infection Concomitant intake of antiplatelets, anticoagulants, SSRIs, SNRIs or corticosteroids Risk of GI adverse effects may continue even after cessation of NSAID therapy. All NSAIDs confer an increased risk of GI damage;​ [92] however, COX-2 inhibitors appear to be associated with a lower risk.​ [93] ​ [94] Among the nonselective NSAIDs, evidence suggests that naproxen has a higher risk of GI adverse effects.​ [78] | Topical NSAIDs (for knee and hand OA) and acetaminophen may be safer first-line options in patients at risk of GI adverse effects. Use low-dose NSAIDs for short durations. Consider testing for H. pylori infection before initiating NSAID therapy. Offer those who test positive an eradication therapy.​ [95] In patients at moderate risk of GI adverse effects, use a PPI with a nonselective NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor.​ [93] ​ [96] For patients at high risk of GI adverse effects, combination of selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI offers the best GI protection​ [97] ​ [98] (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease ). Misoprostol 200 mcg QID is effective in preventing NSAID-induced GI complications; however, it is not well tolerated. Advise patients to observe GI issues daily, and to record and report any dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, or signs of blood per rectum or with vomiting. |
| Nephrotoxicity: Acute kidney injury Chronic kidney injury Edema Renal insufficiency | Edema and hypertension are the most commonly reported renal adverse effects.​ [79] All NSAIDs are associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury.​ [99] ​ [100] Prolonged use of NSAIDs may increase risk of rapid CKD progression.​ [101] Concomitant intake of ACE inhibitors, diuretics or ARBs increases risk of acute kidney injury.​ [102] | Topical NSAIDs (for knee and hand OA) and acetaminophen may be safer first-line options, especially in the elderly. Avoid NSAIDs in patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr <30 mL/min). Monitor BP regularly (daily, weekly or monthly depending on the initial degree of patient risk). |

### Antidepressants

Duloxetine, an SNRI, demonstrated significantly greater improvement in OA knee pain compared with placebo.​[[103]](#c0059n00041) Adverse effects leading to discontinuation of the drug included nausea and asthenia.

Although SNRIs exhibit antiplatelet properties, the combination of duloxetine and NSAIDs does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding-related events compared with an NSAID used alone.​[[104]](#c0059n00374) Of note, SNRIs have been added to the 2019 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list of drugs to avoid in patients with a history of falls or fractures.​[[105]](#Beers2019)

Consider duloxetine if a patient with OA presents with concomitant depression and/or neuropathic pain or widespread pain.​[[41]](#OARSI2019)

### Opioids

Tramadol may offer relief of moderate to severe pain in OA,​[[106]](#c0059n00029) though a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that the magnitude of benefit is likely very small.​[[107]](#CochraneTramadol2019) It has a less serious side effect potential than other opioids;​[[107]](#CochraneTramadol2019) however, there are increasing safety concerns with the use of tramadol, including risk of dependence similar to that of non-tramadol opioids.​[[108]](#Thiels2019)​[[109]](#Zeng2019) Tramadol may be considered in patients who have not responded to other therapies.​[[14]](#ACR2019) It can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs. Both immediate-release and prolonged-release tramadol exhibit pharmacokinetic properties in the elderly similar to those in younger patients;​[[110]](#c0059n00294) however, the elderly are recommended to be started on a lower initiating dose with dosage adjustments occurring for patients with severely impaired kidney function.

The use of non-tramadol opioids in OA has no long-term value.​[[111]](#Krebs2018)​[[112]](#daCosta2014) In addition, the side effect profile (constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, secondary dangers of falls and fractures) and potential for misuse preclude opioids as a choice in OA management,​[[113]](#Fuggle2019) except possibly as a last resort in patients who have exhausted all other treatment options or who have contraindications to NSAIDs.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[114]](#refitem-1212177-ADB3D447)

Any prescription of opioids should be according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines for opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain and should likely not precede treatment with anti-inflammatories or other atypical pain relievers.​[[114]](#refitem-1212177-ADB3D447)

### Glucosamine and Chondroitin

Endogenous glucosamine and chondroitin maintain the integrity of cartilage within a joint. The evidence on the efficacy of exogenous glucosamine and chondroitin is conflicting. Although some trials, at high risk of bias and of low-quality (e.g., lack of placebo comparator, small size), have shown moderate efficacy in reducing pain, stiffness and functional limitations, other studies as well as several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate efficacy.​[[115]](#c0059n00036)​[[116]](#c0059n00037) Accordingly, treatment guidelines do not recommend these supplements for the treatment of OA.​[[14]](#ACR2019)

Despite the lack of evidence from trials, patients often report improvement after using products containing glucosamine and/or chondroitin. Those who are interested in taking these supplements can be advised that glucosamine sulfate may be superior to glucosamine hydrochloride, and that the best available evidence is for the use of chondroitin sulfate for hand OA.​[[14]](#ACR2019) Both glucosamine and chondroitin have good safety profiles.​[[117]](#c0059n00038)​[[118]](#refitem-1212194-AE254756)

### Oral Corticosteroids

While preliminary studies have examined the use of oral corticosteroids for relief of acute OA pain,​[[119]](#c0059n00358)​[[120]](#Kroon2019) they are associated with significant side effects including loss of bone density and development of osteoporosis,​[[121]](#c0059n00042) and may also increase the risk of joint osteonecrosis. Accordingly, oral corticosteroid use is not recommended for chronic OA pain.

### Injectable Therapy

If nonpharmacologic, topical and oral options have been exhausted, injectable therapy may be considered.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[41]](#OARSI2019) See [Table 4](#c0059n00263) for injectable treatment options.

Although guidelines support the use of intra-articular corticosteroids,​[[14]](#ACR2019) evidence regarding their efficacy is conflicting and their place in OA therapy is thus controversial. Some trials, mostly of low methodological quality, have shown benefit in reducing pain and inflammation for up to 6 weeks post-injection.​[[122]](#refitem-1212190-AD9A1ED9) The benefit may be greater in patients with more severe baseline pain;​[[123]](#vanMiddelkoop2016) in some cases, based on author experience, the effects may last for 3–6 months.​[[124]](#refitem-11621116-6703D0C4) Other studies, of higher quality, did not find any benefits.​[[122]](#refitem-1212190-AD9A1ED9)​[[125]](#McAlindon2017) Data on the safety of intra-articular corticosteroids are also conflicting. While a 2015 Cochrane review did not find evidence of harm in the short term (<6 months),​[[122]](#refitem-1212190-AD9A1ED9) case-series and cohort studies indicate a possible worsening of pain and function, narrowing of joint space as well as joint deterioration.​[[126]](#ZengC2019)​[[127]](#Kompel2019) When considering intra-articular corticosteroids, the short-term benefits should be weighed against the possible long-term risks for every individual patient. Intra-articular corticosteroids may therefore be a suitable choice for patients who continue to have pain despite optimized nonpharmacological therapy (i.e., weight loss and exercise therapy) for whom NSAID therapy is contraindicated or provides inadequate relief, who are poor candidates for joint replacement surgery (e.g., frail elderly), or who are looking for short-term occasional pain relief. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids should not be administered more than 3–4 times per year in weight-bearing joints. An excessive number of injections increases the likelihood of producing a Charcot-type arthropathy, a condition marked by neuropathy and progressive bone resorption and deformity.​[[128]](#Steinber1967)

Outcomes of individual studies of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee OA vary significantly due to differences in products and study designs.​[[129]](#c0059n00498) Systematic reviews suggest a small effect on pain and function.​[[129]](#c0059n00498)​[[130]](#c0059n00288)​[[131]](#c0059n00317) However, a network meta-analysis comparing different pharmacologic therapies for knee OA suggests that intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections are superior to oral NSAIDs and intra-articular corticosteroids in reducing pain and stiffness.​[[72]](#c0059n00537) Additionally, the duration of benefit of hyaluronic acid injections may be longer than that of corticosteroid injections. It is reasonable to consider intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee OA in patients who have failed full-dose acetaminophen therapy and are ≥75 years of age or at high risk of NSAID adverse effects.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[41]](#OARSI2019)

The combination of intra-articular corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid may benefit some patients. A double-blind study has shown that intra-articular knee injections of hyaluronic acid/​triamcinolone hexacetonide are superior to saline at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postinjection and better than hyaluronic acid alone at 1 and 3 weeks postinjection; however, similar benefit was noted at 6–26 weeks postinjection for both the combination and hyaluronic acid alone treatment groups.​[[132]](#refitem-11621122-6704CBCB)

Some studies have shown that platelet-rich plasma **(PRP)** injections improve function for up to 12 months from baseline in patients with knee OA and tend to be more effective than hyaluronic acid injections.​[[133]](#refitem-1212192-AD98AB9A)​[[134]](#refitem-1212195-AD964E84) Multiple injections result in improvement after 6 months of therapy. Patients with mild to moderate OA with less degeneration tend to respond better to PRP injections;​[[135]](#c0059n00499)​[[136]](#c0059n00500) however, the quality of evidence remains low and PRP injections are not recommended.​[[14]](#ACR2019)​[[41]](#OARSI2019)

### Therapeutic Tips

- Patients should receive only 1 NSAID at a time (with the exception of low-dose cardioprotective ASA). However, the advantages of COX-2 inhibitors (lower GI toxicity compared to nonselective NSAIDs) are negated when they are taken with low-dose ASA.
- Dyspepsia with NSAIDs does not correlate with endoscopically proven ulcers or with serious upper GI complications. Patients treated with NSAIDs who complain of dyspepsia in the absence of risk factors (see [Table 1](#AEofNSAID)) can be switched to simple analgesics or offered a trial with a different class of NSAID, or the dyspepsia may be treated symptomatically (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease).
- Making patients aware of the GI risks of NSAIDs has been shown to lower the incidence of acute GI bleeding.​[[137]](#c0059n00515)
- For most patients, the use of nonpharmacologic measures combined with a flexible regimen of simple analgesics supplemented by anti-inflammatory medications provides adequate relief of symptoms and functional benefit. As many OA sufferers are elderly, start with low doses, increasing slowly to therapeutic effect. Drug interactions from polypharmacy are also a concern in older patients.
- Patients presenting with unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation MI (UA/NSTEMI) should discontinue use of nonselective NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors (except ASA) because of the increased CV risk associated with these agents;​[[138]](#c0059n00516) alternative methods for pain control are suggested.
