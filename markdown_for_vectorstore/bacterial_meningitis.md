### Introduction

Meningitis is an inflammation of the cranial and spinal leptomeninges. Anatomically, the meninges consist of 3 outer coverings of the brain and spinal cord: the dura, the arachnoid and the pia mater. The dura is tightly adherent to the cranial periosteum. The middle layer is the arachnoid and loosely covers the brain and spinal cord. The third layer is the pia mater, which is continuous with the surface of the brain and spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid is in the subarachnoid space, enclosed between the arachnoid and the pia (see [Figure 1](#CNSAnatomy)). For review articles on bacterial meningitis in particular patient populations, see [Suggested Readings](#c0095n00139).​[[1]](#LeSauxNCanadianPaediatricSocietyInf-6371CB9C)​[[2]](#McGillFHeydermanRSPanagiotouSTunkel-6310E96F)​[[3]](#vandeBeek)​[[4]](#VanEttekoven2017)​[[5]](#Wall2021)

This chapter focuses on common bacterial infections causing meningitis and does not include infections such as ventriculitis, encephalitis and brain abscesses, nor meningitis due to other causes such as viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, parasites and fungi. It does not cover the management of meningitis associated with ventricular shunts. Noninfectious causes of meningitis, such as drug-induced and carcinomatous meningitis, are also not discussed.

The most common pathogens that cause bacterial meningitis are the same pathogens that colonize the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract; they include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. During or after a respiratory viral illness, colonization rates in the nasopharynx will be up to 40%, especially in young children. The bacteria have specific fimbriae or pili that adhere to the surface of the epithelial cells of the mucosa. It is believed that a virus upregulates receptors, thereby causing increased bacterial adherence.​[[6]](#SkevakiCLTsialtaPTrochoutsouAILogot-6310EC0F) For Listeria and group B streptococcus, the source is the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract.

After colonization of the mucosa, the bacteria invade the bloodstream due to a break in the mucosal barrier. It is believed that this occurs with bacteria either passing through or between epithelial cells.​[[7]](#CoureuilMBourdoulousSMarulloSNassif-63110EE9) The presence of viable bacteria in the bloodstream allows them to invade the blood-brain barrier, likely through the choroid plexus. Experimental studies have indicated that there is a relationship between higher levels of bacteria in the blood and subsequent development of meningitis.​[[8]](#KimKS.PathogenesisOfBacterialMening-63118148) Though most cases of meningitis are believed to occur during periods of bacteremia, there may be direct spread of bacteria (especially with *S. pneumoniae*) from pre-existing otitis media or sinusitis and, more rarely, from defects in the base of the skull such as the cribriform plate near the ethmoid sinus.

Once bacteria are present inside the subarachnoid space of the brain or spinal cord, there is little host defense; bacterial multiplication occurs, leading to the release of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines. Paradoxically, the release of cytokines can increase the influx of granulocytes, causing more inflammation. This can be augmented by bacterial lysis and further release of inflammatory agents leading to clinical symptoms of meningitis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) are among the key mediators of inflammation. The combination of inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress is believed to cause neuronal injury resulting in long-term sequelae in the central nervous system and hearing loss.​[[2]](#McGillFHeydermanRSPanagiotouSTunkel-6310E96F)​[[9]](#BarichelloTGenerosoJSSimxf5esLRElia-6311B943)

**Epidemiology**

The incidence of meningitis has dramatically decreased since the use of conjugated vaccines against H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis A, C, W and Y.​[[10]](#OkikeIORibeiroSRamsayMEHeathPTSharl-6311E7E4)​[[11]](#BijlsmaMWBrouwerMCKasanmoentalibESK-6312330D)​[[12]](#MartinNGSadaranganiMPollardAJEtAl.H-6312B218)​[[13]](#FletcherMABalmerPBonnetEEtAl.PCVsIn-636E3D29)​[[14]](#DauglaDMGamiJPGamougamKEtAl.EffectO-636E88C9) Most of the reduction in disease has been in children younger than 5 years of age.​[[15]](#GBD2013MortalityAndCausesOfDeathCol-636EF614) An additional benefit of conjugate vaccines is a substantial amount of herd immunity, since these vaccines decrease nasopharyngeal carriage of the specific vaccine-associated bacteria. The herd immunity has contributed to some protection for unimmunized persons due to decreased transmission of vaccine-specific serotypes.​[[16]](#BijlsmaMWBrouwerMCSpanjaardLVanDeBe-636F98E7) In countries with robust immunization programs, the incidence of meningitis is lower compared to areas where routine immunization schedules do not include meningitis vaccines.​[[17]](#GBD)

[Table 1](#c0095n00014) lists common pathogens causing bacterial meningitis based on patient age and comorbidities. In both adults and children, the most common causes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis are S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae.​[[18]](#HasbunRWoottonSH-F94A8851) In areas where vaccination uptake is high, cases caused by H. influenzae type b have been almost eliminated. However, there has been a significant increase in non-b H. influenzae (especially type a) invasive disease, particularly among Indigenous populations of northern Canada and the Arctic as well as other countries.​[[19]](#Slack) It is unknown whether genetic or socioeconomic factors, such as crowded housing conditions and food insecurity, contribute to this increased risk. The only vaccine available for H. influenzae is for serotype b; vaccines for non-b serotypes are not currently available.​[[20]](#PlumbI-F94B1FC8)​[[21]](#ShuelM-F94B47ED)​[[22]](#TsangRSW-F94B88F1)

Other underlying factors that may increase the risk of meningitis are a cerebrospinal leak or recent neurosurgery. Hyposplenia or asplenia also increase the risk of bacterial meningitis due to encapsulated organisms such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis. The receipt of eculizumab is associated with a 10 000-fold higher risk of meningococcal disease (0.18 per 100 000 patients compared to the general population).​[[23]](#Benamu-21781456)

Other pathogens, including group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, are significant causes of meningitis in neonates, immunocompromised patients and older adults;​[[24]](#Gerner-SmidtPEthelbergSSchiellerupP-636FECE6) see [Table 1](#c0095n00014) for more information.

Although much progress has been made with vaccines, emerging issues such as lack of vaccine for H. influenzae type a (Hia) and access and coverage of vaccines against N. meningitidis serotype B continue to keep immunization at the forefront of the management and prevention of meningitis.

- There is still significant mortality and morbidity associated with bacterial meningitis.​[[1]](#LeSauxNCanadianPaediatricSocietyInf-6371CB9C)​[[25]](#SadaranganiMScheifeleDWHalperinSAEt-6407470B) Acute complications may include but are not limited to:

  - brain abscess
  - brain herniation
  - cerebritis or ventriculitis
  - CNS infarction resulting in hemiparesis, quadriparesis or spinal cord infarction
  - diabetes insipidus and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
  - seizure
  - shock and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
  - subdural effusion or empyema
  - venous sinus thrombosis
- Neurologic sequelae may include but are not limited to:

  - ataxia
  - behavioural difficulties
  - epilepsy
  - hydrocephalus
  - intellectual deficit
  - sensorineural hearing loss
  - visual problems including cortical blindness

### Goals of Therapy

- When a clinical diagnosis of meningitis is made, provide empiric antibiotic therapy with drugs that penetrate the central nervous system
- Modify therapy if required once a pathogen is identified
- Eradicate bacteria from the CNS
- Decrease morbidity and mortality
- Manage and minimize acute and chronic complications that can lead to permanent neurologic damage

### Investigations

If meningitis due to an infection is suspected clinically, assessment, investigation and management should occur promptly in an acute care or inpatient setting of a health-care facility with laboratory and imaging facilities. The clinical presentation will vary depending on age and the patient’s ability to localize symptoms and the stage of the infection. The decision to initiate investigations and treatment for meningitis remains a clinical one that is supported by laboratory parameters. Several clinical prediction models have been developed to help in the differentiation of bacterial meningitis from viral causes;​[[26]](#Brouwer)​[[27]](#Nigrovic-F94D48BF) however, some recent guidelines state that, while these models can assist in clinical management, clinical judgment is paramount in deciding on starting antibiotics,​[[28]](#ESCMID) while others recommend against their routine use.​[[29]](#UKJointSpec)

### History and Clinical Presentation

### Risk Factors

Assess for underlying risk factors associated with bacterial meningitis, even though there is often no specific risk factor identified aside from extremes of age (<12 months or >70 y of age):

- Patients with recent head or spinal trauma or surgery, CSF leaks, cochlear implants.​[[30]](#ChuV-F94CDBE7)
- Persons who are receiving (or who have received in the months prior to presentation) any immunosuppressive therapy, including long-term treatment with prednisone (≥2 mg/kg/day for >14 days), chemotherapy and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies including, but not limited to, eculizumab.
- Multiple myeloma, asplenia, sickle cell disease, leukemia.

### Clinical Presentation

- Most patients present within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.
- Children <2 years of age and patients who are nonverbal may present with only a change in temperature (fever *or* hypothermia) and may have nonspecific lethargy or altered level of consciousness. Other signs, especially in infants, are usually nonspecific and may include inconsolable crying (or altered quality of cry), irritability, lack of response to social stimulation, seizures, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, pallor and/or a bulging anterior fontanelle (late sign).
- Older children who are verbal and adults often have fever, headache, nuchal rigidity or back pain, and/or photophobia. In a study of adult patients with bacterial meningitis, 95% had 2 of the 4 following symptoms: headache, fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status.​[[31]](#vdBeek2004) Patients often report feeling systemically unwell with associated vomiting.
- Neurologic symptoms at any age may include loss of balance, disorientation, confusion or altered level of consciousness, and focal neurological deficits.
- Patients of any age may present in septic shock (e.g., decreased level of consciousness, low BP, poor peripheral perfusion) rather than with fever and headache.

### Physical Signs

- Vital signs frequently show tachycardia and tachypnea. Blood pressure may be normal or low, especially in patients presenting with septic shock.
- Signs of meningeal irritation, such as a stiff neck and Kernig and Brudzinski signs, are often absent in neonates and infants <1 year of age who have open fontanels, though present in older children and adults. Neurologic signs may include inability to walk, seizure, disorientation, confusion, altered level of consciousness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs, cranial nerve palsies and/or other signs of increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema.​[[32]](#ForgieSE.TheHistoryAndCurrentReleva-63703BF0) Because there are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms, and absence of these signs does not exclude meningitis, some scoring systems may have their advantages and disadvantages.​[[26]](#Brouwer) Signs of cerebral infarction such as a focal neurological defect may also be present; however, these usually present later in the clinical course and are more common with Herpes simplex meningoencephalitis.
- Other physical exam findings may include petechiae or purpura, which are suggestive of meningococcal meningitis but can also be seen with S. pneumoniae.
- In patients who are currently or have recently been on antimicrobials, the signs of meningitis may be attenuated or atypical.

### Laboratory Investigations

### Cerebrospinal Fluid

- Examination of the CSF is essential for making the diagnosis and is warranted whenever meningitis is suspected.
- A clinical prediction rule for identifying children who have CSF pleocytosis and are at low risk of bacterial meningitis has been published.​[[27]](#Nigrovic-F94D48BF)
- *Do not delay empiric antibacterial therapy* if a lumbar puncture (LP) cannot be performed at the time of presentation.​[[33]](#AprilM-FA554737) LP is contraindicated only in the presence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, shock or coagulopathy, and infection at the proposed site of the LP. The clinical features of increased ICP are focal neurologic signs, new onset seizures, altered or deteriorating consciousness, or papilledema on exam. If raised ICP is strongly suspected clinically, the LP should be deferred until after CT.
- In patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, CSF may also be obtained by tapping the shunt percutaneously, although strict sterile technique is mandatory and this procedure is usually reserved for neurosurgery.
- Examine the CSF for cell count and differential, culture and sensitivity, and glucose and protein concentrations. The typical CSF findings of patients with bacterial meningitis may be altered if the patient has been on antimicrobials prior to sampling of CSF. Findings consistent with bacterial meningitis usually include:

  - CSF that is turbid or cloudy with increased pressure above 20 cm H2O
  - elevated CSF WBC count (normally <5 WBC × 10​6/L, but in bacterial meningitis WBC is usually >100 × 10​6/L and often >1000 ×10​6/L) with a predominance of neutrophils; *initially* the CSF WBC count may be considerably less elevated; it is often not possible to differentiate bacterial from viral or other types of meningitis based purely on the CSF WBC
  - reduced CSF glucose (CSF-serum ratio <0.6 for infants ≤2 months of age; <0.4 for those >2 months of age)​[[34]](#StrausSEThorpeKEHolroyd-LeducJ.HowD-6623D944)
  - normal or elevated CSF protein (range varies according to age)
  - elevated CSF lactate level (>4 mmol/L) may be present in postoperative neurosurgical patients with bacterial meningitis​[[35]](#SakushimaKHayashinoYKawaguchiTEtAl.-63711320)
  - *Note:* CSF Gram stain is positive in 80–90% of hematogenously acquired meningitis, but this decreases if the patient was on antimicrobials prior to the LP.​[[36]](#BaronEJMillerJMWeinsteinMPEtAl.AGui-6370B742) It is important to note that antimicrobials should  *not* be withheld on the basis of a negative Gram stain, as the Gram stain may be negative in some cases of bacterial meningitis.
- Culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but may not be positive, particularly in patients previously treated with antibacterials. Molecular detection of pathogens (PCR) may be useful, especially if antibiotics were given prior to the LP.​[[37]](#Liesman)
- In the setting of negative Gram stain and culture with significant CSF pleocytosis, consult an infectious diseases specialist to determine the utility of PCR or other tests to determine a pathogen:

  - the use of expanded molecular assays for the detection of pathogen-associated meningitis is increasing in many hospitals; samples can be referred to provincial and national laboratories as needed. Consult a local laboratory on the methods available
  - in certain clinical situations, early disseminated Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi can present as a subacute meningitis; clinical correlation is mandatory (for more information, see Lyme Disease)
  - latex agglutination of the CSF in meningitis has poor sensitivity and specificity and is not currently used in most laboratories
- A repeat LP may be indicated in the following situations:

  - failure to improve clinically (repeat imaging is also indicated in this scenario)
  - cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis
  - meningitis caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli or other unusual pathogens

### Blood

- Blood cultures should be done promptly prior to antimicrobial therapy using weight-based volumes to diagnose concurrent bacteremia. Blood cultures should be done regardless of the availability of CSF.
- CBC and differential.
- Blood glucose level at or near the time of the LP, if possible, to compare the CSF and blood glucose levels. Total blood protein measurement can also be performed.

### Imaging

- Imaging studies (CT or MRI of the head) are not routinely required but are indicated to detect cerebral herniation syndromes; therefore, it would be indicated for those individuals with focal neurologic signs, clinical evidence of brain herniation, decreased/fluctuating level of consciousness, clinical deterioration or persistent fever. In these situations, neuroimaging should be done prior to an LP.
- Imaging may delay CSF sampling initially. This may further delay initiation of therapeutic antimicrobials, which has been shown to negatively affect outcomes.​[[38]](#MichaelBMenezesBFCunniffeJEtAl.Effe-9259EE6C)​[[39]](#Glimxe5kerMJohanssonBGrindborgxd6Et-925A2E1A) If meningitis is highly suspected and focal signs of herniation are present, blood cultures should be taken and antimicrobials administered prior to an LP. If CSF sampling is deemed safe, it should be done as soon as possible.
- Neuroimaging is also indicated after start of therapy for patients who have decreased or fluctuating level of consciousness, clinical deterioration, persistent fever or poor response to empiric antimicrobial therapy.
- As patients >60 years of age and those with underlying neurologic or immunosuppressive conditions are at greater risk of Listeria, imaging is important as it may demonstrate cerebritis or other lesions typically associated with this pathogen and may be helpful in the diagnostic process.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Principles of Antibacterial Therapy

Antimicrobial therapy for meningitis should be timely. Early therapy is empiric, since the causative pathogen is usually not known at the time of presentation and therefore should broadly cover the most commonly encountered pathogens in the patient’s age group. Empiric therapy may be modified according to clinical judgment and patient characteristics.

[Table 1](#c0095n00014)​[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)​[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C) illustrates the most common potential organisms associated with specific risk factors (e.g., age, and specific host and environmental factors) and recommended empiric therapy.

- Antibiotic doses, adverse effects and drug interactions are shown in [Table 4](#c0095n00040).
- Initiate antimicrobial therapy without delay; each hour of delaying antibiotic administration has been shown to increase the risk of an unfavourable outcome (mortality or disability) by 30% in adults with bacterial meningitis.​[[42]](#Kxf8ster-RasmussenRKorshinAMeyerCN.-63712F6E)
- Treat for meningitis even if microorganisms are isolated from blood cultures only. CSF cultures can be negative even in the presence of meningitis.
- Empiric therapy:

  - Choice of empiric antibacterial therapy is based on the most likely causative organisms, host factors such as patient age and comorbidities (see [Table 1](#c0095n00014)),​[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)​[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C) and local antimicrobial resistance patterns.
  - When administering vancomycin in combination with a third-generation **cephalosporin**, give the cephalosporin followed 2 hours later by vancomycin. Giving the cephalosporin first ensures initial broad coverage and penetration into the CSF.
  - In patients <1 month of age, cefotaxime, ampicillin and gentamicin cover the most common pathogens (e.g., GBS, E. coli) if the CSF has initial pleocytosis without a positive Gram stain. If Gram stain has Gram positive cocci suggestive of GBS, cefotaxime may not be needed since the ampicillin will cover the GBS. If an infant <4 weeks of age has a Gram stain suggestive of pneumococcal meningitis, use cefotaxime and vancomycin, pending sensitivity results.​[[1]](#LeSauxNCanadianPaediatricSocietyInf-6371CB9C)
  - In all individuals >1 month of age with presumed meningitis, use ceftriaxone or cefotaxime followed ≥2 hours later by vancomycin as empiric therapy. This will provide coverage for penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae.
  - If patient is >60 years of age, is immunosuppressed, has prior or current malignancy, has alcohol use disorder, or has brainstem involvement on imaging, add ampicillin to provide coverage for Listeria (see [Table 1](#c0095n00014)).
  - If there is potential soil contamination from trauma, use ceftazidime (to cover for Pseudomonas) instead of ceftriaxone and add empiric amphotericin B for fungal coverage (i.e., Aspergillus).
  - If cultures are negative at 36–48 hours or the isolate is susceptible to penicillin or ceftriaxone/cefotaxime, vancomycin should be discontinued.
  - If the patient has a true history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the risks versus benefit of empiric treatment of suspected meningitis with appropriate antimicrobials should be discussed. The risk of cross-reaction between ceftriaxone and penicillin or amoxicillin is negligible since the side chains between penicillin and ceftriaxone are not similar. Precautions for anaphylaxis can be taken with the first dose of ceftriaxone.​[[43]](#Legacxe9-WiensPRubinsteinE.AdverseR-74147D81) Rapid penicillin desensitization due to a previous severe reaction may be an option, but this delays appropriate empiric therapy.
  - Due to the possibility of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and meningococci in Canada, penicillin G is no longer recommended as empiric therapy. A study conducted in Canada between 2011 and 2015 on isolates of S. pneumoniae found that, using meningeal breakpoints, susceptibility was about 90% for penicillin and 97% for ceftriaxone.​[[44]](#Karlowsky-1F6DE70B)
- Culture-directed therapy:

  - Re-evaluate and modify antibacterial therapy when results of the CSF Gram stain, culture and sensitivity become available (see [Table 2](#c0095n00020)).​[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)​[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C) A study involving infants and children determined that the median length of empiric therapy for over 97% of patients with *possible* meningitis was 3 days, suggesting that antibiotics could be discontinued earlier in patients in whom meningitis or other infection is not confirmed.​[[18]](#HasbunRWoottonSH-F94A8851)
  - Penicillin G can be used in patients with meningitis who have blood or CSF isolates of S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC of ≤0.06 mg/L.
  - Patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC of ≥0.12 mg/L and ceftriaxone MIC of <1.0 mg/L should receive ceftriaxone or cefotaxime.
  - In patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae with a penicillin MIC of ≥0.12 mg/L and a cephalosporin MIC of ≥1.0 mg/L, the use of cephalosporins alone, even in high doses, may be inadequate. The addition of **vancomycin** ± rifampin to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone appears to enhance bacterial eradication in the CSF. Infectious diseases consultation should be sought in cases of resistant pneumococcus with a penicillin MIC ≥0.12 mg/L.
  - Moxifloxacin, a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone, may be an option (if the isolate is susceptible) in the rare event of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and meropenem, or true anaphylaxis. However, caution is recommended, as fluoroquinolones are not standard therapy for meningitis, and resistance can develop rapidly.
- The usual duration of therapy depends on host factors and the causative pathogen. General guidelines for duration of therapy for some common pathogens are shown in [Table 2](#c0095n00020).​[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)​[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C) Future studies in children may result in recommendations for shorter courses.​[[46]](#MolyneuxENizamiSQSahaSEtAl.5Versus1-6371CDB3) If complications arise, duration of therapy is usually prolonged.
- Although meropenem may be used, imipenem is not recommended for the treatment of bacterial meningitis because it is thought to increase the risk of seizures more than meropenem; the true risk of seizures is unclear.
- Vancomycin can cause a rash with the infusion (vancomycin flushing syndrome) due to mast cell release of histamine if the infusion is given too quickly and should not be misdiagnosed as an allergy.
- If resistant pneumococci are isolated in a patient who has received dexamethasone, strongly consider the addition of rifampin.​[[47]](#TunkelARHartmanBJKaplanSLEtAl.Pract-662546B4)​[[48]](#VanDeBeekDDeGansJTunkelAREtAl.Commu-6625815B)

**Table 1:** Bacterial Meningitis: Probable Pathogens and Empiric Therapy Based on Age and Underlying Host Characteristics​[[3]](#vandeBeek)[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C)

| Age and/or characteristics | Bacteria | Empiric Antibacterial Regimen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infants <1 month | Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) Escherichia coli Other Enterobacteriaceae Listeria monocytogenes (rare) | Ampicillin + cefotaxime ​ [a] Add gentamicin ​ [b] if early neonatal meningitis suspected due to synergy for group B streptococcal infections If Gram negative bacilli on initial CSF Gram stain, strongly consider empiric meropenem |
| Children ≥1 month | S. pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis S. agalactiae (group B streptococcus) Haemophilus influenzae type a or b​ [c] E. coli (rare) L. monocytogenes (rare) Other Enterobacteriaceae (rare) | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime ± vancomycin ​ [d] ​ [e] |
| Adults (with none of the underlying health conditions listed below) | S. pneumoniae N. meningitidis H. influenzae type a Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (rare) | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime ± vancomycin ​ [d] ​ [e] |
| Adults with any of the following: age >60 y, chemotherapy, HIV, pregnancy, humoral immune deficiency states, e.g., agammaglobulinemia , exposure to biologic therapy (especially eculizumab), malignancy, transplantation, alcohol use disorder or any parenchymal involvement in the brainstem | S. pneumoniae N. meningitidis H. influenzae type b L. monocytogenes | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + ampicillin ± vancomycin ​ [d] ​ [e] |
| Any age with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks or skull fractures,​ [f] meningitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts​ [g] , or penetrating head trauma​ [h] | Staphylococcus epidermidis S. aureus S. pneumoniae N. meningitidis H. influenzae type a, b or nontypeable S. pyogenes Aerobic Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas species​ [h] | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + vancomycin ​ [d] ​ [e] Note : if there is traumatic injury with potential soil contamination, replace cefotaxime with ceftazidime and consider adding empiric amphotericin B for fungal coverage |

[a] Cefotaxime is preferred over ceftriaxone in neonates because of the theoretical risk of displacement of bilirubin from albumin and possible subsequent hyperbilirubinemia.

[b] Tobramycin may be substituted for gentamicin.

[c] H. influenzae type b is rare since implementation of universal vaccination.

[d] Vancomycin is included in the initial antibacterial regimen due to potential penicillin-resistant *S. pneumoniae*; however, given high levels of penicillin and ceftriaxone susceptibility, empiric therapy with vancomycin may not be needed.

[e] When administering vancomycin in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin, give the cephalosporin first, followed 2 hours later by vancomycin. Giving the cephalosporin first ensures initial broad coverage and penetration into the CSF.

[f] S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b are the most common pathogens in patients with CSF leaks.

[g] Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus are the most common pathogens associated with VP shunt infections.

[h] Consider adding anaerobic coverage and amphotericin or voriconazole if the wound is contaminated with soil. Aerobic Enterobacteriaceae including Pseudomonas would be potential pathogens associated with penetrating head trauma, particularly if soil contamination.

**Table 2:** Antibacterial Regimens for Specific Pathogens in Uncomplicated Bacterial Meningitis Once Susceptibilities Are Known​[[40]](#Bennett-F5FE218)[[41]](#Long-1F5FEB3C)

| Pathogen | First Line | Alternative | Duration​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae (susceptible to penicillin)​ [b] | Penicillin G | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime | 10 days |
| S. pneumoniae (non-susceptible to penicillin [intermediate or resistant] and susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone)​ [b] | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime Consult infectious diseases specialist | Meropenem .​ [c] Consult infectious diseases specialist | 10 days |
| S. pneumoniae (non-susceptible to penicillin [intermediate or resistant] and non-susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone)​ [b] | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime (high dose) + vancomycin ± rifampin Consult infectious diseases specialist | Meropenem .​ [c] Consult infectious diseases specialist | 14 days |
| Neisseria meningitidis (susceptible to penicillin)​ [b] | Penicillin G | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime | 7 days |
| N. meningitidis (non-susceptible to penicillin)​ [b] | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime | Meropenem .​ [c] Consult infectious diseases specialist | 7 days |
| Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase negative) | Ampicillin | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime | 10 days |
| H. influenzae (beta-lactamase positive) | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime | Consult infectious diseases specialist | 10 days |
| Group B streptococcus ( Streptococcus agalactiae ) | Penicillin G + 5–7 days gentamicin or tobramycin for synergy​ [d] | Ampicillin or cefotaxime | 14–21 days |
| Listeria monocytogenes | Ampicillin + 3–7 days gentamicin or tobramycin for synergy​ [d] ​ [45] | Sulfamethoxazole /​ trimethoprim | ≥21 days |
| Enterobacteriaceae ​ [e] | Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime ​ [f] ± gentamicin or tobramycin ​ [g] | Meropenem .​ [c] Consult infectious diseases specialist | 21 days |

[a] General guidelines only; some cases may require a longer duration of therapy.

[b] Susceptibilities using central nervous system breakpoints for thresholds of resistance as reported by the laboratory, e.g., susceptible, intermediate, resistant.

[c] Meropenem is listed on Public Health Agency of Canada’s "[Reserve list for antimicrobial drugs](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/antibiotic-antimicrobial-resistance/reserve-list-antimicrobial-drugs.html)" and should only be used when resistance has been established or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consultation with infectious disease specialist is recommended.

[d] The addition of gentamicin or tobramycin provides in vitro and in vivo synergy. Gentamicin or tobramycin therapy should be administered for 3–7 days, but may be continued longer in the case of delayed sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

[e] Therapy may be different depending on suspected pathogen and susceptibilities.

[f] Ampicillin can be used if organism is susceptible.

[g] Pediatric guidelines recommend adding gentamicin or tobramycin; however, it is recommended in adults only for P. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime should be used if P. aeruginosa is suspected. Antibacterial choice should be guided by resistance pattern.

### Adjunctive Corticosteroids

Adjuvant corticosteroids are used in order to decrease the inflammation associated with infection of the central nervous system and therefore decrease the neurologic sequelae, which include deafness, strokes, blindness and cognitive impairment. Thrombosis can also be a late sequelae of acute meningitis. If corticosteroids are administered, they should be initiated either before or with the first dose of antimicrobials. The known beneficial effects are recognized with H. influenzae type b in children and S. pneumoniae in adults; however, not with meningitis due to other bacterial pathogens such as Listeria.

A theoretical concern regarding the use of dexamethasone in meningitis is the potential for delayed sterilization of the CSF (due to altered CSF drug penetration) in individuals treated with vancomycin for resistant S. pneumoniae. There are no large clinical studies to answer this question. As stated above, strongly consider the addition of rifampin to the antibacterial regimen if resistant pneumococci are isolated in a patient who has received dexamethasone.​[[47]](#TunkelARHartmanBJKaplanSLEtAl.Pract-662546B4)​[[48]](#VanDeBeekDDeGansJTunkelAREtAl.Commu-6625815B)

### Children

Meta-analyses have found a beneficial effect of adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids in reducing severe hearing loss in children with H. influenzae type b meningitis.​[[49]](#BrouwerMCMcIntyrePPrasadKEtAl.Corti-63725F19) In meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae, the use of dexamethasone showed a trend toward protection against hearing loss. In situations where dexamethasone was given before or at the time of antibacterial administration, the benefit became significant.​[[50]](#McIntyrePBBerkeyCSKingSMSchaadUBKil-63729542)

In a study of infants and children with meningitis, 8.1% received corticosteroids; however, no difference in mortality was observed.​[[18]](#HasbunRWoottonSH-F94A8851)

The use of adjunctive dexamethasone in children >3 months of age with community-acquired bacterial meningitis should be considered after weighing the potential benefits and risks. Ideally, it should be given within 4 hours; however, the UK guidelines published in 2024 suggest that there may be benefit even if given within 12 hours.​[[51]](#NICE2024) The recommended dose for children is 0.6 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 2 days.​[[1]](#LeSauxNCanadianPaediatricSocietyInf-6371CB9C) If cultures do not reveal H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, corticosteroids should be discontinued.

### Adults

A systematic review of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in adults with acute bacterial meningitis did not show an impact on mortality.​[[49]](#BrouwerMCMcIntyrePPrasadKEtAl.Corti-63725F19) In high-income countries, corticosteroids did reduce hearing loss and short-term neurologic sequelae. This same benefit was not seen in resource-poor countries.​[[52]](#MONALISA) A meta-analysis of individual patient data found corticosteroids did not seem to decrease either death or neurologic disability.​[[53]](#VanDeBeekDFarrarJJDeGansJEtAl.Adjun-63734636) On balance, for adults in resource-rich countries, the use of adjunctive dexamethasone is initially recommended in cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, as it might offer some benefit, especially for hearing loss and neurologic sequelae. If Listeria is suspected, corticosteroid therapy is not recommended; if already started, it should be discontinued. In a study from France, corticosteroids were associated with a worse outcome in patients with neurolisteriosis.​[[52]](#MONALISA)

The dose for adults has been variable in published studies. Dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours for 4 days has been used.​[[53]](#VanDeBeekDFarrarJJDeGansJEtAl.Adjun-63734636) Practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2–4 days, commencing either before or with the first dose of antibacterials.​[[54]](#NudelmanYTunkelAR.BacterialMeningit-63737BC5)​[[55]](#TunkelARHartmanBJKaplanSLEtAl.Pract-63739EFF) In adults, if the cultures do not reveal H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, corticosteroids should be discontinued. Dexamethasone should be given early (ideally within 4 hours); however, the UK guidelines published in 2024 suggest that there may be benefit even if given within 12 hours.​[[51]](#NICE2024)

### Prevention

### Vaccines

Vaccines available for the prevention of bacterial meningitis are listed in [Table 5](#drugTable-1151-67089699). A [review of current vaccines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5814812/) available in Canada for children and youth has been published. Other available resources include the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-immunization-guide.html) (CIG) and the [Provincial and Territorial Immunization Information](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html) document.

- The Canadian and global implementation of universal infant immunization programs using conjugated H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis vaccines have significantly decreased the rates of bacterial meningitis. There is also evidence of the development of herd immunity (protection of unvaccinated individuals extending from immunization of a majority of the target population).​[[12]](#MartinNGSadaranganiMPollardAJEtAl.H-6312B218)​[[56]](#DomingoPPomarVBenitoNEtAl.TheChangi-63757F8F)​[[57]](#DeceuninckGDeSerresGBoulianneNEtAl.-6375C270)​[[58]](#DeWalsPDeceuninckGLefebvreBEtAl.Eff-6376DE74)
- The conjugated H. influenzae type b vaccine has led to the virtual disappearance of meningitis due to H. influenzae type b; however, there is emerging evidence regarding the increase in other serotypes such as H. influenzae type a.​[[22]](#TsangRSW-F94B88F1) Conjugate vaccines for serotypes other than type b are not currently available.
- The conjugated **pneumococcal vaccine** is routinely recommended for all infants and is >95% effective in preventing invasive disease caused by the 7 serotypes included in the 7-valent vaccine; preliminary data suggest a further reduction in meningitis due to the additional serotypes included in the 13-valent vaccine, which is now in use.​[[59]](#KaplanSLCenterKJBarsonWJLing-LinPRo-63773D6F) Certain individuals over 2 years of age may be at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and should receive pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Certain high-risk individuals, including adults, may benefit from receiving both pneumococcal conjugated and polysaccharide vaccines. If they have not previously received the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, this should be administered at least 8 weeks after the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
- The conjugated **meningococcal vaccine** against N. meningitidis type C has a reported efficacy of >90% against invasive infection and is routinely given to infants. Quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccines against N. meningitidis types A, C, W and Y-135 are also available for use in individuals over 2 years of age and for certain high-risk groups under 2 years of age.​[[60]](#Crum-CianfloneNSullivanE.Meningococ-63773FAA) High-risk activities include travelling to the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, the Hajj in Mecca, or Saudi Arabia, working in laboratories with potential exposure to N. meningitidis, and persons in crowded or close quarters such as military personnel during deployment. This quadrivalent vaccine is now part of routine childhood or adolescent immunization programs in some provinces and territories in Canada. All patients who are scheduled to start eculizumab should receive available meningococcal vaccines, including both the quadrivalent ACYW conjugated vaccine and meningococcal B vaccine series (4CMenB vaccine is indicated for persons ≥2 months of age; MenB-fHBP vaccine may be considered an option for persons ≥10 years of age) at least 2 weeks prior to starting eculizumab.​[[65]](#PublicHealthAgencyOfCanada.National-6377459D)
- A multicomponent vaccine against N. meningitidis type B (4CMenB) is available for individuals 2 months to 17 years of age. While it is not recommended for routine administration in Canada, 4CMenB is recommended for patients considered to be at high risk, such as those with functional or anatomic asplenia, sickle cell disease or complement deficiency, or close contacts of cases of meningitis B, and for outbreak management for a targeted strain. In otherwise healthy individuals, including infants, decisions regarding administration of 4CMenB should be made on an individual basis after assessment of risk.​[[61]](#RecommendationsForSerogroupBMeningo-63774172)​[[62]](#RobinsonJL.ImmunizationForMeningoco-63774356) In the United Kingdom, universal implementation of the 4CMenB vaccine in infants has shown a vaccine efficacy of over 80% with a 2-dose series.​[[63]](#ParikhSRAndrewsNJBeebeejaunKEtAl.Ef-6CD63453)
- Another meningococcal group B vaccine is a bivalent recombinant lipoprotein vaccine, MenB-fHBP, which is available for persons 10 years of age and older. All patients who are scheduled to start eculizumab should receive the meningococcal type b vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab.

### Intrapartum Prophylaxis for Prevention of Neonatal Early-Onset GBS Meningitis

- The administration of intrapartum antimicrobials (e.g., penicillin) to prevent birth parent-to-child transmission significantly reduces the incidence of early-onset invasive neonatal GBS infections, including meningitis.​[[64]](#MoneyDAllenVM.ThePreventionOfEarly--6377478F)

### Postexposure Prophylaxis

- Close contacts (such as household contacts) of individuals with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are at increased risk of developing meningitis; this risk persists up to 1 year after disease in the index case. Therefore, meningococcal vaccines should also be given if the serogroup of IMD is vaccine-preventable.​[[65]](#PublicHealthAgencyOfCanada.National-6377459D)
- Close contacts of individuals with invasive disease (including meningitis) caused by either H. influenzae type b or N. meningitidis are at up to a 100-fold increased risk of developing infection. Close contacts are generally considered household members or persons in the same daycare, dormitory or military unit. Local public health units generally assist in contact tracing for these cases, which may also include individuals directly exposed to a patient’s oral secretions within 7 days of symptom onset.
- To reduce the risk of infection, postexposure prophylaxis is therefore recommended for close contacts. Prophylaxis should be initiated within 24 hours of identification of the index case; see [Table 3](#MeningitisPEP) for antibacterial selection and [Table 6](#drugTable-1152-6DC133B9) for dosing information. Similar criteria can be applied for H. influenzae type a. For H. influenzae type b, chemoprophylaxis (as soon as possible) is recommended for all household members with any of the following persons in household:

  - child <4 years of age who is not or who is incompletely immunized
  - child <12 months with incomplete primary immunization
  - child who is immunocompromised
- For school or childcare contacts, contact public health for guidance.
- Index cases of meningitis involving either N. meningitidis or *H. influenzae* where ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was ***not*** used as empiric therapy should also receive prophylaxis prior to discharge to eradicate bacterial carriage.​[[66]](#PurcellBSamuelssonSHahnxe9SJEtAl.Ef-74717792) Patients should remain on droplet contact precautions for 24 hours after the start of therapy.
