### Introduction

Nausea is a symptom (not a diagnosis) that refers to the unpleasant sensation of the imminent need to vomit. Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents with contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Nausea and vomiting may be transient symptoms secondary to a self-limited condition such as viral gastroenteritis or part of more complex medical issues. The underlying cause should be determined when possible. Approaches to treatment are dependent on the associated risk factors and diagnosis, which may include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV); or metabolic, GI, vestibular or neurologic causes, such as motion sickness.​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)

This chapter addresses the management of general nausea and vomiting. The management of cancer chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting is addressed in Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy. The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is addressed in Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

Causes of nausea include:

- Neurologic/vestibular conditions: stroke, increased intracranial pressure, migraine, neoplasm, pain, head injury, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, motion sickness
- Drugs/toxins: alcohol, antibiotics, bacterial food poisoning, cannabis, chemotherapy, hormones, opioids, NSAIDs, antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, digoxin, benzodiazepines, SSRIs, noxious odours, anesthesia, radiation therapy, or medication initiation, withdrawal or toxicity
- GI conditions: viral gastroenteritis, constipation, diseases of the liver (including hepatitis), cholecystitis, pancreatitis, chronic idiopathic nausea, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome, nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux, GI motility disorders
- Psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, fear, grief, eating disorders, functional nausea, anticipatory nausea (situations in which patients are conditioned by previous experience of nausea and vomiting, e.g., chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting)
- Medical conditions: Addison disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, hormonal effects of pregnancy, severe heart failure, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, malignancy (including metastasis), myocardial infarction, uremia, acute infections

Complications of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting include esophageal rupture, Mallory-Weiss tears, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, malnutrition, and dental caries.

### Goals of Therapy

- Eliminate nausea and vomiting or reduce its severity, frequency and duration to a level acceptable to the patient (nausea can be more distressing to some patients than actual vomiting and interferes significantly with quality of life)
- Correct any consequences of persistent nausea (with or without vomiting) such as electrolyte abnormalities or nutritional compromise
- Prevent complications of nausea and vomiting
- Prevent recurrence of nausea and vomiting
- Decrease time off work and lifestyle disruptions caused by nausea and vomiting

### Investigations

- History:​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)

  - ascertain the frequency and severity of nausea as well as the timing in relation to meals, time of day, emotion or stress
  - clarify the relationship between nausea and vomiting; if vomiting occurs, determine the amount and nature of the vomitus
  - in all women of reproductive age, inquire about last menstrual period to rule out pregnancy
  - explore possible underlying causes and whether they are simple versus complex, acute or chronic
  - complete an appropriate GI functional inquiry including frequency and nature of bowel movements, early satiety, postprandial symptoms, abdominal pain or weight loss
  - identify other symptoms, e.g., headache, pain, vertigo
  - inquire about diet history including any new foods, food allergies or intolerances, and if potentially contaminated food has been consumed
  - establish any exposure to, or other symptoms of, infection such as gastroenteritis or exposure to others who are ill
  - inquire about past history of migraine headaches, endocrine disorders and malignancy
  - establish the onset, progression and temporal sequence of associated events, e.g., surgery
  - obtain a thorough medication history including use of prescription, nonprescription, herbal or recreational drugs (including cannabis) as well as alcohol, nutritional supplements and vitamins
  - inquire about recent changes to drug regimens (dosage increases or withdrawal) and correlation with nausea
  - explore possible psychosocial stressors, conflicts, and sources of emotional pain or loss
  - explore the patient’s illness experience by inquiring about feelings, concerns, ideas, functional impairment and expectations of treatment
- Physical examination:

  - vital signs including BP, pulse, respiratory rate and temperature
  - determine severity and consequences of symptoms—assess hydration including jugular venous pressure (JVP), mucous membranes, skin turgor, and postural changes in blood pressure and heart rate
  - assess systems related to the probable underlying cause when apparent, e.g., perform neurologic exam for a migraine patient, examine for bowel obstruction if the patient has a malignancy or is postsurgical, check for nystagmus in vertigo-associated nausea, and inspect fundi for papilledema
  - if no specific cause is identified in the history, use the physical exam to rule out other potential causes, e.g., abdominal mass
- Other investigations, if indicated by the history and physical exam:

  - metabolic panel if metabolic disturbances are suspected, e.g., test for hypercalcemia in a patient with a malignancy, glucose in a diabetic patient, hypokalemia or hyponatremia in a patient on diuretics, and serum lipase/amylase levels if pancreatitis is suspected
  - CBC and differential if an infective cause is suspected
  - pregnancy test for females of childbearing age
  - serum creatinine and urea to determine whether there is a renal cause and assess degree of dehydration
  - drug levels in select cases, e.g., digoxin, anticonvulsants
  - liver function tests
  - thyroid function or fasting cortisol levels may be helpful to rule out endocrine disorders
  - x-rays may also be indicated: an abdominal x-ray if a bowel obstruction is suspected or an upper GI series with motility studies if gastroesophageal reflux or gastroparesis is suspected
  - ultrasound of the liver, gallbladder or pancreas may be useful in some patients
  - upper GI endoscopy or CT of the abdomen may be required in select patients as determined by the history and physical
  - CT of the head should be considered if an intracranial cause is suspected

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

To manage nausea and vomiting through general nonpharmacologic measures:​[[2]](#2013Anderson)

- Ensure adequate hydration (PO or IV if appropriate)
- Advise patients to avoid smells and foods that cause nausea
- Recommend consumption of frequent small meals and snacks rather than large meals at infrequent intervals
- Suggest dietary interventions that may help with nausea associated with certain food intolerances; consult a dietitian when necessary
- Suggest relaxation therapy and cognitive behavioural therapies that may be useful in the treatment of nausea associated with irritable bowel syndrome and anticipatory nausea​[[1]](#psc1030n00041)
- Treat pain if nausea and pain coexist; successful treatment often reduces the nausea
- Engage patient in the decisions around treatment. Not every patient will want treatment; watchful waiting is an alternative for these individuals
- Reassure patient when underlying cause is self-limited

To prevent motion sickness, counsel patients to:​[[3]](#Brainard2014)

- Avoid eating a large meal within 3 hours of travel
- Avoid dairy products and foods high in protein, calories or sodium before travel
- Avoid alcohol, smoking and disagreeable odours during travel
- Increase ventilation and exposure to cool fresh air
- Minimize head movement by pressing head into headrest
- Avoid visual stimuli that commonly precipitate motion sickness, such as reading or watching videos during travel
- Focus on a stable external object or the horizon during travel
- Stay in a central location while on a boat, which is the least susceptible to motion
- Sit in the front seat of a vehicle with a clear forward view and, if possible, drive the vehicle rather than be a passenger

Acupressure wristbands (Sea-Bands) have not been shown to be beneficial for preventing motion sickness. In a controlled study of experimental motion sickness, neither acupressure nor acustimulation were of benefit;​[[4]](#psc1030n00070) however, a systematic review found no difference between antiemetic drugs and stimulation of the PC6 acupoint on the wrist in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.​[[5]](#Lee2015)

Aromatherapy with inhaled isopropyl alcohol pads (held 1–2 cm below the nostrils) has been shown to be more effective than placebo​[[6]](#Beadle2016) or ondansetron​[[7]](#April2018) in reducing nausea symptoms within 30 minutes postintervention in adults in the emergency department.

Maintaining fluid intake helps prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. The amount of fluid required depends on the amount lost through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Adults require 1–3 L of total water intake to maintain normal hydration status.​[[8]](#ctc1030n00066) In patients who are vomiting several times daily, additional fluid intake may be needed. For mild dehydration, drinking adequate amounts of water may be all that is required. To treat moderate to severe dehydration, it is necessary to replace electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium). Oral rehydration solutions with appropriate amounts of electrolytes are recommended under these circumstances.​[[9]](#ctc1030n00067)

### Pharmacologic Choices

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Selected agents used in the management of nausea and vomiting are described in [Table 1](#c0111n00014).​[[10]](#psc1030n00083)​[[11]](#psc1030n00084) For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting, consult Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

When selecting a drug, consider whether the nausea is acute or chronic, review concurrent medications, and attempt to identify the underlying cause of nausea (see [Figure 1](#psc1030n00006)). A preventive approach may be appropriate in certain situations, for example, in the management of motion sickness. Many patients cannot tolerate oral medications when nauseated, and alternative routes of administration (IM, IV, SC, rectal or transdermal) may be more suitable.

For treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with viral gastroenteritis, there is no evidence that one antiemetic is superior to another. The initial choice should be made on the basis of previous response, available routes of administration, cost, adverse effects and patient preference. These criteria often result in diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate being tried first. Dimenhydrinate consists of 2 drugs (diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline) and must be metabolized to its active ingredient, diphenhydramine, resulting in a slower onset of action.​[[12]](#PharmacologyText2019)

If symptoms are worsened by movement, it may be surmised that acetylcholine is a significant contributor, and anticholinergic agents such as first generation antihistamines, e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate or hydroxyzine, may be tried first. If symptoms are associated with a feeling of fullness in the stomach, a prokinetic agent such as metoclopramide or domperidone may be a logical starting point. Caution is warranted with these agents since domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death​[[13]](#HealthCanadaDomperidone) and metoclopramide is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (even in children) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw). If patients fail to respond to these initial measures, base selection of other antiemetics on adverse effects, available routes of administration, patient preference and cost. Consider trying agents with different mechanisms of action if combinations of antiemetics are to be used.

### Motion Sickness

Since acetylcholine and histamine are thought to be the most important neurotransmitters causing motion sickness, it follows that anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs are fairly effective in controlling it. Prevention is more effective than treatment in established nausea and vomiting.

- For short duration of exposure, diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate are effective for most patients. Because motion sickness induces gut stasis, it is important to take oral medications at least 60 minutes in advance of travel.​[[14]](#ctc1030n00046)​[[15]](#ctc1030n00047)
- Scopolamine transdermal patch applied at least 4 hours before exposure is effective and the duration of action is up to 3 days.​[[16]](#psc1030n00086)
- Promethazine has a longer duration of action as compared with dimenhydrinate and may be an alternative in patients with refractory nausea or when dimenhydrinate is ineffective.
- If alertness is required, transdermal scopolamine or oral promethazine may be combined with dextroamphetamine or ephedrine.​[[16]](#psc1030n00086)​[[17]](#psc1030n00087) These combinations have been used in extreme situations (e.g., by airline pilots) after the patient has become thoroughly accustomed to the CNS effects of these drugs, as they may be unpredictable.​[[18]](#psc1030n00088)
- The most appropriate agent for children older than 2 years of age is dimenhydrinate given 1 hour before exposure, then every 6 hours as needed. Some children experience paradoxical excitability, so a test dose should be administered well before travelling.​[[19]](#2007CPSAirTravel)
- Controlled clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated the benefit of ginger **root** for motion sickness, although it is widely promoted for its antinausea effects.​[[20]](#2013Palatty23638927)

### Opioid-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Therapeutic options for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting include the following:

- Alter the administration schedule so that nausea does not interfere with meals.
- Reduce the dose of the opioid as low as possible or avoid large increases in the opioid dose since this may lead to comparatively large increases in the opioid’s serum concentrations, which may in turn induce or worsen nausea and vomiting.
- If pain is not controlled, attempt an increase in dosage since nausea is sometimes caused by pain.
- Consider switching to another opioid at 75% of the equivalent daily dose. No solid evidence for differences between opioids exists in terms of emetogenicity, but patient responses are highly variable.​[[21]](#ctc1030n00064)
- Addition of an antiemetic drug is often helpful, although the possibility of additive CNS side effects must be carefully weighed. Appropriate antiemetic agents include diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, haloperidol and ondansetron.​[[21]](#ctc1030n00064)​[[22]](#ctc1030n00063)
- When managing refractory opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, instead of replacing one antiemetic agent with another, adding additional therapies with different mechanisms of action may result in a synergistic effect.
- Tolerance to nausea and vomiting frequently develops in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. However, changes to the opioid drug therapy regimen should be made as part of a team approach, closely involving the patient’s other health-care practitioners.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Since dimenhydrinate is recommended for augmenting pyridoxine treatment in pregnancy​[[23]](#2018ACOG29266076) and is considered generally safe in pregnancy, it can be considered for intermittent therapy of motion sickness in pregnant patients. Promethazine may also be used.​[[23]](#2018ACOG29266076)

See Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy for therapeutic choices in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can also be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding; other specialized reference sources are provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Preemptive treatment may reduce nausea with certain procedures, e.g., insertion of a nasogastric tube.
- When a more complex cause is suspected, antiemetics may provide some symptomatic relief; however, when possible, determine and treat the underlying cause.
- When prescribing for the elderly, start with a low dose and increase the dose slowly.
- Combination antiemetic therapy may be required for the treatment of moderate to severe nausea and vomiting.
- If management of a nauseated patient fails to provide some symptomatic relief, reassess the patient and look for other causes.
- Know a few medications well. If one medication fails, try a different class of antiemetics or an alternative route of administration.
- Start with less expensive choices unless there is a preferred antiemetic for a specific disorder.
