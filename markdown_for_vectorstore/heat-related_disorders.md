### Introduction

Heat-related illnesses and related mortality are largely preventable.​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[2]](#Ebi_Lancet) There is a wide spectrum of heat-related disorders, ranging from mild heat rash or heat edema to potentially fatal heat stroke. Although incidence of heat-related disorders are difficult to quantify,​[[3]](#Boucharma) it is recognized that deaths due to heat-related disorders are under-reported, as cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses also increase during heat waves and may not be attributed directly to the heat.​[[4]](#Patz-5EE1F9FF) With timely treatment, the mortality rate for heat stroke has been estimated to be around 10%, but when treatment is delayed, death can occur in up to 80% of cases.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) The incidence of these disorders increases with higher temperatures and humidity (i.e., during an extended heat wave). A study of hospital admissions during heat waves found that older adults had a 2.5-fold increase in risk of being hospitalized for heat stroke compared with non–heat wave periods.​[[6]](#BobbJFObermeyerZWangYDominiciF.Caus-5EE0BEE7) As changes to the environment are leading to longer and more frequent and intense heat events, the incidence of heat stress disorders is likely to increase.​[[7]](#psc1010n1004) Health-care practitioners need to actively promote preventive measures and recognize symptoms requiring immediate action.

### Pathophysiology

The body’s thermoregulatory centre (the hypothalamus) is responsible for the maintenance of core body temperature (approximately 37°C).​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[3]](#Boucharma) The body acquires heat through different sources or processes including shivering, physical activity and high ambient temperatures. Heat illness results from an imbalance of heat generated within and absorbed by the body and its ability to dissipate excessive heat.​[[3]](#Boucharma) Because heat dissipation occurs primarily through the skin, preventing or correcting a heat imbalance requires normal skin condition as well as sufficient cardiac output and blood volume to maintain adequate blood flow to the skin.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[8]](#XuZEtzelRASuHHuangCGuoYTongS.Impact-5EEDAEE0)

The body eliminates heat by 4 different mechanisms:​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)

- Evaporation is the transfer of heat when a liquid is converted to a gas. In low-humidity conditions, evaporation is an effective mechanism of heat dissipation. This mechanism becomes more important at higher ambient temperatures when evaporation of perspiration is key.
- Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves. It accounts for about 65% of heat loss when ambient temperature is lower than body temperature. At higher ambient temperatures, heat gain can result.
- Conduction is the transfer of heat through physical contact with a cooler object. At higher temperatures, conduction is the least effective of the 4 mechanisms.
- Convection is the transfer of heat to the air and vapour. Both air flow and vasodilation contribute to heat loss by convection.

A reduction in the efficacy of any of the above mechanisms can lead to heat accumulation and increase the risk of developing a heat-related illness. In temperate climates, radiation is the key mechanism to dissipate heat.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) In hotter climates, evaporation is the most important mechanism; however, when humidity is high, evaporation plays a lesser role.​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP) If not treated in time, excessive body temperature initiates a series of processes that leads to the collapse of the cardiovascular system, multiorgan failure and potentially death.​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)

### Heat-Related Illness Spectrum

There is a wide spectrum of heat-related disorders, ranging from heat rash to heat stroke. [Figure 1](#SpectrumHRD) outlines the different heat-related disorders that individuals might experience.

There are 2 types of heat stroke: classic and exertional. Hallmark symptoms of both include an elevated body temperature of over 40°C (measured rectally as this is the most reliable method to determine body temperature compared with oral or tympanic methods; see Fever for more information) and changes in mental status. Older individuals with predisposing health risks who are exposed to risky environmental conditions usually present with classic heat stroke. These patients differ from those suffering from exertional heat stroke in that they typically present with hot, dry skin because of difficulty perspiring.​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[9]](#HC_HCP)

Exertional heat stroke, as its name depicts, usually occurs in younger, healthy individuals who have participated in strenuous physical activity. Competitive athletes and military personnel are typical population groups that develop this form of heat stroke, distinguished by the presence of profuse sweating.​[[9]](#HC_HCP)

### Risk Factors

A number of demographic and patient-specific factors (e.g., age, chronic conditions, medication use) as well as behavioural (e.g., participation in strenuous activity) and environmental factors (e.g., relative humidity levels, air temperature) play an important role in determining the risk for developing a heat-related illness. [Table 1](#psc1010n00007) outlines these risk factors.

Several population groups are at risk of developing heat-related disorders; these include:​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[8]](#XuZEtzelRASuHHuangCGuoYTongS.Impact-5EEDAEE0)​[[16]](#GrootEAbelsohnAMooreK.PracticalStra-5EEE06A8)

- Infants and young children
- Older adults
- Outdoor labourers, e.g., firefighters, military personnel
- Competitive athletes
- Individuals in poor socioeconomic situations

Children were thought to be at increased risk of heat-related illnesses due to physiological and anatomical differences (e.g., reduced sweating due to a greater surface area to body mass ratio, immature thermoregulatory system) and a reduced thirst response to dehydration as compared with healthy adults.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[8]](#XuZEtzelRASuHHuangCGuoYTongS.Impact-5EEDAEE0)​[[16]](#GrootEAbelsohnAMooreK.PracticalStra-5EEE06A8) However, some recent information suggests that these differences are not as significant, especially in older children.​[[10]](#AAP-FA61C63F) Infants and preschool children are still considered an at-risk group, partly due to the dependence of young children on others to ensure they stay hydrated and are removed from risky environments, e.g., the inside of a car in hot weather.​[[8]](#XuZEtzelRASuHHuangCGuoYTongS.Impact-5EEDAEE0) Regardless of the reason, caregivers need to be mindful of the potential risks when exposing this population to hot and humid environments.

Older adults are predisposed to heat illnesses because of comorbid illnesses (including cardiovascular limitations and pulmonary disease), multiple medications and poor thermoregulatory response.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[6]](#BobbJFObermeyerZWangYDominiciF.Caus-5EE0BEE7)​[[16]](#GrootEAbelsohnAMooreK.PracticalStra-5EEE06A8) Social and behavioural factors such as home containment (not leaving the home on a daily basis), social isolation, bed confinement and an inability to provide self-care put this population at particular risk, especially in more dependent older adults.​[[6]](#BobbJFObermeyerZWangYDominiciF.Caus-5EE0BEE7)​[[11]](#psc1010n1006)​[[16]](#GrootEAbelsohnAMooreK.PracticalStra-5EEE06A8)

In addition to heat-related disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory deterioration have long been identified as consequences of heat waves. An association has been found between heat exposure and higher hospital admission rates in older adults for fluid-related disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infections and septicemia.​[[6]](#BobbJFObermeyerZWangYDominiciF.Caus-5EE0BEE7) The risk of these additional health consequences increased as the period and intensity of the heat wave increased and remained elevated for up to 5 days after the heat wave.

**Table 1:** Common Risk Factors for Developing Heat-Related Illnesses​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)[[3]](#Boucharma)[[5]](#psc1010n1002)[[6]](#BobbJFObermeyerZWangYDominiciF.Caus-5EE0BEE7)[[7]](#psc1010n1004)[[10]](#AAP-FA61C63F)[[11]](#psc1010n1006)[[12]](#MartinezMDevenportLSaussyJEtAl.Drug-5EEDBBF7)[[13]](#BouchamaADehbiMMohamedGEtAl.Prognos-5EF0F410)[[14]](#CrowleyRAHealthAndPublicPolicyCommi-07DD0FE0)[[15]](#MitchellBL-FA632269)

| Demographic/Medical Factors | Behavioural/Environmental Factors |
| Age (young children, elderly) Alcohol-related disorders Bed confinement Cardiovascular disorders Dehydration Dermatologic conditions (e.g., burns, eczema, psoriasis) Diabetes Fever Homelessness Hyperthyroidism Lower socioeconomic status Obesity Peripheral vascular disease Past heat injury Psychiatric disorders Pulmonary disorders Recent illness (e.g., viral infection) Sickle cell trait Use of medications listed in Table 2 | High humidity High temperatures overnight for several consecutive nights Inability to perform self-care Lack of acclimatization Lack of air conditioning or ventilation Lack of breaks during exercise Lack of sleep Living in urban areas with greater number of paved surfaces and buildings Poor physical condition Social isolation Strenuous activity in hot, humid conditions Use of heavy clothing or equipment |

### Medication-Related Causes

Medications listed in [Table 2](#psc1010n00009) can predispose patients to heat-related disorders through various mechanisms that include:

- Inhibition of sweat excretion (anticholinergic effects and hypovolemic causes)
- Vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels
- Disruption of hypothalamic thermoregulation
- Increased heat production
- Increased fluid loss through diarrhea or vomiting leading to dehydration

**Table 2:** Medications that Can Predispose to Heat-Related Illnesses​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)[[2]](#Ebi_Lancet)[[8]](#XuZEtzelRASuHHuangCGuoYTongS.Impact-5EEDAEE0)[[9]](#HC_HCP)[[11]](#psc1010n1006)[[12]](#MartinezMDevenportLSaussyJEtAl.Drug-5EEDBBF7)[[17]](#psc1010n1011)[[18]](#psc1010n1012)

| Mechanism | Drug/Class​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| Increased heat production | Excessive thyroid medication Sympathomimetics |
| Inhibition of hypothalamic regulation | Amphetamines (including MDMA/“ecstasy”) Antipsychotics Opioids |
| Reduction of sweat excretion (either by direct effects on the skin/sweat glands or through reduced blood flow to the skin) | Alcohol Anticholinergics Antihistamines Antiparkinsonian (anticholinergic) agents Antipsychotics (anticholinergic) Belladonna alkaloids Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers Creatine​ [b] Diuretics Laxatives Lithium Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Topiramate Tricyclic antidepressants |
| Vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels | Alpha-agonists Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Sympathomimetics (including pseudoephedrine, cocaine, amphetamines, diet products containing ma huang) |

[a] In addition, any medication or substance (e.g., tranquilizers, cocaine, cannabis) that can alter a person’s behaviour, including the perception of the environment or need for proper hydration, may increase the risk of heat-related illnesses in the right conditions.​[[12]](#MartinezMDevenportLSaussyJEtAl.Drug-5EEDBBF7)

[b] Evidence has been contradictory; however, use of creatine ≤28 days or when exercising ≤60 min does not appear to influence hydration status or temperature regulation.​[[19]](#psc1010n01036) It is not clear whether creatine use >28 days or when exercising >60 min affects thermoregulation.

### Prevention

Prevention of heat-related illnesses is the primary goal. The first step in prevention is identifying individuals at risk (see [Table 1](#psc1010n00007)). Health-care practitioners can offer proactive education and tips for these population groups, and when possible, could check on identified at-risk patients during heat waves.​[[16]](#GrootEAbelsohnAMooreK.PracticalStra-5EEE06A8) For example, through a medication review, pharmacists can proactively identify and provide guidance to individuals who take medications that may predispose them to heat-related illnesses. Examples of such guidance include modification of strenuous activities, adequate hydration, taper/cessation of discretionary medications, as appropriate.

If possible, encourage these individuals to move to an air-conditioned location and encourage them to participate in social activities or set up regular check-ins by a neighbour, friend or family member. Both have been shown to lower the risk of heat-related deaths during heat waves. Fluid intake should be increased without waiting for the appearance of thirst.​[[20]](#psc1010n01030) Other potentially helpful measures include taking cool showers or baths.​[[13]](#BouchamaADehbiMMohamedGEtAl.Prognos-5EF0F410)

Practitioners can recommend athletes with risk factors or who have experienced a previous episode of a heat-related illness and who engage in activities in at-risk environments (e.g., use of heavy equipment, in buildings without air conditioning during a heat wave) to consider a pre-season medical assessment.​[[21]](#CasaDJ-FA643FA9)​[[22]](#PryorRR-FA64646E)

Review of online weather reports and forecasts (e.g., [Environment Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/), [The Weather Network](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca)) can help predict environmental situations where the risk of heat stroke is increased and vigilant monitoring of at-risk individuals is indicated. A humidex reading of 40 or higher in a weather report is considered extremely high and preventative actions should be taken.​[[23]](#HeatHumidity)

Health Canada has a [toolkit](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/hc-sc/migration/hc-sc/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/climat/heat-chaleur/heat-chaleur-eng.pdf) intended for use by public health and emergency management officials to warn Canadians about impending heat events. Health-care practitioners may find many aspects of the toolkit useful in developing a communication plan for their own patients and reinforcing the public health message.

If outdoor activities cannot be avoided during periods of high temperature and humidity, the following strategies are recommended to help reduce the risk of heat-related disorders:

- Ensure proper hydration before the activity. Athletes training or competing in the heat should drink 6 mL of fluid/kg body weight every few hours before the activity.​[[24]](#RacinaisS-FA64D8F6)
- Drink cool fluids to maintain urine output and produce urine of light colour; during the activity typically 200–300 mL of fluids are recommended every 10–20 minutes (approximately 1–1.5 L per hour of activity).​[[24]](#RacinaisS-FA64D8F6)​[[25]](#psc1010n1013) Thirst should not be relied upon as a reminder to drink.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) **Oral** rehydration solutions or sport drinks are useful, as they contain sodium and glucose that are lost during exercise. However, it is important to remind people of salt and sugar content in sports drinks and to avoid them in those patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, renal failure or fluid restrictions.
- Stay out of the sun if possible. Take 10–20 minute breaks per hour of activity, either in the shade or in an air-conditioned environment.​[[26]](#psc1010n1014)​[[27]](#psc1010n1016)
- Avoid strenuous outdoor activities during peak sun hours (10 a.m. to 3 p.m.).
- Wear light-coloured, lightweight clothing, including a wide-brimmed hat.​[[25]](#psc1010n1013)
- Acclimatize to the environment. Gradual exposure to ambient conditions can prevent heat-related illnesses. The average adult should start at about 50% of expected activity in the environment, increasing gradually to 80% over a few days. However, the recommendation for workers not accustomed to the heat is to start at 20% of expected activity and increase by 20% daily. Up to 10–14 days of exposure is required for full acclimatization in a hot environment.​[[27]](#psc1010n1016)​[[28]](#psc1010n1015) In children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends progressive exposure to the environmental and exercise conditions, typically over a 10–14 day period.​[[10]](#AAP-FA61C63F)

[Figure 2](#fig-11721-7CB43D6E) provides a stepwise approach to aiding patients in the prevention of heat-related disorders.

### Goals of Therapy

Prevention of any heat-related disorder is the foremost goal. However, once an individual is displaying symptoms, the goals of therapy are to:

- Reduce mortality
- Normalize body temperature
- Reduce and eliminate symptoms
- Prevent long-term consequences

### Patient Assessment

Information about the assessment of patients with a suspected heat-related disorder can be found in [Figure 3](#psc1010n00010).​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[29]](#psc1010n01031)

Symptoms of various heat-related problems present differently depending on the degree or stage of the illness. Patients’ complaints range from edema in the feet to more serious concerns of confusion or coma. The spectrum of disorders is described (from mildest to most severe) in [Table 3](#psc1010n00011).

If any acute neurologic symptoms (e.g., altered mental status, confusion or hallucinations, seizures) are present, the person must be taken to the hospital immediately to be assessed and treated. In addition to heat stroke, differential diagnoses include meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperthyroidism, encephalopathy, tetanus, delirium, and overdose of various substances including cocaine and salicylates.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)

Other hyperthermia syndromes include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and malignant hyperthermia (MH); however, the underlying causes are drug-related rather than heat-related. Both NMS and MH present with hyperthermia and muscle rigidity but have different etiologies; NMS is induced by antipsychotics and MH by inhaled anesthetics or succinylcholine (postsurgery) in susceptible individuals. Further discussion regarding NMS and MH is outside the scope of this chapter.

| Type of Illness | Features/Symptoms | Therapy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heat rash | “Prickly heat” that appears as a group of small blisters or rash Due to irritation from excessive sweating Usually located on the neck, upper chest, under the breasts, in the groin area or in elbow creases | Retreat to a cooler and less humid environment Keep the area dry |
| Heat edema | Edema in the extremities from transient vasodilation of vessels, sodium and water retention, and with prolonged standing More frequent during the summer months | Elevate feet or hands No specific pharmacologic treatment Prevention with acclimatization |
| Heat cramps | Water and sodium depletion Cramps in muscles of the arms, legs and stomach are most common Warning sign of heat exhaustion Common in athletes | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded area Rehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodium Lightly stretch or massage affected muscles Avoid heavy activity for a few hours See health-care practitioner if no improvement in 1 h or if symptoms worsen |
| Heat syncope | Dizziness Fainting episode | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded area Rehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodium Patients often recover quickly after falling to the ground (secondary to fainting) Slowly get up from a sitting or supine position |
| Heat exhaustion | Weakness Nausea and/or vomiting Tachycardia, hypotension Fatigue Dizziness Headache Slightly elevated core body temperature (up to 40°C ) Fainting Reversible, but can lead to heat stroke if untreated | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded area or in an air-conditioned environment Rehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodium Seek medical attention Recovery is usually quick, within 2–3 h |
| Heat stroke | Medical emergency —can result in death Similar to heat exhaustion with the added feature, in most cases, of neurologic symptoms such as: − altered mental status − hallucinations − seizures − confusion − coma − ataxia Other symptoms include hot, dry skin (in classic heat stroke), profuse sweating (in exertional heat stroke) and core body temperature >40°C Leads to hepatic and renal failure, central nervous system injury, coagulopathy and cardiovascular collapse | Call 911 —take patient to emergency room as soon as possible In the interim: − stop activity immediately and rest in an air-conditioned environment (or, if not possible, a cool, shaded area) − immerse body in cold water (for exertional heat stroke), when practical − cool the body (on the way to the hospital) with ice water towels or packs to the groin, neck, axillae and head − remove excessive clothing − rehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodium − ensure good air circulation around patient |

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

It is imperative to seek emergency medical attention to address heat stroke immediately, as delaying treatment results in poorer patient outcomes.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) While waiting for emergency services, the first priority is to move the patient to a shaded or preferably air-conditioned environment and to cool the patient using external methods such as cool compresses applied to the groin, neck, axillae and head. Increase air flow around the patient and promote evaporation by removing unnecessary clothing, using fans and misting with moderate-temperature water.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) Although often impractical, cold water immersion (temperature 1 to 17 ºC) has been shown to reduce core body temperature in patients suffering from exertional heat stroke.​[[31]](#Douma) Evidence is not strong for the best cooling method in patients suffering from classic heat stroke.​[[3]](#Boucharma) In situations where cold water immersion is not available, other cooling methods as described above should be used.

Other types of heat-related illnesses are not considered emergencies and can be addressed appropriately depending on severity. [Table 3](#psc1010n00011) outlines treatment options for various heat-related disorders.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

Medications such as antipyretics do not help reduce the body’s internal temperature and should *not* be used.

Although not the mainstay of therapy, medications can be helpful in treating some of the complications of heat stroke. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam are used to treat seizures and control shivering. Barbiturates have also been used for seizures if benzodiazepines are not effective. Mannitol is used to promote osmotic diuresis and prevent or treat renal failure in patients with rhabdomyolysis.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002) Dobutamine is the drug of choice for circulatory support.​[[5]](#psc1010n1002)​[[32]](#psc1010n1017)

### Monitoring

Monitoring of individuals at risk of developing heat-related disorders by friends and family is a critical preventive strategy. Health-care practitioners should support patients and caregivers to recognize symptoms that require intervention or medical attention.

For those involved in outdoor activities, proper hydration (see [Prevention](#Prevention)) is important, as thirst is an unreliable sign of body fluid loss. Individuals should aim for maintaining light-yellow urine.

The extent of recommended monitoring of patients who have suffered a heat-related illness depends on the severity of the illness. Patients with heat exhaustion should avoid further heat exposure for 24–48 hours after a mild injury and avoid exercise for at least 7 days after treatment for exertional heat stroke.​[[1]](#Gauer_AFP)​[[28]](#psc1010n1015) Heat stroke patients require more intensive monitoring after hospital discharge to manage potential complications, such as chronic renal failure and other organ damage.
