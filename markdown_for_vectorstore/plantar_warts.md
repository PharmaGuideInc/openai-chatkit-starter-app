### Pathophysiology

Cutaneous warts are benign skin growths caused by infection of the epidermal cells by the human papilloma virus (HPV). There are more than 100 HPV types that have been classified according to their oncogenic potential into low risk (LR) or high risk (HR). Cutaneous warts are caused by LR HPV; mainly types 1–4, 26–29.​[[1]](#Matucci-CerinicCHerzumACiccareseGEt-1EB6A150) HPV is transmitted via direct contact with another lesion or touching contaminated surfaces. The virus enters the skin through small cuts or microabrasions and infects basal epithelial cells. Following an incubation period of 1 to 20 months, the body may clear the infection via cell-mediated immunity, the virus may stay dormant or a clinically apparent infection may develop. In a clinically apparent infection, the virus induces cellular replication, resulting in a hyperkeratinized lesion. Spontaneous resolution occurs in up to 78% of cases within 2 years in the pediatric population; this rate significantly decreases in people older than 12.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[4]](#2011Mulhem21842775)

Warts located on the soles of the feet are known as plantar warts (*verrucae plantaris*) and can appear singly or in clusters of multiple close-grouped warts, known as mosaic warts. Plantar warts can occur at any age but they are rare in children under 5. They are most frequently seen in children over 5 and young adults, with the highest incidence occurring between 12 and 16 years of age.​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[5]](#refitem-1222161-8810E9C2) Risk factors for plantar warts include immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplantation recipients, patients with HIV)​[[6]](#refitem-1232162-882E52EE) and exposure to environments where the virus may contaminate surfaces (close contact with an affected person, swimming pool, communal shower, locker room), wet or macerated skin, and warm, moist environments.​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)

### Goals of Therapy

- Alleviate or prevent pain due to the wart
- Eradicate lesions and prevent their proliferation
- Prevent recurrence
- Prevent transmission to others
- Improve cosmetic appearance

### Patient Assessment

Identification of plantar warts is based on clinical appearance. Plantar warts are often symptomless, producing pain only upon pressure; this pain is usually greater on lateral compression (i.e., pinching) than with direct pressure. They are usually rough, firm hyperkeratosis that, unlike common warts on the hands, grow inward due to pressure from walking. Plantar warts are callous-like lesions that in light skin are usually the same colour as the surrounding skin. In black and brown skin, they may appear paler than the surrounding skin.​[[7]](#MukwendeMTamonyPTurnerM.Hands.InMin-1EB7E10A) Upon débridement, thrombosed capillaries are revealed that may appear as black dots in the centre of the lesion. This feature is particularly helpful for differentiating warts from corns and calluses. In addition, unlike with corns and calluses, skin striations tend to run around the wart, as opposed to through it. Plantar warts tend to arise on areas of higher pressure such as the heel, bottom of the big toe, or the ball of the foot where microabrasions are more likely to occur and allow inoculation.​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[8]](#HogendoornGKBrugginkSCHermansKEEtAl-1EB8559E) [See Photo Plantar Warts](#psc1054n01031).

### Prevention

To reduce the risk factors for developing plantar warts, it is important to maintain skin integrity and minimize exposure to the virus. Advise the following to prevent transmission or acquisition of warts:​​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[9]](#psc1054n1005)

- Avoid walking barefoot in public places and use footwear (e.g., sandals, pool shoes) when in areas where transmission may be more common (e.g., swimming pool decks, gym showers, dormitories)
- Change socks daily and allow shoes to dry between uses
- Keep feet clean and dry; wear well-ventilated footwear
- Do not share towels, socks or footwear
- Avoid touching warts on someone else or on another part of your body
- Do not reuse or share tools used for débriding or abrading warts
- Cover warts to prevent transmission of the virus to others

### Treatment

Most warts are harmless and self-limiting. Decisions about whether and how to treat them should be made through a shared decision-making process involving the patient and/or caregiver. Factors to consider include:​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[10]](#psc1054n1014)

- Exclusions for self-care (diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status, large mosaic warts, peripheral vascular disease)
- Presence and severity of symptoms
- Age (spontaneous resolution more likely in children)
- Psychological distress (concern of cosmetic appearance, social stigma)
- Concern of transmission to self or others
- Treatment characteristics (application frequency, cost, adverse effects)

Most treatments for warts are destructive therapies that are thought to work by destroying, damaging or irritating infected cells and surrounding tissues. This induces a local immune-mediated response to clear the virus. A limited number of therapies work by inhibiting viral replication (5-fluorouracil, imiquimod and bleomycin). No treatments directly kill the HPV virus. Data on the treatment of warts is very limited with a lack of large, rigorous trials. First-line treatment options include topical salicylic acid and cryotherapy, as these agents have the most supporting evidence and similar cure rates. Many patients require several different treatments or a combination of treatments for resolution.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[10]](#psc1054n1014)​[[11]](#refitem-12321101-94EF3275)​[[12]](#psc1054n01032)​[[13]](#refitem-12321152-95ED8552)

Generally, improvement is evident within 1–2 weeks after the initiation of treatment, while resolution may take up to 12 weeks.​[[14]](#psc1054n1011) When home therapy results in increased pain, swelling, bleeding or fever, or improvement is not evident in several weeks, refer the patient to an experienced health-care practitioner for further assessment.​[[14]](#psc1054n1011)

Cure rates with any method of treatment are 25–88%, while up to 78% of plantar warts will undergo spontaneous remission.​[[3]](#2018Witchey29379975)​[[15]](#LooSKTangWY.Wartsnon-genital.BMJCli-1EBB5D81) Cure rates are higher in children and immunocompetent hosts and when the duration of infection is short. They are lower if the wart has failed to respond to any other type of treatment. Mosaic warts are more resistant to treatment than single lesions. Even when treatment appears to have been successful, warts may recur; this may be due to failure to remove tissue in which the virus has caused only latent or subclinical infection.

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Patients should be educated on preparation of the treatment site prior to administering topical treatments using the following steps:

- Wash hands before and after administering treatment and handling the infected area
- Soften the wart by soaking in warm water for 5 minutes
- Gently débride the wart to remove excess keratin, exposing the wart to enhance treatment penetration, by using a disposable emery board or fine abrasive paper
- If using liquid preparations, protect the surrounding skin by applying a thin layer of white petrolatum
- Apply treatment
- Cover the wart after applying treatment (to enhance penetration and reduce transmission)

Patients experiencing pain or discomfort from plantar warts may use moleskin or callous/corn unmedicated pads to relieve pressure points.

**Duct tape** occlusion has been suggested for plantar wart treatment. One small study showed a possible benefit with silver or grey duct tape, this was not seen in further studies that used clear duct tape. There is insufficient evidence to determine efficacy of this treatment.​[[16]](#FochtDR3rdSpicerCFairchokMP.TheEffi-534BB11E)​[[17]](#Abdel-LatifAAEl-SherbinyAFOmarAH.Si-534BBA13)​[[18]](#DeHaenMSpigtMGVanUdenCJEtAl.Efficac-534BBEF0)​[[19]](#WennerRAskariSKChamPMEtAl.DuctTapeF-534BC33E)

### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Foot Care Products: Corns, Calluses and Warts.

[Table 1](#d2e505) describes some preparations available for self-treatment of plantar warts.

Cryotherapy is considered a first-line treatment for plantar warts; nitrous oxide and dimethyl ether and propane (DMEP) are available for purchase without a prescription, while liquid nitrogen is administered in a physician’s office. These are destructive therapies that work by freezing the areas they are applied to, resulting in cell destruction. Liquid nitrogen obtains the lowest temperature followed by nitrous oxide then DMEP. It is postulated that colder temperatures may achieve a higher cure rate, but further study in this area is required. In the self-care setting, cryotherapy is administered once every 2 weeks, and a maximum of 6 applications is recommended. Liquid nitrogen is usually administered by a health-care provider every 2 weeks. More aggressive cryotherapy (increased frequency or longer duration of freezing) appears to be more effective but patients may experience increased adverse events, including pain, blistering and scarring.​​[[10]](#psc1054n1014) Advantages of cryotherapy include less frequent application. Disadvantages include pain, blistering, scarring and post-inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation. Pigmentary changes are more common in darker skin tones. Cryotherapy available for purchase is generally more expensive than salicylic acid treatments; in-office treatment (where available) often has no charge to the patient.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[13]](#refitem-12321152-95ED8552)​[[20]](#WalczukIEertmansFRosselBEtAl.Effica-1EBB1008)

Salicylic acid in concentrations of 17–40% is a destructive therapy and is considered one of the first-line treatments for plantar warts. Higher strengths (40%) may be more efficacious but can cause increased irritation in some patients. Available formulations include liquids, gels, medicated pads and plasters. Plasters/pads come in higher strengths of 40%, must be cut to size, and should be removed and reapplied every second day. Liquids and gels are available in concentrations of up to 30% and should be applied once or twice daily; they allow for more precise application than plasters/pads. Advantages of salicylic acid therapy include low cost and low risk of scarring. Disadvantages include frequency of application, long treatment duration, and side effects of burning and irritation. There is limited evidence that combination therapy of salicylic acid and cryotherapy may be more effective than salicylic acid alone. If this approach is taken, the salicylic acid dose is generally skipped on cryotherapy days to reduce pain and irritation.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[10]](#psc1054n1014)

Topical products containing cantharidin alone or in combination (cantharidin/​podophyllin/​salicylic acid) act as keratolytic and vesicant agents that must be applied by an experienced health-care practitioner. Use of these agents is not recommended in patients with diabetes or impaired peripheral circulation. After application, the lesion is kept occluded for 3–7 days. During this time, a blister forms and the plantar wart becomes necrotic. Treatment with or without curettage may need to be repeated. Adverse effects include pain, swelling and hypo- or hyper-pigmentation. In some patients, pain may interfere with ambulation. In such cases, analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, ASA, ibuprofen or naproxen sodium) may be considered for pain management.

Many supplements, herbals and home remedies have been marketed for wart treatment including apple cider vinegar, banana peel, black cohosh, echinacea, garlic, homeopathy, onion, oregano and tea tree oil. There is insufficient evidence supporting efficacy of any of these agents.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[21]](#TherapeuticResearchCenter.NatMedPro-1EBB146B)

Other treatments with limited evidence for efficacy include oral cimetidine, formic acid, silver nitrate, trichloroacetic acid, oral zinc and zinc oxide ointment. There is not enough evidence to support the routine recommendation of these agents.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[13]](#refitem-12321152-95ED8552)​[[15]](#LooSKTangWY.Wartsnon-genital.BMJCli-1EBB5D81)

### Treatment–resistant plantar warts

Warts that don’t respond to first-line therapies require referral to an experienced health-care professional. There has been limited study on the approach to treatment-resistant warts, but several strategies may be considered; all are off label uses.

Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 5% cream and imiquimod 5% cream used in the treatment of anogenital warts have been used in the treatment of plantar warts. Evidence for these therapies is weak and suggests moderate efficacy, both are associated with significant costs. In-office treatments such as intralesional injection with bleomycin (cytotoxic agent) or immunotherapy agents (such as **candida antigen** or **measles/mumps/rubella vaccine**), **pulse-dye laser therapy** and **photodynamic therapy** have been used with some success, but studies remain limited.​[[2]](#refitem-1232141-89872F7E)​[[12]](#psc1054n01032)​[[13]](#refitem-12321152-95ED8552)​[[15]](#LooSKTangWY.Wartsnon-genital.BMJCli-1EBB5D81)

Some clinicians offer in-office treatment of plantar warts using heat sources such as microwaves or infrared light to raise the temperature of the affected area to approximately 40°C. The course of therapy generally includes 30-minute daily treatments over 3–5 consecutive days with continued maintenance therapy beyond. While the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it is believed to involve tissue destruction and stimulation of an immune response. Evidence supporting these treatments is limited and low quality, with small studies reporting efficacy rates ranging from 35.6–83.3%. Common side effects include local erythema, edema, burning, blistering and pigmentary changes.​[[4]](#2011Mulhem21842775)​[[22]](#LeMConteSHsuJTSEtAl.Energy-basedDev-53BAF03F)​[[23]](#HuoWGaoXHSunXPEtAl.LocalHyperthermi-53BAF3A2)​[[24]](#HagonWHagonJNobleGEtAl.MicrowaveThe-53BAF6BA)

Current HPV vaccines target HPV types responsible for genital warts and certain cancers; they do not target the HPV types that cause common or plantar warts. While case reports have suggested that cutaneous warts may resolve after HPV vaccination, large randomized controlled trials are still lacking.​[[1]](#Matucci-CerinicCHerzumACiccareseGEt-1EB6A150)​[[12]](#psc1054n01032)

### Monitoring of Therapy

The patient should be instructed to monitor the area with each treatment application for wart size, improvement of symptoms (such as pain upon pressure) and signs of secondary bacterial infection (such as redness, swelling, oozing, pain). Some improvement should be seen in 2 weeks with resolution within 12 weeks. Pharmacists can check with the patient every 4 weeks to see if any improvement has been noted and to encourage adherence. If the lesion persists after 12 weeks of self-treatment, or if skin is damaged and becomes painful or inflamed or drains purulent material, refer the patient to an experienced health-care practitioner for additional assessment.

### Advice for the Patient

Advise patients regarding:

- Preparing the area before therapy application
- Covering the wart to prevent transmission to others
- Using the chosen preparation properly
- Preventing and managing adverse effects of treatment
- Knowing when to contact a foot-care specialist
- Not ignoring any lesions or changes in the skin of the foot
