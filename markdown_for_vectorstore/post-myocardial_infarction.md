### Introduction

The term post-myocardial infarction applies to patients who have experienced either ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non–ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). While the early management differs, the long-term therapeutic goals are similar: returning patients to an ideal quality of life and preventing progression of disease and repeat infarction. For details on early management, see Acute Coronary Syndromes.

For patients with STEMI, initial acute reperfusion strategies consisting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy enable restoration of patency to the occluded culprit artery and offer improved prognosis compared to patients treated conservatively.​[[1]](#c0027n00062) Primary PCI, with reperfusion to the culprit artery, should be the first-line therapy if it can be done in an expedient manner. In addition, angiography at primary PCI enables evaluation of the non-culprit arteries and preliminary assessment of left ventricular function. For those receiving thrombolytic therapy, early assessment of reperfusion success is imperative, as transfer for urgent angiography is indicated for failed reperfusion.​[[2]](#c0027n00063)​[[3]](#c0027n00064) Evidence suggests the need for early cardiac catheterization, even among those with successful reperfusion.​[[4]](#c0027n00065) This is especially evident in individuals with large infarcts, where a pharmacoinvasive approach (transfer for angiography immediately after thrombolysis) prevents subsequent recurrent ischemia and infarction and allows early risk stratification.​[[5]](#c0027n00067)​[[6]](#c0027n00068) While STEMI requires more urgent upfront treatment, NSTEMI actually has higher long-term morbidity and mortality.​[[7]](#c0027n00069) Accordingly, the need for risk stratification early after NSTEMI is essential. An “invasive approach” of early angiography with subsequent revascularization with PCI or coronary bypass surgery has been shown to reduce recurrent morbidity and mortality in high-risk NSTEMI patients.​[[8]](#c0027n00356)

### Goals of Therapy

- Evaluate for the presence of complications associated with MI:

  - LV dysfunction (cause of heart failure or arrhythmias)
  - LV clot (cause of stroke or other embolic events)
  - late or nonreperfused MI (cause of mechanical complications, e.g., ventricular septal defects, mitral regurgitation)
- Target modifiable risk factors for secondary prevention
- Restore quality of life and facilitate return to work
- Monitor for potential arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias)

### Investigations

- Determine risk for ongoing ischemia and to prevent future infarction:

  - coronary angiography: evidence supports early angiography for most patients with STEMI and NSTEMI. PCI for non-culprit lesions for patients presenting with STEMI who have multivessel disease prevents cardiovascular death and recurrent myocardial infarction.​[[9]](#MehtaSRWoodDAStoreyRFEtAl.CompleteR-C536154F) For patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, timely coronary angiography should be considered.
  - stress testing: exercise or pharmacologic stress testing can be conducted for lower-risk patients with NSTEMI; coronary angiography should be performed if there is a high-risk test result

- Evaluation of infarct size (or LV function):

  - patients with significantly diminished ejection fraction (EF) are at risk of LV thrombus formation, heart failure and arrhythmia

    - left ventriculography can be conducted at coronary angiogram to provide an early evaluation of LV function
    - echocardiogram, radionuclide imaging or magnetic resonance imaging can also measure infarct size; echocardiogram is the modality of choice to assess presence of LV clot
  - repeat LV function evaluation should be conducted ≥1 month in nonrevascularized patients and ≥3 months in revascularized patients to determine LV recovery and the need for an implantable defibrillator​[[10]](#c0027n00066) (if LVEF <30–35%)
- Evaluate modifiable risk factors:

  - history, particularly of smoking
  - physical examination: blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference
  - blood work: cholesterol and glucose measurements

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Coronary angiography should be considered in most patients after myocardial infarction.
- Target goals for weight management include BMI 18.5–25 and waist circumference <100 cm (male) or <90 cm (female).​[[10]](#c0027n00066) The goal is to sustain a 5–10% decrease in body weight. Nutritional counselling is an important tool for patients attempting to lose weight (see also Obesity).
- Regular exercise (aerobic exercise and resistance training) is encouraged with an individual prescription that accounts for age, obesity, level of fitness and biomechanical capability. Generally, the goal of burning off 1000 kcal/week can be attained by engaging in 30–45 minutes of moderate aerobic activity 3 or 4 times per week.​[[11]](#c0027n00070)
- Individual or group counselling has a role in managing significant psychosocial issues, e.g., anxiety, social support.
- Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in select patients (see [Investigations](#c0027n00049)) with significant residual LV dysfunction despite aggressive medical therapies for 3 or more months.​[[12]](#c0027n00071)

### Pharmacologic Choices

After MI, patients are at substantial risk for subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as nonfatal MI, death or stroke. Secondary prevention with several classes of drugs independently reduces incidence of MACE by approximately 25%​[[13]](#c0027n00313) (see [Table 1](#c0027n00294)). An overview of individual agents is provided in [Table 2](#c0027n00061).

**Table 1:** Individual and Cumulative Impact of 4 Treatments for Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events

| Drug Therapy | Relative Risk Reduction | 2-Year Event Rate(death, MI or stroke) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | — | 8% |
| ASA | 25% | 6% |
| Beta-blocker | 25% | 4.5% |
| Lipid lowering (reduce LDL-C by 1.5 mmol/L) | 30% | 3% |
| ACE inhibitor | 25% | 2.3% |
| Cumulative relative risk reduction if all 4 drugs are used | ≈75% |  |
| To calculate the cumulative risk reduction, a multiplicative scale was used. For example, 2 interventions, each reducing the risk of an event by 30%, would be expected to have about a 50% relative risk reduction (1 – [0.7 × 0.7]). No interactions in treatment effects were observed in trials, suggesting that the proportionate risk reduction of a specific drug in the presence or absence of other effective interventions would be expected to be similar. Smoking cessation lowers the risk of recurrent MI by about half after 2 years. In a smoker with vascular disease, quitting smoking and the use of the 4 preventive strategies could theoretically have a large potential benefit (approximately 80% relative risk reduction). |

### Antiplatelet Agents

Myocardial infarction is a consequence of an acute plaque rupture, in which activated platelets play an integral role. Consequently, after reperfusion therapy, early inhibition of platelets with ASA and an adenosine P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is required to maintain vessel patency and prevent reinfarction.​[[14]](#c0027n00072) Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is also required for prevention of acute occlusion of stents after PCI​[[15]](#c0027n00073)​[[16]](#c0027n00074) or in patients managed medically.​[[17]](#c0027n00472) Long-term antiplatelet therapy is effective in preventing MACE.​[[10]](#c0027n00066) Currently available P2Y12 inhibitory drugs include the thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel) and ticagrelor.

In patients who have received thrombolytic therapy for acute MI, clopidogrel or ticagrelor (if patient <75 y) can be used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA.​[[17]](#c0027n00472)​[[18]](#BerwangerONicolauJCCarvalhoACEtAl.T-B654B03A) For most other infarct patients, the first-line P2Y12 inhibitor is either prasugrel or ticagrelor.​[[19]](#c0027n00080)​[[20]](#c0027n00348)

Irrespective of the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor, the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be at least 1 year after MI in patients with low bleeding risk.​[[21]](#LevineGNBatesERBittlJAEtAl.2016ACCA-C03FF097) Evidence suggests that in some patients, there may benefit from prolonging DAPT post-MI for up to 3 years beyond the first year. In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, cardiovascular benefit was shown from using a ticagrelor dose of 60 mg twice daily.​[[22]](#BonacaMPBhattDLCohenMEtAl.Long-term-6EEDC17B) Data from the DAPT trial also suggests benefit of long-term therapy among higher-risk patients treated with clopidogrel or prasugrel.​[[23]](#MauriLKereiakesDJYehRWEtAl.TwelveOr-6EEDC4DD) The [DAPT Risk Calculator](http://tools.acc.org/DAPTriskapp/#!/content/calculator/) may be used to select patients most likely to benefit from continuation of their P2Y12 inhibitor;​[[24]](#YehRWSecemskyEAKereiakesDJEtAl.Deve-BD9B1385)​[[25]](#KereiakesDJYehRWMassaroJMEtAl.DAPTS-BD9B106F) however, this has to be weighed carefully against bleeding risk. In certain patients, e.g., those at a high risk of bleeding, earlier discontinuation of the P2Y12 inhibitor might be considered in consultation with the cardiologist. For other patients, high-risk anatomical or PCI features may dictate consideration for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy.

Another strategy to consider at 1 year is a combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with low dose aspirin at 81 mg. This combination was shown to be of benefit in the COMPASS study among patients with stable coronary disease.​[[26]](#ConnollySJEikelboomJWBoschJEtAl.Riv-B654B3F9) This may specifically benefit patients also known to have peripheral vascular disease, or those considered at higher risk of stroke rather than MI.

### Acetylsalicylic acid

ASA is the antiplatelet agent of choice for long-term secondary prevention due to its effectiveness and low cost. Indefinite therapy is indicated in all postinfarct patients; low-dose therapy (75–100 mg) is as effective as higher doses (300–325 mg).​[[27]](#c0027n00075) Low-dose ASA is generally better tolerated, with lower bleeding risk.​[[28]](#c0027n00076) ASA is used in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor when indicated (see [Figure 1](#c0027n00478)).

### Clopidogrel

The thienopyridine clopidogrel continues to be commonly used after PCI. In MI patients receiving clopidogrel after PCI, a dose of 150 mg daily for the first 6 days has been shown to be superior and should be considered.​[[17]](#c0027n00472)​[[29]](#c0027n00473) A daily dose of 75 mg should be used after the initial 6 days of high-dose therapy or for those patients deemed not to require the initial high-dose therapy. For patients with ASA allergy, chronic clopidogrel therapy may be a substitute.

### Prasugrel

Prasugrel is a thienopyridine with an active metabolite that binds irreversibly to the P2Y12 receptor. Prasugrel has a faster onset of action with increased potency in platelet inhibition compared to clopidogrel. In patients with MI undergoing PCI, prasugrel reduced MACE (2.2% absolute risk reduction [ARR]) compared to clopidogrel.​[[19]](#c0027n00080) Current guidelines suggest prasugrel or ticagrelor as first-line agents after NSTEMI or STEMI.​[[17]](#c0027n00472)​[[30]](#c0027n00078) Increased bleeding has been associated with prasugrel among patients who are elderly (>75 y), have a history of stroke or TIA, or who have low body weight (<60 kg). Accordingly, guidelines suggest a reduced dose of prasugrel in patients ≥75 years of age or who weigh ≤60 kg.​[[17]](#c0027n00472) Prasugrel should be avoided in patients with previous stroke or TIA.

### Ticagrelor

Ticagrelor, a cyclopentyl triazolopyrimidine, is a direct, reversible inhibitor of the P2Y12 receptor. It is more effective (1.9% ARR in death from vascular causes, MI or stroke) in acute coronary syndrome when compared to clopidogrel.​[[20]](#c0027n00348) Ticagrelor is endorsed as first-line therapy in current guidelines.​[[17]](#c0027n00472)​[[30]](#c0027n00078) Bleeding is increased among patients treated medically or with PCI when compared to clopidogrel.​[[20]](#c0027n00348) Dyspnea may occur in approximately 14% of patients treated with ticagrelor.​[[20]](#c0027n00348)

### Beta-Blockers

In the absence of contraindications, consider this class of medication in all patients after STEMI or NSTEMI, as they have been proven to reduce MACE postinfarct.​[[10]](#c0027n00066)​[[30]](#c0027n00078) In particular, beta-blockers play a role in the reduction of reinfarction and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia in the early phase after infarction.​[[31]](#c0027n00081) Beta-blockers should be started within a few days of infarction and dosage titrated to achieve a heart rate <70 bpm. However, IV beta-blockers should be used cautiously in the early acute phase, as they may contribute to hemodynamic instability in patients suffering large infarcts.​[[31]](#c0027n00081) Avoid beta-blockers in patients with hypotension, bradycardia and active heart failure. Patients with reduced LV function derive significant benefit from beta-blockers, but should be monitored closely, especially in the postinfarction period. This benefit extends to those already treated with ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers can be stopped if side effects are present and if LV function is normal. They should be continued indefinitely in patients with LV dysfunction.

### Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Pathway

### ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors should be considered in all post-MI patients, especially in those with LV dysfunction (LVEF <40%), hypertension or diabetes mellitus.​[[10]](#c0027n00066)​[[30]](#c0027n00078) The relative benefits of ACE inhibitors are greater among those with LV dysfunction, as they play a role in LV remodelling post-MI. Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors reduces cardiovascular death and MI among those with atherosclerosis and multiple risk factors.​[[32]](#c0027n00085) In patients with significant renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, avoid ACE inhibitors.​[[10]](#c0027n00066) Titration to evidence-based dosages (see [Table 2](#c0027n00061)) is important and should be evaluated at follow-up visits.​[[32]](#c0027n00085)​[[33]](#c0027n00408) The development of a dry cough may require some patients to discontinue ACE inhibitors.

### ARBs

ARBs may be used instead of ACE inhibitors in those intolerant of the latter because of cough. In a randomized control study, valsartan demonstrated equivalent benefit to captopril among post-MI patients with heart failure and LV dysfunction.​[[34]](#c0027n00086) Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB increases adverse events and has no evidence of benefit.​[[35]](#c0027n00357)

### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

Consider using a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (aldosterone antagonist) in patients post-MI with significant LV dysfunction (EF ≤40%). Eplerenone, when added to other post-MI evidenced-based therapies, has demonstrated a reduction in mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular events (heart failure, re-infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia).​[[36]](#c0027n00410) Similarly, spironolactone has been proven beneficial in patients with severe LV dysfunction when used in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.​[[37]](#c0027n00411) Comparative data are limited, so choice is based on tolerability and availability. Closely monitor electrolytes, as eplerenone and spironolactone are associated with a risk of hyperkalemia.

### HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

Starting a statin early after MI decreases both early and late adverse events. Guidelines suggest documenting the cholesterol profile within 24 hours of infarction, as LDL cholesterol may be falsely low for up to 4 weeks postinfarction.​[[30]](#c0027n00078)​[[38]](#c0027n00412) Evidence suggests that intensive treatment with higher-dose statins (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 40 mg/day) early after MI confers additional benefits compared with moderate dosages.​[[39]](#c0027n00300) The benefit of statins extends beyond lowering of LDL cholesterol levels alone as they contribute to plaque stabilization by preventing future acute coronary syndromes.​[[40]](#c0027n00299)

Indefinite continuation of statin therapy is integral to the prevention of ischemic events. Following MI, all patients are considered to be in the high-risk group for subsequent events.​[[41]](#c0027n00303) Current Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines advocate a minimum target LDL-C of <1.8 mmol/L.​[[41]](#c0027n00303) Muscle-related intolerance may be confirmed in up to 6% of patients.​[[42]](#c0027n00474) In patients intolerant of statins, alternative cholesterol-lowering agents such as ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered (see Dyslipidemias).

### Oral Anticoagulants

Oral anticoagulants are recommended in post-MI patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or demonstrable LV thrombus (see [Figure 2](#RecommendationsForPatientsWithAtria-FCDA6D0E) and [Figure 3](#RecommendationsForPatientsWithAtria-FCDA719F)).​[[10]](#c0027n00066) Warfarin continues to be the oral anticoagulant of choice for patients with LV thrombus due to lack of evidence with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for this indication. DOACs should be the oral anticoagulant of choice for patients with atrial fibrillation when used with a P2Y12 inhibitor.​[[45]](#GibsonCMRoxanaMehranRBodeCEtAl.Prev-BDA43947)​[[46]](#CannonCPBhattDLOldgrenJEtAl.DualAnt-1740283F)​[[47]](#LopesRDHeizerGAronsonRElAl.Antithro-B65B1897)​[[48]](#VranckxPValgimigliMEckardtLEtAl.Edo-B65B1B7A) In patients requiring a DOAC, consider early discontinuation of ASA, from as early as 1 day and up to 6 months after PCI.​[[49]](#MehtaSRBaineyKRCantorWJEtAl.2018Can-B65EAF3A)

There is a significant increase in bleeding risk when warfarin is used concurrently with dual antiplatelet therapy.​[[30]](#c0027n00078) This is of concern when combining prasugrel or ticagrelor with warfarin as there may be an even higher risk of bleeding compared to clopidogrel.​[[43]](#c0027n00475) Accordingly, most patients receiving warfarin should use clopidogrel as the P2Y12 inhibitory drug. ASA should be discontinued early. Close monitoring of INR in these patients is imperative, with consideration of shorter duration of antiplatelet therapy if indefinite warfarin therapy is indicated. In those treated with warfarin for LV thrombus post-MI, a repeat echocardiography should be performed after 3 months of treatment.​[[10]](#c0027n00066) If the thrombus has resolved, consider discontinuation of warfarin therapy.

For post-myocardial infarction patients with coronary stenting who also have atrial fibrillation, careful consideration must be given to choosing the antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimen. Studies have shown that patients treated with “triple therapy” (ASA, P2Y12 inhibitor, warfarin) are at increased risk of clinically significant bleeding.​[[44]](#DewildeWJOirbansTVerheugtFWEtAl.Use-173FC13F)​[[45]](#GibsonCMRoxanaMehranRBodeCEtAl.Prev-BDA43947)​[[46]](#CannonCPBhattDLOldgrenJEtAl.DualAnt-1740283F)​[[47]](#LopesRDHeizerGAronsonRElAl.Antithro-B65B1897)​[[48]](#VranckxPValgimigliMEckardtLEtAl.Edo-B65B1B7A)

- In PIONEER AF-PCI, 2 strategies using rivaroxaban were evaluated—either rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor for 1, 6 or 12 months. Both strategies demonstrated reduced clinically significant bleeding compared to triple therapy using warfarin.​[[45]](#GibsonCMRoxanaMehranRBodeCEtAl.Prev-BDA43947)
- The RE-DUAL PCI study compared dabigatran (either 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) combined with a P2Y12 inhibitor against triple therapy with warfarin. Both doses of dabigatran showed reduced bleeding compared to triple therapy.​[[46]](#CannonCPBhattDLOldgrenJEtAl.DualAnt-1740283F)
- The AUGUSTUS trial, using a 2x2 factorial design, randomized patients to apixaban (2.5 mg or 5 mg dose) versus warfarin and ASA versus placebo, thereby permitting the evaluation of the impact of each therapy to bleeding. The study showed apixaban reduced major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared to warfarin, and placebo to have reduced bleeding compared to ASA. The study suggests that in patients with atrial fibrillation and recent acute coronary syndromes or PCI, a regimen using apixaban without ASA incurs less bleeding and hospitalization.​[[47]](#LopesRDHeizerGAronsonRElAl.Antithro-B65B1897)
- The ENTRUST trial showed edoxaban to be non-inferior to a vitamin K antagonist containing a triple therapy regimen in reducing bleeding among patients with atrial fibrillation following PCI.​[[48]](#VranckxPValgimigliMEckardtLEtAl.Edo-B65B1B7A)

The AUGUSTUS and ENTRUST trials support the higher dosages of their respective drugs as proven in their atrial fibrillation trials, with only dose reduction based on criteria set forth in the parent studies. Of note, none of the trials were designed to provide definitive conclusions on ischemic outcomes. In fact, the data does not rule out the possibility of increased MI or stent thrombosis in the double regimen of DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor without ASA.​[[48]](#VranckxPValgimigliMEckardtLEtAl.Edo-B65B1B7A)

Guidelines suggest that DOACs might be considered as an alternative to warfarin when an anticoagulant and antiplatelet agent are used together.​[[30]](#c0027n00078)​[[50]](#ValgimigliMBuenoHByrneRAEtAl.2017ES-17405711)​[[51]](#MacleLCairnsJALeblancKEtAl.2016Focu-17412F46) In this situation, consider stopping ASA early (as early as day 1 or up to 6 months after PCI) with clopidogrel continued at the discretion of the treating physician.​[[49]](#MehtaSRBaineyKRCantorWJEtAl.2018Can-B65EAF3A)​[[50]](#ValgimigliMBuenoHByrneRAEtAl.2017ES-17405711) Experience with prasugrel or ticagrelor is limited at this point, so they are best avoided.​[[49]](#MehtaSRBaineyKRCantorWJEtAl.2018Can-B65EAF3A)​[[50]](#ValgimigliMBuenoHByrneRAEtAl.2017ES-17405711) Decision on a regimen should be individualized for each patient after consultation with the treating cardiologists.

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Post-myocardial Infarction and Pregnancy

Myocardial infarction during the peripartum period is rare. However, if MI occurs in the peripartum period, a diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) should be considered as it is the most common cause of MI in pregnancy.​[[52]](#TweetMSHayesSNCodsiEEtAl.Spontaneou-C4CA1E44) Risk factors for SCAD in pregnancy include multiparous, use of infertility therapies and pre-eclampsia.​[[52]](#TweetMSHayesSNCodsiEEtAl.Spontaneou-C4CA1E44) In the largest registry of patients with SCAD, 4.7% of cases occurred during the peripartum period and 2.9% during breastfeeding.​[[53]](#SawJStarovoytovAHumphriesKEtAl.Cana-C4CA2BEE)

### Management

SCAD is diagnosed with angiography, with the majority of these patients managed conservatively with medications rather than PCI or surgery. DAPT may confer some benefit in patients with SCAD, based on the presumed prothrombotic nature of intimal tears.​[[54]](#YipASawJ.SpontaneousCoronaryArteryD-C4CADE4D) Beta-blockers similarly may provide benefit by reduction in shear stress. ACE inhibitors may be considered if there is significant LV dysfunction (≤40%). Statins would not be indicated in patients with SCAD, unless concurrent CAD is documented.

### Post-myocardial Infarction and Breastfeeding

There has been concerning documentation of the onset of SCAD symptoms during lactation;​[[52]](#TweetMSHayesSNCodsiEEtAl.Spontaneou-C4CA1E44) accordingly, continuation of breastfeeding should be done with careful consideration. For those with CAD rather than SCAD as a cause for MI, ASA and beta-blockers can be used at low doses in breastfeeding patients. However, if P2Y12 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors or statins are used, breastfeeding would not be recommended.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Close adherence to evidenced-based therapies is correlated with improved long-term outcomes.​[[55]](#c0027n00305)​[[56]](#c0027n00306) Institution of these therapies early post-MI during initial hospitalization may confer higher adherence rates. Ongoing titration to evidence-based dosages of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors is important (see [Table 2](#c0027n00061)).
- The use of the highest tolerated dose of statins would be preferred among patients post-MI.​[[57]](#GrundySMStoneNJBaileyALEtAl.2018AHA-D2B5C1AC)
- Smoking cessation programs and cardiac rehabilitation referral should be offered early post-MI to all motivated patients. Use of the nicotine replacement strategies bupropion or varenicline can be safely offered in the early post-MI period.​[[10]](#c0027n00066)​[[30]](#c0027n00078)
- Treat blood pressure to a target adjusted according to the presence or absence of other disease states (see Hypertension).
- Initiate hypoglycemic therapy to attain an HbA1c of <7% in most patients (see Diabetes Mellitus). Avoid thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) in post-MI patients because of the risk of worsening heart failure.
- Give sublingual nitrates to all post-MI patients with clear instructions for proper use and response in the setting of recurrent chest discomfort.
- Encourage post-MI patients to receive an annual influenza vaccination.
- Depression is common in post-MI patients. Maintain a high level of awareness for the psychosocial status of patients with inquiries about depression, anxiety, sleep disorder and social support. Treatment with cognitive behaviour therapy or pharmacotherapy may be indicated especially in the first year after MI.​[[10]](#c0027n00066) Use of an SSRI reduces symptoms of depression and may improve cardiovascular outcomes.​[[58]](#c0027n00467)
- Hormone therapy is not indicated and may be harmful for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women.​[[10]](#c0027n00066)
- Routine use of antioxidant vitamins for prevention of cardiovascular events is not recommended.​[[10]](#c0027n00066)
- Celecoxib and some nonselective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may increase atherothrombotic complications. In addition, ibuprofen may reduce the antiplatelet effect of low-dose ASA. Avoid NSAIDs if possible, especially in those with significant LV dysfunction.​[[59]](#c0027n00308) Two meta-analyses suggest that naproxen is the NSAID with the least adverse cardiovascular effects.​[[60]](#c0027n00468)​[[61]](#c0027n00469)

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad913185e1471) A PCI is considered high-risk based on clinical and angiographic features such as diabetes mellitus, prior ACS, chronic renal dysfunction (ClCr <60 mL/min), prior stent thrombosis, current smoker, multivessel disease, multiple stents implanted, complex bifurcation lesion, total stent length >60 mm, chronic total occlusion intervention or bioabsorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) implantation.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd913185e1474) OAC regimens evaluated in this context include rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (10 mg in patients with renal dysfunction), dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg BID and warfarin. If warfarin is to be used, recommended INR target is 2.0–2.5. All patients should receive a loading dose of ASA 160 mg at the time of PCI (if previously ASA naïve). Thereafter, ASA can be discontinued as early as the day following PCI.

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd913185e1477) Extended treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor can be added to ASA if high-risk clinical or angiographic features of ischemic events develop and low risk of bleeding.

[[d]](#fnsrc_figfndd913185e1483) The dose of OAC beyond the initial period of antithrombotic therapy (up to a year after PCI) should be standard stroke prevention doses (see Prevention of Ischemic Stroke). Single antiplatelet therapy with either ASA or clopidogrel may be added to OAC if high-risk or angiographic features of ischemic events develop and low risk of bleeding.

[[a]](#fnsrc_figfnad913185e1561) A PCI is considered high-risk based on clinical and angiographic features such as: diabetes mellitus, prior ACS, chronic renal dysfunction (ClCr <60 mL/min), prior stent thrombosis, current smoker, multi-vessel disease, multiple stents implanted, complex bifurcation lesion, total stent length >60 mm, chronic total occlusion intervention or bioabsorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) implantation.

[[b]](#fnsrc_figfnbd913185e1564) If CHADS2=1 and age <65 another option for initial treatment (especially if high-risk for ischemic events) is DAPT alone using ASA+ticagrelor or ASA+prasugrel, similar to the recommendation for the CHADS2=0 patient

[[c]](#fnsrc_figfncd913185e1573) Ticagrelor and prasugrel are recommended in ACS patients, whereas clopidogrel is recommended for elective PCI.

[[d]](#fnsrc_figfndd913185e1576) Regimens evaluated in the context of triple therapy include rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID or warfarin. if warfarin is to be used, recommended INR target is 2.0-2.5. OAC options evaluated in the context of dual pathway strategy include rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (plus clopidogrel) or dabigatran 110 mg/150 mg BID (plus clopidogrel).

[[e]](#fnsrc_figfned913185e1579) DAPT will have been started as part of ACS management or prior to high risk elective PCI. ASA may be discontinued as early as the day following PCI or can be continued longer term (e.g., 1, 3 or maximum 6 months after PCI). The timing of when to discontinue ASA will vary, depending on the individual patient’s ischemic and bleeding risk.

[[f]](#fnsrc_figfnfd913185e1582) A P2Y12 inhibitor can be added to ASA if high-risk clinical or angiographic features of ischemic events and low risk of bleeding.

[[g]](#fnsrc_figfngd913185e1588) The dose of OAC beyond 1 year after PCI should be standard stroke prevention doses (see Prevention of Ischemic Stroke). Single antiplatelet therapy with either ASA or clopidogrel may be added to OAC if high risk or angiographic features of ischemic events develop and low risk of bleeding.
