### Introduction

Persistent (2–30 days) or intractable (>1 month) hiccups are unusual but distressing. They may cause insomnia, weight loss or depression and may be associated with metabolic causes, upper respiratory tract infections such as COVID-19, and abnormalities of the CNS, ear, throat, diaphragm, thorax or abdomen.​[[1]](#RouseS-F5908048)​[[2]](#covidHiccups) Persistent/intractable hiccups occur predominantly in older males. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients.*)

### Goals of Therapy

- Stop or decrease frequency or intensity of hiccups to improve functional impairments listed above
- Prevent recurrence

### Investigations

- Targeted history (including medication and alcohol use) and physical examination looking for causes of vagus or phrenic nerve irritation, malignancy, CNS, or gastrointestinal disease; if no abnormalities are identified, it is reasonable to perform laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, creatinine) and a chest x-ray​[[3]](#StegerMSchneemannMFoxM.SystemicRevi-998A7514)

  - drug-induced persistent hiccups are uncommon; alcohol, corticosteroids (especially dexamethasone) and benzodiazepines are the drugs most frequently implicated​[[3]](#StegerMSchneemannMFoxM.SystemicRevi-998A7514)​[[4]](#c0117n00012)​[[5]](#dexCaseSeriez)
- Further investigations (e.g., upper GI tract endoscopy, CT thorax-abdomen, abdominal ultrasound) depend on findings from the approach listed above

If all investigations are negative or etiologic treatment is impossible, a therapeutic trial to stop the hiccups is warranted.

### Therapeutic Choices

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Although many techniques may anecdotally improve acute hiccups (e.g., posterior pharyngeal wall stimulation with a finger, forced expiration against a closed glottis for 10 seconds in the sitting position, breath holding, breathing into a paper bag), there is no evidence for these techniques for persistent hiccups.
- If gastric distention is identified as the cause, gastric aspiration is worth trying.
- Poor-quality studies have reported temporary or permanent relief of intractable hiccups with acupuncture, but no randomized, placebo-controlled trials testing this approach have been published.​[[6]](#c0117n00148)
- Continuous cervical epidural block has shown a high success rate when multiple sessions (usually 2–3) are utilized.​[[7]](#KimJE-F590CFB7)
- Phrenic nerve disruption is reserved for cases where all other treatment modalities have failed.​[[8]](#neuroHiccup)

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Table 1](#c0117n00019) details some of the medications and doses used in the management of persistent or intractable hiccups.

There is currently not enough evidence to recommend any single therapy over another, as most studies involve case reports or case series in small numbers of patients; only baclofen and metoclopramide have been studied in randomized controlled trials. Often patients will fail multiple therapies before a successful regimen is found.

If chronic therapy is required, titrate the dose downward to find the lowest effective dose taken once daily.

### Dopamine Antagonists

Historically, chlorpromazine has been tried for the treatment of persistent hiccups.​[[9]](#c0117n00015) Haloperidol has also been effective in some cases.​[[10]](#c0117n00146) Metoclopramide was moderately effective in a small randomized placebo-controlled trial;​[[12]](#WangTWangD.MetoclopramideForPatient-99888D86) it may act as a dopamine antagonist or by enhancing gastric emptying. A protocol for a systematic review of metoclopramide in persistent hiccups was recently published. The results are pending but may provide more robust evidence regarding the use of metoclopramide.​[[11]](#metaMeto)

### Muscle Relaxants

Baclofen has been studied in 2 randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials and found to be more effective than placebo for intractable hiccups.​[[13]](#c0117n00014)​[[14]](#ZhangCZhangRZhangSEtAl.BaclofenForS-998859C3) In a case series, maintenance therapy was required in at least 50% of cases.​[[15]](#c0117n00150) If effective, baclofen should not be discontinued suddenly; taper gradually until the minimum maintenance dose is determined.

Since baclofen is excreted by the kidney, much lower doses are required in the presence of renal failure; neurotoxicity has been reported in patients with renal failure.​[[16]](#ChouCChenCLinSHuangH.Baclofen-induc-99899198)

### Other Drugs

In case reports or case series, many other drugs such as amantadine,​[[17]](#c0117n00138) amitriptyline,​[[18]](#c0117n00139) carbamazepine,​[[19]](#c0117n00140) gabapentin,​[[20]](#c0117n00151) nifedipine​[[21]](#c0117n00142) and valproic acid​[[22]](#c0117n00143) have been found to be effective in some patients.

Avoid benzodiazepines, as worsening of hiccups has been reported.

### Duration of Treatment

With an effective drug, hiccups generally stop abruptly within a few hours; in some cases, the frequency and severity may slowly decrease over days.

When a drug is deemed effective, taper the dose downward after 1–3 days. If hiccups do not return, the drug can be tapered and stopped. If hiccups return, find the lowest dose that will suppress them; maintenance therapy may be required in some cases.

When a drug is ineffective, there is no need to continue treatment for more than 3 days.
