### Assessment Algorithm

Patients may erroneously attribute any perianal symptom to hemorrhoids. In fact, these symptoms may be due to a number of conditions, ranging in severity from poor hygiene to colorectal cancer (see [Table 1](#psc1037n00003)).​[[1]](#psc1037n1006) An assessment plan for patients reporting perianal symptoms is illustrated in [Figure 1](#psc1037n00002).​[[2]](#psc1037n1001)​[[3]](#psc1037n1002)​[[4]](#psc1037n1003)​[[5]](#psc1037n1004)​[[6]](#psc1037n1005) All too often, patients seeking relief with nonprescription agents have delayed consulting a health-care practitioner until the symptoms have become unbearable and the condition has advanced to the point where medical referral is necessary.
