### Introduction

Viral rhinitis, or the common cold, is typically a benign, self-limited viral infection caused by several viruses, most commonly rhinoviruses (30–50%) and coronaviruses (10–15%).​[[1]](#commonCold) Infection by the virus triggers an immune reaction that releases inflammatory mediators that cause the symptoms of viral rhinitis. Typical symptoms include rhinorrhea and nasal congestion; they generally resolve untreated in 10–14 days. These symptoms may cause enough discomfort to lead to absenteeism from work or school. Adults may get 2–3 colds per year while children may get 5–7 per year.​[[2]](#commonerCold) There is no evidence that symptomatic treatment lessens the risk of developing complications such as middle ear effusions, otitis media, sinusitis, asthma exacerbations, or febrile seizures in infants and children.​[[1]](#commonCold)

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent infection
- Lessen interference with activities of daily living
- Reduce the discomfort and emotional distress of rhinorrhea
- Relieve the discomfort of nasal congestion
- Minimize the potential adverse effects of pharmacologic agents
- Prevent person-to-person transmission

### Investigations

- Diagnosis of the common cold requires no specific laboratory investigation. Differential diagnoses include influenza, pneumonia, pandemic coronaviruses (SARS, COVID-19), otitis media, allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and asthma along with croup, bronchiolitis and whooping cough (especially in infants and children).
- History with particular attention to intensity, frequency and severity of symptoms:

  - Early symptoms of a cold include headache, chills, sneezing and sore throat. Later symptoms include nasal discharge, nasal congestion, cough and malaise. Symptoms may last from a few days to 2 weeks. A recent study demonstrated that it may take 3 weeks for 90% of children’s symptoms to resolve.​[[3]](#commonestCold)
  - Symptoms of the flu are more severe than those of colds and typically include abrupt onset of fever, severe myalgias, anorexia, sore throat, headache and cough​[[4]](#AllanGMArrollBPreventionAndTreatme-8E4B0EF9)​[[5]](#c0037n00023) (see Influenza). Symptoms of COVID-19 include those of influenza as well as shortness of breath, chills and anosmia/dysgeusia (see COVID-19); follow local public health quarantine recommendations if suspected.
  - Symptoms of a sinus headache, difficulty breathing or chest pain may suggest bacterial infection (see Acute Rhinosinusitis for more information).

### Therapeutic Choices

Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are available to improve the symptoms of viral rhinitis (pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough) and the patient’s quality of life. Each pharmacologic agent employed should be directed against a specific symptom.

### Prevention

- Avoid close contact with someone who has a cold.
- Limit the risk of inoculation and transmission by adhering to strict hand-washing techniques;​[[4]](#AllanGMArrollBPreventionAndTreatme-8E4B0EF9)​[[5]](#c0037n00023) abstaining from touching eyes or nose; and sneezing or coughing into the elbow or a tissue, which is then discarded immediately.
- Wearing a mask or face covering in public settings may be advised to reduce the spread of infections.​[[6]](#c0037n00116)
- **North American** ginseng extract (COLD-FX or *Panax quinquefolius*; see [Table 1](#c0037n00154)) taken preventatively daily for up to 4 months may reduce the total time with upper respiratory tract symptoms by about 6 days.​[[6]](#c0037n00116)​[[7]](#c0037n00232) GI upset is the main adverse effect. There is insufficient evidence to recommend North American ginseng extract for the *treatment* of viral rhinitis.​[[7]](#c0037n00232) There are no efficacy or safety studies regarding the use of ginseng in children.
- A Cochrane review found that probiotics were better than placebo or no treatment in preventing acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).​[[8]](#CochProbiotic) Most of the high-quality studies included in the Cochrane review involved administration of probiotics for more than 3 months. Probiotics likely reduce both the number of patients diagnosed with multiple URTIs as well as antibiotic prescriptions. In addition, there is lower-certainty evidence that probiotics may reduce the mean URTI duration by 1.22 days.​[[8]](#CochProbiotic) It is important that probiotic safety is monitored over the long term.​[[9]](#probiotLongTerm)

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Maintain usual fluid intake.​[[10]](#c0037n00026)
- Experts recommend rest; however, no studies are available to support this recommendation.
- There is insufficient evidence to support the practice of inhaling steam.​[[11]](#c0037n00034) Advise caution during use to prevent burns, especially in children.​[[12]](#BaartmansM-0D46286A) Vaporizers should be cleaned regularly to prevent contamination.
- There is uncertainty regarding whether exercise reduces occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections.​[[13]](#GrandeA-0D44FCDC)

### Pharmacologic Choices

[Figure 1](#c0037n00001) provides an approach to the symptomatic treatment of viral rhinitis. Dosing information for the medications discussed can be found in [Table 1](#c0037n00154).

### First-Line Therapies

### Analgesics and Antipyretics

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ASA, ibuprofen, naproxen) have not been shown to improve respiratory symptoms associated with the common cold, but may improve pain-related symptoms such as headache, ear pain, or muscle and joint pain in adults.​[[14]](#KimSYxa0ChangYJxa0ChoHMxa0HwangYWxa-8E4BF076)

Acetaminophen is effective at reducing fever but is unlikely to improve other symptoms related to viral rhinitis.​[[15]](#LiSYue-0D46F960)

In children, acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be helpful for treating fever and pain. Ibuprofen is generally not recommended in infants <6 months of age and naproxen is not recommended in children <12 years of age. ASA should not be used in children due to the increased incidence of Reye syndrome associated with its use during influenza virus infections.​[[16]](#c0037n00025)

### Anticholinergic Agents

Intranasal ipratropium blocks cholinergic-mediated vasodilatation. It is effective for rhinorrhea and relief of sneezing, but does not improve nasal congestion in adults and children 5 years of age and older.​[[17]](#c0037n00229) Adverse effects include nasal dryness, blood-tinged mucous and epistaxis.

### Decongestants and Antihistamines

### Decongestants

Decongestants are used to improve nasal air flow by relieving nasal congestion and improving rhinorrhea. There may be a small positive effect on nasal congestion in adults with the common cold who take multiple doses of decongestants.​[[18]](#Deckx-8E4B96EC) There is insufficient evidence to support their use in children <12 years of age. Decongestants are available in oral or intranasal dosage forms.​[[18]](#Deckx-8E4B96EC)

When compared with oral decongestants, topical decongestants were found to have similar efficacy,​[[18]](#Deckx-8E4B96EC) with faster symptom relief and less adverse effects. Thus, they are one of the preferred agents for viral rhinitis in adolescents and adults. Prolonged use (usually >3–5 days) of topical nasal decongestants is associated with rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa); therefore, short-term use (≤3 days) is recommended.​[[19]](#c0037n00120) There are no published trials that evaluate topical nasal decongestants in children.

Oral pseudoephedrine is an effective treatment for nasal congestion in adults.​[[20]](#c0037n00029)​[[21]](#c0037n00030) Multiple doses of pseudoephedrine over a 3-day period are safe.​[[21]](#c0037n00030) Evaluations of the effectiveness of oral phenylephrine have yielded conflicting results.​[[22]](#c0037n00190)​[[23]](#c0037n00191)

### Antihistamines

Antihistamine/decongestant combinations have been shown to improve short-term nasal symptoms in adolescents and adults with viral rhinitis.​[[24]](#c0037n00236) They may be used after topical treatments have failed.

In general, antihistamines (both sedating and nonsedating) as monotherapy do not significantly improve symptoms or recovery time.​[[2]](#commonerCold) The anticholinergic effects of some first-generation (sedating) antihistamines may briefly reduce nasal secretions,​[[24]](#c0037n00236) but sedation is a common adverse effect.​[[26]](#allergyReference)

### Antihistamine and/or Decongestant Use in Children

Studies examining the use of antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combinations in children <6 years of age have failed to show benefit.​[[28]](#c0037n00168)​[[29]](#c0037n00119) In addition, accidental ingestion and dosing errors with these products can do much harm. Therefore, these agents should be avoided in children <6 years of age.​[[30]](#HC_Kids)

There have been few trials in school-aged children (≥6 y of age). Antihistamine/decongestant combinations may be of benefit, but risks of treatment should carefully be considered.​[[25]](#c0037n00110)

### Therapeutic Alternatives

### Saline Nasal Irrigation

Nasal irrigation with **saline** (0.9 % NaCl) may offer some relief of the symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., reduced nasal secretion and congestion, reduced need for decongestants) in children and adults.​[[31]](#KingDxa0MitchellBxa0WilliamsCPxa0Sp-8E4C3B95)

Breast- or bottle-fed infants who are obligate nose breathers may benefit from regular administration of **normal saline drops**, which aid in cleaning the nose and may improve mucociliary clearance in young infants.​[[16]](#c0037n00025)

### Honey

Honey has demulcent effects, which may reduce cough. Its role is unclear due to conflicting evidence. Some evidence does support subjective improvements in cough frequency and severity in addition to sleep quality of children and adults.​[[33]](#OduwoleO-DDEFF740)​[[34]](#honeY) Much of the evidence is of insufficient size or quality to provide a clear recommendation. For patients who wish to try honey, one teaspoonful (5 mL) at bedtime is the accepted dose. Avoid honey in infants <12 months of age due to the risk of infantile botulism.

### Zinc Lozenges

A meta-analysis of 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in adults demonstrated that the use of zinc lozenges shortened the average duration of the common cold by just under 3 days.​[[35]](#Hemilxe4HPetrusEJFitzgeraldJTEtAlZ-90DD5DA6) It is difficult to make recommendations with respect to dose and duration. Zinc has an unpleasant taste and may cause nausea.

### Therapies with Insufficient Evidence

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the following agents in the treatment of viral rhinitis:

- Antibiotics:​[[36]](#c0037n00117) Gastrointestinal adverse effects are significantly increased in adults who take antibiotics for their colds.​[[36]](#c0037n00117) In addition, their use may contribute to antibiotic resistance in the community. Thus, antibiotics are *not* recommended for treatment of the common cold.
- Antitussives (e.g., codeine, dextromethorphan) and expectorants (e.g., guaifenesin):​[[37]](#c0037n00231) In addition to antitussives not being recommended for treatment of the common cold, Health Canada states they should not be used in children <6 years of age due to the limited evidence of effectiveness, reports of misuse/overdose and rare adverse effects.​[[38]](#c0037n00218)​[[39]](#c0037n00219) Health Canada also recommends that children and youth (≤18 y) not use cough and cold products containing opioids (e.g., codeine).​[[40]](#hc_opioid)
- Intranasal corticosteroids.​[[41]](#c0037n00235)
- Natural health products such as:

  - Chinese herbal medicines​[[42]](#c0037n00209)
  - *Echinacea*​[[43]](#c0037n00237)
  - Garlic​[[44]](#c0037n00207)
  - North American ginseng extract (COLD-FX or *Panax quinquefolius*) for *treatment* of viral rhinitis​[[7]](#c0037n00232)
  - Topical menthol, as monotherapy​[[46]](#c0037n00240)​[[47]](#c0037n00169) or in combination with camphor and eucalyptus.​[[48]](#c0037n00222)​[[49]](#c0037n00192) Menthol and camphor rubs should not be used in children <2 years of age; camphor-containing products can pose a risk of toxicity in children when used inappropriately.​[[50]](#c0037n00223) Due to concerns of increased production and decreased clearance of mucus potentially leading to respiratory distress in children, menthol and camphor rubs should never be placed directly under or in the nostrils​[[49]](#c0037n00192)
  - Vitamin C​[[51]](#c0037n00210)
  - Vitamin D​[[52]](#c0037n00243)​[[53]](#c0037n00242)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Fever associated with the common cold or influenza during pregnancy may be a risk factor for birth defects​[[55]](#c0037n00173) (see Fever).

### Management during Pregnancy

Few trials have studied the effects of viral rhinitis treatment during pregnancy. First-generation antihistamines, including brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine, are considered safe.​[[56]](#SetoAEinarsonTKorenGEvaluationOfBr-F031C30B)​[[57]](#c0037n00174)​[[58]](#AseltonPJickHMilunskyAEtAlFirst-tr-F031F2CD) Due to conflicting reports of possible malformations with first-trimester use of oral decongestants (**phenylephrine**, **pseudoephedrine**),​[[58]](#AseltonPJickHMilunskyAEtAlFirst-tr-F031F2CD)​[[59]](#WerlerMMMitchellAAShapiroSFirstTri-F0328E8B)​[[60]](#TorfsCPKatzEABatesonTFEtAlMaternal-F032B068)​[[61]](#ZierlerSRothmanKJCongenitalHeartDi-F032F53D)​[[62]](#Kxe4llxe9nBAOlaussonOPUseOfOralDec-F032F826) more evidence is required before a clear recommendation can be made regarding their use during the first trimester.

Although data are limited and conflicting,​[[63]](#RayburnWFAndersonJCSmithCVAppelLLDa-F033FFE5)​[[64]](#BaxiLVGindoffPRPregenzerGJEtAlFeta-F03401A0) oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are considered safe during pregnancy for short-term use (≤3 days).​[[54]](#c0037n00172)​[[65]](#FerreiraEMartinBMorinCGrossesseEtA-F0336148) The extent of systemic absorption of nasally administered topical decongestants is unknown​[[54]](#c0037n00172) and systemic side effects, such as hypertension, respiratory depression and sedation, have been reported with the use of xylometazoline nasal spray.​[[66]](#CPSOnlineCPhAMonographXylometazoli-F03404B1) There are no published data regarding the use of **anticholinergics** during pregnancy for patients with asthma or rhinitis.​[[67]](#c0037n00182)

The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C increases in pregnancy to 80–85 mg/day, and adequate intake is an important consideration.​[[68]](#c0037n00244) However, a higher incidence of intrauterine growth restriction was observed in pregnant patients taking **vitamin C** (1 g) in combination with **vitamin E** (400 units) in a study designed to evaluate their role in prevention of pre-eclampsia.​[[69]](#c0037n00177)​[[70]](#c0037n00178) This brings into question the safety of high doses of vitamin C in pregnancy; therefore, its use is not recommended for this self-limiting condition. The safety of ***Echinacea*** use during pregnancy has not been established.​[[71]](#c0037n00179)​[[72]](#c0037n00181) The active component of **ginseng**, ginsenoside Rb1, was teratogenic in animal studies; therefore, caution is advised in pregnancy.​[[73]](#c0037n00180) There are no published studies of **zinc** therapy for viral rhinitis during pregnancy.

### Management during Breastfeeding

In the breastfeeding patient, intranasal saline and topical decongestants (oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) are preferred over decongestants.

The use of honey is considered safe for breastfeeding patients by experts and there is no risk in passing botulism toxin to the breastfeeding child.​[[74]](#caliHoney)

The use of first-generation antihistamines (e.g., brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) and decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine​[[75]](#ItoSBlajchmanAStephensonMEtAlProsp-B883AAC3)​[[76]](#AljazafKHaleTWIlettKFEtAlPseudoeph-B883A7A5)) are considered generally safe in breastfeeding; however, adverse effects are possible in the infant, e.g., drowsiness, irritability. These agents, especially when used in combination, may also reduce serum prolactin in the nursing patient, thus reducing milk supply. If these agents are used, the lowest effective dose and duration should be selected. Discontinue use if a decrease in breast milk production is observed.​[[77]](#Lactmed)

Caution is advised with *Echinacea* and ginseng during breastfeeding due to insufficient data.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Hand hygiene and cough hygiene (coughing into the elbow or a tissue that is discarded) are key to reducing the spread of viral rhinitis.
- The incubation period varies based on the virus (rhinovirus 1–2 days, coronavirus 3–4 days [but varies by strain], adenovirus 5 days);​[[78]](#Lessler-0D4D25A1) virus shedding coincides with the onset of illness or may begin shortly before symptoms develop.

**Drug Class: Antitussives**

| honey < $10 | Adults: 15 mL daily to TID Children 1–18 y: 2.5–10 mL HS. Some experts recommend diluting honey in warm water then having an adult taste test for temperature to avoid scalding the child | Side effects are rare; nervousness, insomnia, hyperactivity. |  | Use only pasteurized honey due to the risk of botulism. Due to this risk, avoid in children <1 y of age, patients who are immunocompromised or those who have structural abnormalities of the GI tract. Avoid in patients allergic to pollen. Do not use honey made from Rhododendron (e.g., R. ponticum , R. flavum , R. luteum ) due to risk of grayanotoxin, which is poisonous. |
