### Introduction

Sweat production is essential for regulating body temperature. It increases in response to a rise in body temperature in order to cool the body.​[[1]](#psc1161n1001) Body temperature is regulated through the hypothalamus, which monitors core and external temperature through body and skin receptors.​[[2]](#SchickCH-2D13339A) Failure of this regulating system to reduce body heat can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, hyperthermia and, in extreme cases, death.​[[3]](#psc1161n01025)

Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) is classified as primary/idiopathic (unknown cause) or secondary (due to an underlying medical condition or medication). It can also be characterized as focal (specific to 1 area) or generalized (all over the body). Hyperhidrosis is a condition in which sweat production exceeds that needed for thermoregulation; it is most commonly chronic and primary. Both primary and secondary hyperhidrosis can severely affect an individual’s quality of life by leading to impairments in social interactions and decreased productivity in the workplace.​[[4]](#Lenefsky-90F9EA50)​[[5]](#Sammons-4D89713F) Mental and emotional health can also be affected: low self-esteem and increased incidence of anxiety and depression have been reported.​[[6]](#BaharRZhouPLiuYEtAl.ThePrevalenceOf-4614FC25)​[[7]](#LenefskyMRiceZP.HyperhydrosisAndIts-46152C20)

Bromhidrosis (or osmidrosis) is a chronic condition involving sweat that has an offensive odour, while chromhidrosis is a condition where sweat is coloured.

### Pathophysiology

Sweat glands consist of a secretory coil in the dermis and a duct that transports sweat to the skin surface (see [Figure 1](#psc1161n00006)). There are 2 main types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. There may be a third type, called apoeccrine, but their existence remains controversial.​[[3]](#psc1161n01025)​[[8]](#BovellDLCorbettADHolmesSEtAl.TheAbs-C4AB003B)​[[9]](#BovellDLMacDonaldAMeyerBAEtAl.TheSe-C4AB5B7E)​[[10]](#HuY-2D140794) [Table 1](#TableGland) discusses the characteristics of each gland type.

**Table 1:** Characteristics of Sweat Glands and Their Secretions​[[3]](#psc1161n01025)[[8]](#BovellDLCorbettADHolmesSEtAl.TheAbs-C4AB003B)[[9]](#BovellDLMacDonaldAMeyerBAEtAl.TheSe-C4AB5B7E)[[10]](#HuY-2D140794)[[11]](#BakerLB.PhysiologyOfSweatGlandFunct-AB0EEDA4)

| Gland | Location and Characteristics | Timing of Development | Characteristics of Secretions | Function of Secretions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eccrine glands | Cover most of the body, with the greatest number on the palms, soles, face, head, limbs and trunk. Open directly onto the skin surface. | Become functional around 2–3 y of age. | Odourless and primarily hypotonic, which conserves electrolytes during excessive sweating. | Primarily responsible for thermoregulation. |
| Apocrine glands | Primarily found in the axillary (underarm), areolar (nipple) and anogenital areas. Larger than eccrine glands; open into hair follicles. | Become functional at the time of puberty. | Milky, viscid and odourless, containing fatty substances that develop an odour once they come in contact with bacteria on the surface of the skin. | Primarily responsible for scent and body odour. |
| Apoeccrine glands | Located in the axillary area. Intermediate sweat glands with structural features of both eccrine and apocrine glands. Open directly onto the skin surface. | Thought to develop in the axillary area at puberty. | Watery and odourless. | Unknown. |

Physiologic sweating is a natural reaction to thermal and emotional stimuli:

- Hot environments, excess clothing and exercise all trigger the hypothalamic centre to increase heat loss through cutaneous vasodilation and generalized sweat production, especially on the face and trunk.
- Sweating around the lips and forehead is a physiologic response to eating hot or spicy foods.
- Emotional stimuli such as anxiety, embarrassment, fear, anger, excitement or mental stress can cause sweating from the palms, soles, underarms and forehead.

Primary hyperhidrosis is estimated to affect about 0.5–4% of the general population and can occur at any age. A family history is present in up to 65% of cases, demonstrating a genetic component.​[[12]](#HenningMAPedersenOBJemecGBEtAl.Gene-BF8DC2C1) The axillae are the most commonly affected area (73%) followed by the palms (46%), soles (41%), scalp (23%) and groin (9%).​[[13]](#LearWKesslerESolishN.EtAl.AnEpidemi-99A512FD) Children generally present with palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, whereas axillary hyperhidrosis is more common after the onset of puberty. Hyperhidrosis is uncommon in the elderly.​[[14]](#BensonRAPalinRHoltPJE.EtAl.Diagnosi-99A4A94A)​[[15]](#SinghSDavisHWilsonP.AxillaryHyperhi-99AE0552)​[[16]](#psc1161n01030) Primary hyperhidrosis is not usually associated with odour, but sweating can be excessive to the point of affecting a person’s quality of life (e.g., cold sweat dripping off the hands or face; clothing becoming wet, leading to an increased risk of infection due to the constant dampness in a concentrated area of the skin).​[[4]](#Lenefsky-90F9EA50) Primary hyperhidrosis is thought to be related to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system whereby excessive acetylcholine is released from the nerve endings; the size and number of eccrine glands do not vary between patients with or without the condition.​[[17]](#HuY-90FD0BF4)​[[18]](#BrackenrichJFaggC.Hyperhydrosis.Sta-46144F86)

Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying condition or as an adverse effect of a medication or procedure (see [Table 2](#SecondaryHH)). It can be focal (limited to one specific body area) or generalized in nature, and occurs during the day or at night (“night sweats”). Generalized secondary hyperhidrosis requires a detailed patient history and work-up.

**Table 2:** Causes of Secondary Hyperhidrosis​[[1]](#psc1161n1001)[[15]](#SinghSDavisHWilsonP.AxillaryHyperhi-99AE0552)[[18]](#BrackenrichJFaggC.Hyperhydrosis.Sta-46144F86)[[19]](#McConaghyJRFosselmanD.Hyperhydrosis-461482D3)[[20]](#psc1161n01031)[[21]](#Cheshire-2D20B521)

| Medical Conditions | Medications |
| --- | --- |
| Hypothalamic disorders, e.g., infection, tumors Endocrine or metabolic disorders, e.g., hyperthyroidism, diabetes, menopause Vasomotor disorders Neurologic disorders, e.g., spinal cord injuries, Parkinson disease Cardiovascular disorders, e.g., heart failure Psychiatric disorders, e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder Obesity Respiratory failure Withdrawal from drugs (e.g., cocaine, opioids) or alcohol | Acetaminophen Antidepressants, e.g., bupropion, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Antipsychotics, e.g., clozapine Cholinergic agents, e.g., bethanechol, pilocarpine Hypoglycemic agents, e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones Hormonal agents, e.g., selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) Opioids, e.g., morphine, methadone Others: infliximab, niacin, sildenafil |

Bromhidrosis (or osmidrosis) is a chronic condition involving apocrine or eccrine sweat, which has an offensive odour and leads to a negative effect on quality of life. Body odour is generally produced by the bacterial degradation of odourless apocrine sweat into ammonia and odoriferous, volatile short-chain fatty acids. Sweat from the eccrine glands is also usually odourless, although occasionally excretion in sweat of certain chemicals from fish, garlic and onions can produce an odour, as can bacterial degradation of keratin secondary to maceration of the stratum corneum (e.g., if footwear does not allow air to circulate, excessive sweating and growth of bacteria may occur, leading to foot odour).​[[22]](#Semkova-3042CE57) Heritable metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease may also cause bromhidrosis due to abnormal secretion of amino acids and their breakdown products in sweat. Predisposing factors for bromhidrosis include hyperhidrosis, obesity and poor body hygiene.​[[1]](#psc1161n1001)​[[5]](#Sammons-4D89713F)

### Goals of Therapy

- Control underarm wetness resulting from normal, physiologic sweating
- Reduce excessive sweating in hyperhidrosis to a tolerable level that permits participation in work and social situations
- Prevent complications of hyperhidrosis involving the feet—odour, blisters and skin infections
- Control socially undesirable body odour in bromhidrosis

### Patient Assessment

Concerns about body odour and underarm wetness resulting from normal, physiologic sweating can often be managed with self-treatment using antiperspirants. However, patients with excessive sweating that has not been controlled with regular use of antiperspirants, increased sweating of recent onset in adults, or sweating that occurs in an unusual pattern with no explanation should be assessed. Further investigation may be necessary to identify possible medical conditions or medications as the cause (i.e., secondary hyperhidrosis; see [Pathophysiology](#psc1161n00001)).

Criteria for diagnosing primary hyperhidrosis includes the following:​[[19]](#McConaghyJRFosselmanD.Hyperhydrosis-461482D3)

- Focal, visible excessive sweating
- Present for at least 6 months
- No apparent secondary causes
- At least 2 of the following:

  - bilateral and symmetric sweating
  - impairment of activities of daily living
  - occurrence at least once weekly
  - age of onset <25 years
  - positive family history
  - absence of sweating during sleep

The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS; see [Table 3](#HDSS)) is a validated, single question survey that may be used to assess severity by determining the tolerability of symptoms and their impact on the patient’s quality of life.​[[23]](#Solish-2DAD373F)

**Table 3:** Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale​[[23]](#Solish-2DAD373F)

| Criteria | Points | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sweating is not noticeable and does not interfere with daily activities. | 1 | Mild–moderate |
| Sweating is tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities. | 2 | Mild–moderate |
| Sweating is barely tolerable and often interferes with daily activities. | 3 | Severe |
| Sweating is intolerable and always interferes with daily activities. | 4 | Severe |

Focal hyperhidrosis does not usually require additional testing for diagnosis but there are several tests (e.g., starch-iodine, quinizarin) that are used in research settings. In clinical practice, they are rarely used; however, the Minor starch-iodine test is used to determine specific areas of hyperhidrosis when administering botulinum toxin.​[[19]](#McConaghyJRFosselmanD.Hyperhydrosis-461482D3) If deemed necessary, sweat production tests can be repeated after several weeks to identify areas of improvement and areas that need further treatment.​[[24]](#psc1161n1005)

An assessment plan for patients with excessive perspiration-related concerns is presented in [Figure 2](#psc1161n01009).

### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Ensure investigation for, and/or treatment of, any underlying condition that may be causing secondary hyperhidrosis or bromhidrosis (e.g., systemic disorders, medications) while implementing the following nonpharmacologic measures, as appropriate.

- **General measures:**

  - Wear clothing that is cool, porous and made from natural fibres that are more breathable than synthetics, particularly in the underarm area. Wash clothing in hot water to remove body odour before wearing again.
  - Use underarm shields, which act as barriers and absorb sweat, preventing wetness from staining clothing.
  - Minimize/avoid triggers, e.g., spicy foods, alcohol, exercising in hot weather, stressful situations that may trigger strong emotions.​[[14]](#BensonRAPalinRHoltPJE.EtAl.Diagnosi-99A4A94A)
  - Reduce/eliminate odour-promoting compounds (e.g., alcohol, curry, garlic, onions), as this may be beneficial for generalized body odour.
- **Personal hygiene:**

  - A regular bath or shower using soap and water will help to prevent buildup of bacteria, sweat and dead skin cells that interact to produce body odour. A daily bath or shower may be necessary for some people.
  - When a full bath or shower is not possible, sponging in the underarm and genital areas can help control the major sources of body odour.
  - Hair removal from the armpits can reduce the propagation of body odour by reducing the surface area for bacterial action.​[[22]](#Semkova-3042CE57)
  - If underarm skin is irritated, avoid soap products that cause further irritation and use unscented cleansers instead.
- **Foot care:** important for patients with excessive foot sweating (plantar hyperhidrosis) and/or odour.​[[25]](#VlahovicTC.PlantarHyperhydrosisAnOv-5370B5BC)

  - Feet should be washed regularly with a skin cleanser and dried thoroughly. For odour control, daily washing may be needed, followed by application of an absorbent foot powder twice a day.
  - Nonocclusive footwear made of natural materials are recommended (e.g., leather shoes that do not have plastic linings, mesh-type running shoes or sandals).
  - Alternating different pairs of shoes each day will allow them to dry thoroughly.
  - Footwear should be worn with socks made of cotton or fibres that are designed to wick away moisture.
  - Socks should be changed twice daily to ensure the feet remain dry and are not at risk of fungal infections (see Athlete's Foot).

Water and electrolytes lost through excessive sweating should be replaced regularly. Monitor for symptoms of dehydration (e.g., lightheadedness, dry mouth/lips, fatigue, excessive thirst, sunken eyes).

### Pharmacologic Therapy

[Figure 2](#psc1161n01009) presents an approach to the management of primary hyperhidrosis, including prescription and nonprescription pharmacologic therapies as well as surgical and alternative modalities. The treatment of body odour primarily involves personal hygiene measures, treatment of contributing skin conditions, and topical antiperspirants as described below and in [Table 5](#d2e594).

Note: for the management of secondary hyperhidrosis, treatment/removal of the underlying cause is the primary method of treatment.

### Topical Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Antiperspirant and Deodorant Products.

#### Antiperspirants

First-line treatment in the management of both perspiration and body odour in most cases is daily use of antiperspirants as part of a personal hygiene regimen (see [Table 5](#d2e594)).

**Antiperspirants** reduce sweating by mechanically obstructing the sweat gland ducts. Sweat production raises the pH in the gland, which causes precipitation of the aluminum salt in the antiperspirant, which then causes the sweat to thicken, clump and plug the duct. Once plugged, the sweat gland ducts receive a signal to reduce or stop perspiration, and this effect can last for 24 hours or longer.​[[1]](#psc1161n1001)​[[26]](#Nawrocki) The effect wears off during the usual epidermal renewal process; however, long-term use of aluminum salts may lead to destruction of the eccrine glands, leading to decreased sweating over time.​[[27]](#BrancaccioGSitoG.TherapiesOfHyperhy-54F4E030)​[[28]](#Holzle-4FF4E4E) Antiperspirants are most commonly used for axillary sweating but can also be applied to any problematic body area (hands, feet, face, back, chest, groin). Irritation may be more common in more sensitive areas.​[[29]](#PariserDMBallardA.TopicalTherapiesI-9BA2CA6A) Skin irritation is the most common side effect and may be caused by the active ingredient (especially if applied to moist skin)​[[30]](#GrabellDAHebertAA.CurrentAndEmergin-54F5DB02) or by perfumes or preservatives used as additives.

Most standard commercial antiperspirant products contain partially neutralized **aluminum salts** (e.g., aluminum zirconium, aluminum sesquichlorohydrate), which create superficial duct blockages that last for ≥24 hours but do not cause irritation with once or twice daily use for most patients. If standard products are not effective after a trial of 1-2 weeks, “clinical strength” versions of the same salt can be tried.​[[26]](#Nawrocki)

The most effective antiperspirants contain aluminum chloride hexahydrate (possibly shortened to aluminum chloride on labels); these should be utilized if standard or “clinical strength” products are inadequate (see [Table 5](#d2e594)). These products are more effective, as they create deeper and more effective duct blockages, but they are also more irritating, as aluminum chloride reacts with water or sweat to form hydrochloric acid, thereby requiring precise adherence to application instructions. Clinical effectiveness is noted after 1–2 weeks of correct application.

Tips for effective use of antiperspirants:​[[29]](#PariserDMBallardA.TopicalTherapiesI-9BA2CA6A)​[[31]](#InternationalHyperhidrosisSociety.A-9BBD820C)​[[32]](#GregoriouSSidiropoulouPKontochristo-B4D535E7)

- All antiperspirants are more effective if applied at bedtime when sweat glands are less active. More active ingredient can enter the sweat duct and create better plugs.
- Showering the morning after nighttime application of antiperspirants will not reduce their effectiveness, as the plug has already formed in the sweat gland below the level of the skin.
- Effectiveness of antiperspirants is improved if the skin is dried completely; using a cool blow dryer for 10 seconds before application and for another 10 seconds after application to thoroughly dry the product is recommended.
- Continuous use of antiperspirants may allow for less frequent application over time. Some patients using aluminum chloride hexahydrate products find initial application every 24–48 hours may be gradually reduced to once every 1–3 weeks while still maintaining effectiveness.
- Irritation can be minimized or avoided by:
  - making sure the skin is completely dry before application; this is especially important before application of aluminum chloride products, as hydrochloric acid is produced when aluminum chloride mixes with water/sweat
  - washing off aluminum chloride hexahydrate products the morning after application so that any product remaining on the surface of the skin is removed; this reduces the risk of irritation due to the production of hydrochloric acid from the reaction between aluminum chloride and any sweat that may be produced during the day
  - waiting 24–48 hours after shaving before applying aluminum chloride hexahydrate products to the shaved skin; this is usually not necessary with standard-strength products (e.g., aluminum zirconium complexes)
  - switching to a product that has a salicylic acid in hydroalcoholic gel base (e.g., Hydrosal), if available​[[29]](#PariserDMBallardA.TopicalTherapiesI-9BA2CA6A)
  - using topical hydrocortisone 1% cream in the short term to treat any irritation that occurs despite appropriate application
- There is conflicting evidence regarding whether occluding the skin (e.g., with plastic wrap) while using antiperspirants increases efficacy and/or irritation.​[[33]](#ShelleyWBHurleyHJ.StudiesOnTopicalA-C025F3B2)​[[34]](#ScholesKTCrowKDEllisJPEtAl.Axillary-C026261D) Some sources recommend trying occlusion if correct application of aluminum chloride hexahydrate products is not effective and did not cause irritation.​[[35]](#InternationalHyperhydrosisSociety.A-C0A4BE4F)
- To minimize yellow-white staining of clothing, apply the antiperspirant in a single thin layer and wait for it to dry before dressing.

There is no evidence of any connection between use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants and Alzheimer disease (or any other dementias) or breast cancer.​[[30]](#GrabellDAHebertAA.CurrentAndEmergin-54F5DB02)​[[36]](#psc1161n1007)​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)

#### Other Topical Therapies

Deodorants, as opposed to antiperspirants, do not prevent sweating but instead mask body odour with fragrance or by reducing the bacterial population in the area. Deodorants may contain nonantiperspirant aluminum- or zinc-containing compounds, which have antibacterial action. Others contain mixtures of fragrant herbs and botanicals. Most aluminum-free products are strictly deodorants, though some contain substances that manufacturers claim block wetness by absorbing sweat or decreasing sweat production or secretion. There is no evidence of effectiveness for these products. Alum has been used traditionally as a water purifier; “natural” or “crystal” deodorants usually contain potassium alum or ammonium alum crystals, which are sulfates of aluminum and are therefore not “aluminum-free.” Antiperspirants with fragrance are available and so the simultaneous use of separate antiperspirant and deodorant is unnecessary.

Glycopyrrolate is safe and effective when used topically for craniofacial​[[38]](#HyunMYSonIPLeeY.EfficacyAndSafetyOf-9CC082A6)​[[39]](#KimWOKilHKYoonDMEtAl.TreatmentOfCom-9CC1B7AF)​[[40]](#KimWOKilHKYoonKBEtAl.TopicalGlycopy-9CC2017C) and axillary hyperhidrosis; it is considered a first-line treatment.​[[41]](#PariserDMHebertAADrewJEtAl.TopicalG-550591F0) Topical pads impregnated with glycopyrrolate are available commercially (see [Table 5](#d2e594)).

Personal hygiene measures (e.g., antimicrobial and antiseptic soaps/washes) are often recommended for bromhidrosis based on expert opinion to reduce bacterial colonization of the skin.​[[42]](#SweatHelpBrom) When other therapies and measures have failed, topical antibiotics such as benzoyl peroxide washes or topical erythromycin or clindamycin may be utilized.​[[22]](#Semkova-3042CE57)

Products used to control foot odour contain combinations of zinc oxide, **sodium bicarbonate**, **corn starch**, **aluminum** and **alcohol**. However, corn starch should be avoided as there is a concern it may be a food source for yeast.​[[43]](#Sibbald-30429FC7)

Astringents like formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methenamine and tannic acid were once used to treat hyperhidrosis by plugging the pores. These chemicals are no longer used because of contact sensitivity and white-brown skin discoloration.​[[27]](#BrancaccioGSitoG.TherapiesOfHyperhy-54F4E030)

### Localized Therapy

**Botulinum toxins** block the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons in eccrine glands, which is beneficial in the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

OnabotulinumtoxinA is used as first-line treatment for moderate to severe primary hyperhidrosis of the axillae or for milder cases when topical treatment has failed after 1 month of continuous treatment. In one study, compared to placebo, 75% of patients reported a 2-point improvement on HDSS.​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0) It is approved only for treatment of primary hyperhidrosis of the axillae, but it has also been used clinically on the palms, soles, face and groin.​[[44]](#WeinbergTSolishN.BotulinumNeurotoxi-9C22D3E1)​[[45]](#GlaserDAGalperinTA.BotulinumToxinFo-9C2336D1) The procedure consists of several injections (average of 10–15 per axilla) and the effects last from 6–9 months,​[[19]](#McConaghyJRFosselmanD.Hyperhydrosis-461482D3)​[[46]](#Belin-3040A3BF) after which, treatment is repeated. Sweat reduction should be noticed after 2–4 days and should be significant after 2 weeks.​[[47]](#psc1161n1008) It is expensive and may be painful; topical anesthetics, ice and dilution with lidocaine may help reduce the pain, if needed.​[[30]](#GrabellDAHebertAA.CurrentAndEmergin-54F5DB02) Use of onabotulinumtoxinA is not recommended in pregnancy, in breastfeeding or in patients with neuromuscular disorders.

AbobotulinumtoxinA is not approved for hyperhidrosis but is effective and commonly recommended for axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis. The procedure is similar to that of onabotulinumtoxinA (average of 5-20 injections per axilla with effects lasting 6–12 months, or 6–30 injections per palm with effects lasting 6.25 months).​[[48]](#Galadari2021)

Other botulinum toxins available in Canada (incobotulinumtoxinA, prabotulinumtoxinA) are not approved for treatment of hyperhidrosis; some have been shown to have efficacy, but further studies are needed.

### Systemic Therapy

Evidence has shown effectiveness of the oral anticholinergics glycopyrrolate and oxybutynin but adverse effects limit their use.​[[26]](#Nawrocki) In a systematic review, oxybutynin therapy was shown to improve symptoms of hyperhidrosis in 76.2% of patients as well as improve quality of life in 75.6% of patients.​[[49]](#CruddasLBakerDM.TreatmentOfPrimaryH-5502BAAC) They may be useful in patients with multifocal primary hyperhidrosis, compensatory hyperhidrosis (e.g., following surgery), and in those with severe symptoms for whom topical treatments, iontophoresis and onabotulinumtoxinA (or combinations of these) have not been satisfactory.​[[23]](#Solish-2DAD373F) These are not Health Canada–approved indications.​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)​[[50]](#DelBozJ.SystemicTreatmentOfHyperhid-5BB402F2) Anticholinergic adverse effects are significant; in a systematic review, patients experienced dry mouth (39% of patients taking glycopyrrolate and up to 73% of patients taking >10 mg/day of oxybutynin) in addition to other common (~5–10%) adverse effects such as constipation, blurred vision, headache, urinary retention and palpitations.​[[49]](#CruddasLBakerDM.TreatmentOfPrimaryH-5502BAAC)​[[51]](#NationalInstituteForHealthAndCareEx-5503AB6D) They are not recommended in patients with glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, urinary retention or in situations where patients are at risk of becoming overheated (as they may interfere with thermoregulation by limiting patients’ ability to sweat for cooling purposes).

Other oral agents that have been used based on limited evidence from case reports include clonazepam, clonidine, diltiazem, paroxetine and propranolol.​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)​[[50]](#DelBozJ.SystemicTreatmentOfHyperhid-5BB402F2)

### Medical Procedures

The following procedures may be considered for treatment of hyperhidrosis that is refractory to other nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment (i.e., are second- or third-line treatments).

- **Iontophoresis** is a second-line procedure using electrical currents that is often used for palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis that is not responding to topical aluminum chloride therapy. It is considered safe and effective​[[23]](#Solish-2DAD373F)​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)​[[52]](#WadeRLlewellynAJones-DietteJEtAl.In-53786970) and is widely recommended.​[[53]](#PariserDMBallardA.IontophoresisForP-53766B9A)​[[54]](#RzanyBBecharaFGFeiseKEtAl.UpdateOfT-53771EEF) This process uses a water bath apparatus to introduce a mild electrical current of soluble ions into the skin; it is thought to work by blocking the sweat ducts at the skin surface or by inducing an electrical change in the sweat glands and disrupting secretion.​[[1]](#psc1161n1001) The water used in the process must contain enough minerals and electrolytes to be effective; plain tap water is generally sufficient unless the water is too “soft,” in which case adding 1 tablespoon of baking soda to each tray of water is suggested. Anticholinergic medications such as glycopyrrolate added to the water may increase efficacy.​[[55]](#DolianitisCScarffCEKellyJEtAl.Ionto-C3407768) Commercially available devices can be used at home. The process is time-consuming and not practical for some, depending on the area being treated.​[[1]](#psc1161n1001) Initially, 3–4 treatments per week, each lasting approximately 30 minutes, may be needed. When adequate relief has been obtained, ongoing treatment is continued once per week to maintain the effect.​[[15]](#SinghSDavisHWilsonP.AxillaryHyperhi-99AE0552)​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0) Side effects are minor and consist of dry or cracked skin, tingling or burning, and, rarely, redness and small blisters. If any of these side effects occur, the voltage can be decreased. An emollient can be applied for dry skin, or a low-potency topical corticosteroid can be used to treat redness/inflammation.​[[53]](#PariserDMBallardA.IontophoresisForP-53766B9A) Iontophoresis is contraindicated in anyone who is pregnant, has a metallic implant or has a pacemaker.​[[24]](#psc1161n1005)
- **Microwave energy** is readily absorbed by tissues with high water content and is used to destroy sweat glands via thermolysis; this method is considered second line. The miraDry device is used in some clinics in Canada but requires further studies to confirm efficacy and long-term safety. The procedure takes about 1 hour to complete and must be repeated after 3 months. Adverse effects may include swelling, discomfort, numbness and patchy alopecia.​[[5]](#Sammons-4D89713F)​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)
- **Laser techniques** may be beneficial for some patients with axillary hyperhidrosis in order to destroy sweat glands; this method is considered second line. Laser treatment can specifically target and destroy sweat glands. Evidence is limited to small studies, but it may be an option for some patients who have failed other treatments. Patients may experience some swelling, bruising or irritation in the treated area.​[[37]](#JacobCI.ExaminingHyperhydrosisAnUpd-4614BFF0)
- **Percutaneous injection of** ethanol is used for bromhidrosis by destroying sweat glands. Limited evidence has suggested that this technique is safe and effective and may be a less invasive alternative to surgery.​[[56]](#AsilianAShahbaziMAbtahi-NaeiniBEtAl-5507D2C9)​[[57]](#HanXLiF.PercutaneousEthanolInjectio-5508074A)
- **Surgery, i.e., removal of sweat glands**, should be considered only when all other options for treatment have failed (i.e., third line) and permanent elimination of sweating is desired. One approach involves removal of the axillary sweat glands by excision, liposuction, curettage or laser. Removal of axillary glands is generally performed in a surgical setting under local anesthesia​[[14]](#BensonRAPalinRHoltPJE.EtAl.Diagnosi-99A4A94A)​[[58]](#GlaserDAGalperinTA.LocalProceduralA-9BB27D0E) and is considered an emerging therapy, as the evidence base is limited.​[[14]](#BensonRAPalinRHoltPJE.EtAl.Diagnosi-99A4A94A)
- **Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS)** is a major surgical procedure involving cutting nerves that signal sweat glands; this method is considered third line. It is mainly used to treat palmoplantar hyperhidrosis but it has also shown some success in treating axillary and craniofacial hyperhidrosis. In addition to the risk of surgical complications, a major disadvantage is that compensatory hyperhidrosis may be induced in other areas of the body (usually back, abdomen, thighs, chest), which can be worse than the original condition.​[[14]](#BensonRAPalinRHoltPJE.EtAl.Diagnosi-99A4A94A)​[[19]](#McConaghyJRFosselmanD.Hyperhydrosis-461482D3)​[[24]](#psc1161n1005)

### Monitoring of Therapy

[Table 4](#psc1161n01020) provides a monitoring plan framework, which should be individualized.

**Table 4:** Monitoring of Therapy for Excessive Perspiration and Body Odour

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Underarm wetness | Monitor daily for 2–3 wk while using antiperspirants as well as a daily personal hygiene routine. | Dry axillae in resting, nonstressed state at comfortable room temperature after 2–3 wk of intervention. | If aluminum chloride hexahydrate products are effective, reduce frequency to level required to maintain effect. If patient cannot tolerate aluminum chloride hexahydrate products (mild or stronger strengths) or is not responding after a 2–3 wk treatment trial, consider other treatment options. |
| Hand sweating | Monitor daily while using antiperspirants applied to the palms of the hands for 1–3 wk. | Hand sweating reduced to a tolerable level after 3 wk of intervention. | If hand sweating interferes with social or occupational activities, refer to a health-care practitioner. If patient cannot tolerate aluminum chloride hexahydrate or is not responding after a 3-wk trial, consider other treatment options. |
| Foot sweating | Monitor daily while using a regular foot-care routine including nonpharmacologic therapy as indicated previously. Monitor daily for 1–3 wk while using antiperspirants and/or absorbent foot powders. | Foot sweating reduced to a tolerable level after 3 wk of treatment. | If patient cannot tolerate products containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate or is not responding to treatment after a 3-wk trial, consider other treatment options. |
| Body odour | Monitor daily while using a personal hygiene routine that includes washing with soap and water, changing clothing as required, and regular use of antiperspirants. | Offensive body odour eliminated after 1–2 wk of intervention. | If personal hygiene measures and antiperspirants are ineffective after 1–2 wk , consider other treatment options. |
| Skin irritation from antiperspirants | Monitor daily for skin irritation (redness/inflammation, pain, burning, itch) in the area of application. | Antiperspirant tolerated with minimal or no irritation. | Ensure correct use (to completely dry skin) and, if irritation continues, use a different brand, a lower concentration aluminum product, a product with a salicylic acid gel base or a deodorant. Treat symptomatically with low-potency topical corticosteroid cream twice daily for no more than 14 days if irritation severe. If irritation continues, stop antiperspirant and consider other treatment options. |
| Side effects of anticholinergic drugs | Monitor daily for dry mouth, urinary hesitancy, mydriasis and photophobia. | Side effects tolerable. | If side effects affect quality of life, discontinue use in consultation with health-care practitioner . |
| Signs and symptoms of dehydration: increased thirst, dry mouth/tongue, decreased urination, feeling weak or lightheaded | Monitor daily during period of excessive sweating. | No signs of dehydration | Regularly replace water and electrolytes lost through excessive sweating. |

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Drug Class: Antiperspirants**

| aluminum salts, various (e.g., aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine, aluminum sesquichlorohydrate) in solid, spray formats Arrid , Speed Stick , others <$5 | Apply to completely dry skin on affected area daily to BID (if once daily, HS preferred) | Local irritation. | Not applicable. | Avoid application on freshly shaved or abraded skin if irritation is a concern. |
| aluminum chloride hexahydrate Drysol , Hydrosal , Perspirex , others $$$$ | 6.25– 20% : apply to completely dry skin on affected area at HS × 3 days or until desired effect reached and then taper to 2–3 times weekly to maintain effect. Choose lower strengths for sensitive areas such as forehead and stronger strengths for palms and soles | Local irritation. Correct application and starting with lower strengths can minimize irritation. | Not applicable. | A cool blow dryer may be used to completely dry the skin prior to application. |

**Drug Class: Deodorants**

| potassium alum /​ ammonium alum Crystal Body Deodorant , others <$5 | Crystal format: moisten crystal then apply to affected area | Possible local irritation. | Not applicable. | Mask/neutralize body odour only. |
| zinc salts (water soluble: zinc chloride, zinc gluconate, zinc lactate), zinc oxide, corn starch Dr. Scholl’s Powder , Odor Eaters , others $5–10 | Apply to affected area daily | Possible local irritation. | Not applicable. | Tend to be contained in foot powders and sprays. |

**Drug Class: Anticholinergics**
