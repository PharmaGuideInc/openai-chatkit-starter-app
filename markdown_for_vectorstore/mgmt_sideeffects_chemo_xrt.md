### Introduction

Radiation and systemic cancer therapy can be highly toxic and may confer side effects normally considered unacceptable in the treatment of other diseases. Furthermore, patients with cancer are now living long enough for unique, delayed side effects to manifest.

Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs exploit this difference by affecting fast-growing, highly proliferative cells during replication, therefore killing more cancer cells than normal cells. Hematopoietic cells, the skin and its appendages, and the epithelium of the intestine are also highly proliferative; thus, they are susceptible to toxicity from chemotherapy.

Increased understanding of the human genome and the drivers of cancer growth have led to the development of many targeted cancer therapies. Unlike conventional chemotherapy agents, which affect both cancer cells and normal cells, targeted therapies inhibit specific cellular processes upon which the particular cancer cell is dependent for growth. Although this means there are less of the toxicities usually associated with conventional chemotherapy, there are unique and unexpected toxicities that can arise because the targeted processes may exist in some normal tissues as well. Targeted therapies have replaced conventional chemotherapy as standard treatment in some cancers (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia), are used in conjunction with conventional treatment (e.g., in breast cancer) and are options when standard therapies fail (e.g., thyroid cancer). Targeted therapies are typically monoclonal antibodies or their structural derivatives or small molecule inhibitors.

With pharmacologic cancer therapies, most side effects occur upon exposure and generally resolve over time once therapy is completed. In contrast, any organ that is exposed to radiation can develop early toxicities (within days to months) or delayed toxicities (within months to years). Radiation is delivered locally; thus, toxicities usually occur locally. Global toxicities such as myelosuppression are typically rare unless the patient undergoes total body irradiation. X-rays travel through the tissues from an entry point into the body to an exit point out of the body. Toxicities can occur throughout this area. The degree of toxicity is dependent on the area irradiated and the type of radiation therapy that is used.

This chapter’s focus is on select toxicities of radiation and pharmacologic cancer therapy that are predictable and preventable in onset or severity. While pediatric management is generally the same, the focus is the adult patient. [Table 1](#n00440) lists common pharmacologic cancer therapy classes. [Table 2](#n00441) and [Table 3](#n00442) provide information on the prevention and management of toxicities of pharmacologic cancer therapies and radiation therapy, respectively. [Table 4](#c0110n00116) contains more detailed information on the pharmacologic therapies used to prevent and manage these toxicities.

### Goals of Therapy

- Prevent toxicity, if possible, by treating risk factors and applying preventive measures
- Reduce the severity of toxicity and subsequent complications by early detection and management
- Improve or control symptoms of toxicity if they occur
- Improve or maintain quality of life and the ability to perform activities of daily living
- Prevent morbidity and mortality
- Enable patient to complete the recommended treatment course, i.e., not have to stop treatment early due to adverse effects

### Therapeutic Tips

- Patient education and involvement in preventive measures and detection are paramount.
- Full disclosure of side effects to the patient will ensure better management of toxicity.
- Contrary to some beliefs, discussion of side effects does not predispose patients to experiencing them.​[[1]](#c0110n00131)​[[2]](#c0110n00132)
- Frequency and severity of toxicity are dependent on the drug, dose, dosing schedule and route of administration.
- Increasingly, oncology drugs are being approved via expedited or conditional mechanisms to speed patient access to effective therapies. Such approvals may occur in the absence of long-term safety data, making postmarketing surveillance vital to the accurate documentation of the nature and incidence of toxicities. However, the under-reporting of adverse reactions by health professionals is a recognized, multifactorial problem.​[[3]](#c0110n00393)​[[4]](#c0110n00394) There is a significant discrepancy between the incidence of toxicity reports from patients and those of health professionals.​[[4]](#c0110n00394) Health-care practitioners are encouraged to have a low threshold for reporting their patients’ adverse reactions to [Health Canada](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/pdf/medeff/report-declaration/ser-des_form-eng.pdf).
- Drug therapies are becoming increasingly targeted with side effects unique to the drug or class. Valuable information can be found in the websites of provincial cancer agencies (see [Suggested Readings](#c0110n00312)).

### Prevention and Management of Select Toxicities of Cancer Therapies

**Table 2:** Prevention and Management of Select Toxicities of Pharmacologic Cancer Therapy

| Toxicity/Organ Involved(time frame to onset) | Classes/Drugs Commonly Implicated​[a] | Prevention | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiac |
| Arterial thromboembolism (angina, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, stroke) (within days to weeks) | VEGF inhibitors | Identify and manage risk factors for myocardial and cerebral infarction and ischemia. See Acute Coronary Syndromes , Prevention of Ischemic Stroke and Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease . | Manage risk factors with consideration of the patient’s clinical status and prognosis. VEGF inhibitors are usually discontinued if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs. |
| Coronary vasospasm and myocardial ischemia (within hours to days) | Fluoropyrimidines | Initiate cautiously in patients with coronary artery disease. Aggressive control of modifiable risk factors is important during and after treatment. Avoid in patients with severe or unstable conditions.​ [5] | Usually reversible with cessation of the drug. Treat symptomatically with nitrates and calcium channel blockers . Discontinuation of fluoropyrimidine suggested if feasible.​ [6] |
| Heart failure (within months to years) | HER2 inhibitors (highest with trastuzumab), VEGF inhibitors, multikinase inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, osimertinib | Routine cardiac monitoring for all patients receiving trastuzumab.​ [7] Avoid simultaneous administration with other cardiotoxic chemotherapies.​ [5] ​ [8] For other agents, more frequent cardiac monitoring if cardiac risk factors present, which continues into survivorship.​ [7] ​ [9] | For HER2 therapies, interruption of therapy for asymptomatic reductions in ejection fraction. Treatment can be restarted in many patients. Discontinuation usually recommended if clinically symptomatic or if interruptions are required multiple times despite optimization of cardiac management.​ [5] ​ [8] Standard management of left ventricular dysfunction with ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or beta-blockers. A similar approach can be used with VEGF inhibitors.​ [5] ​ [9] See Heart Failure . |
| Anthracyclines | Limit lifelong cumulative doses to below predefined safe thresholds.​ [10] Regimens with longer infusion times (>6 h) may have lower risk.​ [11] Prophylaxis with statins, beta-blockers and/or ARBs are under prospective evaluation, having shown some trends for benefit.​ [5] ​ [12] Liposomal formulations of anthracyclines reduce the risk but may not be a valid substitute in every indication. Dexrazoxane is used in certain patients (e.g., those with metastatic disease) whose lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose exceeds safe thresholds or who have underlying cardiac risk factors. Assess cardiac function periodically.​ [5] ​ [9] | Clinically indistinguishable from heart failure due to other causes. Treat symptomatically.​ [9] See Heart Failure . |
| Hypertension (within weeks to months) | VEGF inhibitors, multikinase small molecule inhibitors | Identify and manage risk factors for hypertension. Monitor blood pressure with every cycle of treatment with expectation of blood pressure elevations within the first few cycles of therapy.​ [5] | Manage blood pressure aggressively but with consideration to the patient’s clinical status and prognosis. See Hypertension . |
| QT c prolongation (possible torsades de pointes arrhythmia) (within days to weeks) | Many small molecule kinase inhibitors | Initiate cautiously in patients with risk factors (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome, heart failure, electrolyte imbalances).​ [5] Dose reductions based on QT c are recommended for some drugs. Avoid unnecessary use of multiple drugs with additive risk of QT c prolongation.​ [13] | If benefit of using the drug outweighs risk, monitor and resolve risk factors; perform baseline ECG and monitor frequently. Evaluate need for dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation when QT c interval exceeds 450–500 msec or ≥60 msec above baseline.​ [5] |
| Venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (within weeks to months) | Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​ [b] bevacizumab, tamoxifen, sunitinib, thalidomide analogues | Cancer is a major risk factor for venous thromboembolism and patients should receive prophylaxis accordingly. See Venous Thromboembolism . Routine prophylaxis with ASA or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be required for patients with multiple myeloma receiving regimens containing high-dose dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue (e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide). In patients at high risk of VTE, LMWH are preferred, although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be feasible as well.​​ [5] ​ [14] | Low molecular weight heparins and DOACs (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) preferred for long-term anticoagulation.​ [5] ​ [14] Vitamin K antagonists should be used with caution and only if alternatives are not accessible, as cancer patients are susceptible to wide fluctuations in INR. See Venous Thromboembolism . |
| Dermatologic |
| Alopecia (partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body) (within weeks to months) | Many, but not all, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​ [b] depending on the dose and the regimen used | To delay or minimize hair loss, treat hair gently by using mild shampoos and soft hairbrushes, and avoiding harsh chemicals and high heat settings on hair dryer (see Hair Care and Hair Growth ). Evidence for effectiveness of scalp cooling in delaying hair loss and promoting hair recovery is increasing but tolerability of scalp cooling, high cost and product variability hinders wide acceptance.​ [15] ​ [16] | Degree and location of hair loss is dependent on the individual, the combination of drugs used, and the dose and scheduling of the treatment. Cosmetic intervention using wigs, hats or scarves. Treat underlying causes (e.g., inflammation or dermatitis) and deficiencies (e.g., nutrient deficiency), if present. Observational data suggests minoxidil 2% or 5% has benefit in possibly reducing the severity and/or duration of alopecia induced by treatment.​ [17] ​ [18] |
| Extravasation (leakage from IV line into surrounding tissues resulting in tissue inflammation and necrosis) (during infusion to days) | Anthracyclines, antitumor antibiotics, mechlorethamine, platinums, taxanes, vinca alkaloids | Insertion of needle cannula must follow standardized protocols to reduce the risk of extravasation (e.g., careful selection of IV site, ensuring blood return and fluid flow). Use of a central venous catheter should be considered for high-risk drugs that have prolonged infusion times. The site should be monitored throughout chemotherapy treatment.​ [19] | Stop infusion. Aspirate any residual drug remaining in tissues. Apply cold compresses for 20 min 4 times daily for 1–2 days. Cold compresses should be used for anthracyclines, antitumor antibiotics and mechlorethamine. Local heat application should be used for vinca alkaloids, taxanes and platinums. Drug-specific antidotes are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dexrazoxane and sodium thiosulfate . Severe cases require plastic surgery. |
| Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (skin discolouration, edema, pain, peeling of skin on fingers and toes) (within weeks to months) | Capecitabine, fluorouracil, liposomal doxorubicin | Apply moisturizers frequently (at least TID) and avoid prolonged heat exposure to hands and feet. Urea-based emollients or diclofenac 1.16% gel are preferred to prevent HFS, especially in patients starting capecitabine. Application should start with the initiation of capecitabine.​ [20] ​ [21] Avoid irritation and friction from ill-fitting shoes and clothing. Vitamin B 6 150–200 mg/day is sometimes prescribed (but protective effect is not supported by evidence).​ [22] | Dose interruptions and reduction result in greatest benefit. Manage promptly with symptomatic treatments and analgesics . Discontinue therapy if severe or recurrent. Wound care for desquamation and ulcerations.​ [22] |
| Hand-foot-skin reaction (HFSR) (skin discolouration, edema, pain, peeling of skin on fingers and toes, hyperkeratosis at pressure points) (within weeks to months) | BRAF inhibitors, multikinase VEGF inhibitors | Apply moisturizers frequently (at least TID) and avoid extremes of temperature. Urea-based emollients may be preferred.​ [23] Avoid irritation and friction from ill-fitting shoes and clothing. Limit prolonged pressure to weight-bearing areas and treat existing calluses and hyperkeratosis.​ [24] ​ [25] | Manage promptly with symptomatic treatments and analgesics . Dose interruptions and reduction are helpful. Discontinue therapy if severe or recurrent. Wound care for desquamation and ulcerations.​ [24] |
| Pruritus (within weeks to months) | Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​ [b] checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors | See Pruritus . | Management of pruritus is empirical and supported by few treatment-specific studies (see Pruritus ). While pruritus usually accompanies rash and can be managed based on rash severity (see Rash, immune-related ), the presentation of pruritus without overt skin damage has been reported. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced pruritus has to be managed with additional considerations: i) the immunosuppressants used in pruritus (e.g., azathioprine) may potentially counteract the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors and should be avoided, ii) high-dose PO or IV corticosteroids are required for severe pruritus. |
| Rash, immune-related (local or diffuse rash with or without pruritus) (within weeks) | BiTEs, CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors | No known prophylaxis measures. | Cold compresses, oatmeal baths, topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines for mild symptoms. Monitor for progression to severe dermatologic toxicities (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). Severe symptoms require systemic corticosteroids and treatment interruption or discontinuation.​ [26] ​ [27] |
| Rash related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition (acne-like papules on the head, face, upper chest and back) (within weeks) | Cetuximab, osimertinib, panitumumab, possibly ibrutinib, EGFR directed monoclonal antibodies, EGFR small molecule inhibitors | Moisturize liberally with hypoallergenic lotions. Limit UV exposure (apply sunscreen to exposed areas). Avoid harsh chemicals, soaps or detergents. Use cool or lukewarm water instead of hot water for showers. Avoid prolonged baths.​ [28] Proactive use of topical corticosteroids and oral tetracyclines can be considered in select patients.​ [29] | Mild reactions can be managed with hydrophilic moisturizers , topical corticosteroids +/- topical clindamycin . Oral tetracyclines for more severe rashes. Localized itch will improve as rash improves. Severe itch may be alleviated with antihistamines. Avoid alcohol-containing products and acne treatments due to drying effect.​ [29] In severe or refractory cases, other agents have been employed, including oral corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) and/or antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. |
| Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat (EENT) |
| Conjunctivitis (within days) | Anthracyclines, cytarabine (doses >2 g/m​ 2 ), fluoropyrimidines | Artificial tears may have a dilutional effect. For cytarabine, prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% ophthalmic Q4–6H started before and continued >48 h post-cytarabine.​ [30] Ophthalmic diclofenac may also have a role.​ [31] No standard preventive measures for other chemotherapies. | Usually reversible upon discontinuation of offending agent. Artificial tears to provide local relief. Corticosteroid ophthalmic preparations to manage inflammation. Ocular pain may require analgesics . |
| Lacrimal obstruction and excessive tearing (within months) | Docetaxel (most frequently with weekly schedules of docetaxel) | No proven preventative measures. | Mild symptoms can be managed via supportive measures by reducing eye irritation. Educate patients that excess tearing is due to poor drainage, not excess tear development. Reduction of underlying causes such as dry eyes, allergy symptoms and physical irritation may reduce tear production. Moderate or severe symptoms will require an ophthalmologist consult for possible bilateral stent insertion into the canalicular ducts.​ [32] |
| Ocular toxicity (retinopathy, iritis, uveitis and others) (weeks to months) | BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, erdafitinib | Baseline assessment to allow for proper assessment of ongoing visual changes. | Management is based on the specific drug, and can include dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation depending on the drug and the toxicity. Ophthalmology and optometry should be involved for ongoing management.​ [33] |
| Ototoxicity (within weeks to months) | Platinums | Audiograms every 3–4 cycles, especially in patients at risk (pre-existing hearing loss, chronic noise exposure, high cumulative doses of cisplatin).​ [34] | Can be irreversible. Reduce doses or change treatment if possible. |
| Gastrointestinal |
| Cholinergic syndrome and acute diarrhea (abdominal cramps, flushing, miosis, lacrimation, rhinitis) (during infusion to hours) | Irinotecan | Reduce the rate of infusion. Avoid regimens that use high doses of irinotecan. Educate patient to report symptoms immediately so that treatment can be initiated.​ [35] | Symptoms managed with atropine 0.3–0.6 mg SC/IV PRN. Subsequent cycles of irinotecan may require prophylactic atropine in patients who develop severe reactions.​ [36] |
| Constipation (within weeks to months ) | Vinca alkaloids, platinums | While vinca alkaloids and platinums are reported to cause constipation, the most common cause of chemotherapy-associated constipation is due to the use of 5-HT 3 antagonist antiemetics. See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting . Patient education, risk factor assessment and preventive measures should be considered in patients with pre-existing constipation at baseline (e.g., laxatives).​ [37] | Laxatives and nonpharmacologic measures typically used for constipation (see Constipation in Adults ). Suppositories and enemas are used with prolonged, severe constipation, but they may introduce an infection risk in neutropenic patients. Educate patient to discontinue laxatives before the onset of cancer therapy-induced diarrhea.​ [37] |
| Diarrhea, immune-related (diarrhea and symptoms of colitis: blood in stool, abdominal pain, urgency to defecate) (within weeks to months) | BiTEs, CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors | No known prophylaxis measures. | Since the diarrhea is thought to arise from colonic inflammation, it is treated similarly to colitis. Mild, manageable symptoms can be treated with loperamide or diphenoxylate /​ atropine . Systemic corticosteroids ( prednisone or methylprednisolone ) are required for severe symptoms. Checkpoint inhibitor, BiTEs or CAR-T inhibitor treatment is interrupted during severe symptoms. Refractory diarrhea with colitis symptoms will require infliximab , tocilizumab or other anti-TNF or anti-IL agents. Also see Immune-related adverse events of immunotherapies .​ [26] ​ [27] |
| Diarrhea, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced (within days to weeks) | All traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have some risk, usually dose-related | Educate patient on nonpharmacologic management, avoidance of potential triggers and careful monitoring. It is important to treat diarrhea before it progresses in severity. Patients starting traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy at high risk for diarrhea should have antidiarrheal medications on hand. See Diarrhea . | Chemotherapy should be withheld until complete resolution of symptoms without the use of antidiarrheal therapy. Fluids and BRAT diet are recommended. Loperamide (high-dose regimen) is required for irinotecan-induced diarrhea and may also be used in those receiving other traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments who do not respond to the standard-dose regimen. See Table 4 . Diphenoxylate/atropine may be used as a second-line agent. Severe cases require octreotide , antibiotics and IV hydration.​ [38] ​ [39] |
| Mucositis (general, painful erythema or localized lesions) (within days to weeks) | Most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies; severity varies with agent and individual Many targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized classes at higher risk are mTOR inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, BCL inhibitors | Maintain regular oral hygiene regimen, use soft bristled toothbrush. Avoid flossing if gums bleed. Avoid hard or sharp-textured foods. Cryotherapy (ice chips) prevents mucositis or reduces its severity in patients receiving bolus treatments of fluorouracil or high-dose melphalan. Ice and other cold foods are contraindicated with oxaliplatin-containing regimens (e.g., FOLFOX). Dexamethasone oral rinses for the first 2–4 cycles of everolimus treatment reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis.​ [40] Evidence supports the use of low-level laser therapy to prevent mucositis in stem cell transplant settings, but it is used in limited centres due to challenges with access. Employ nonpharmacologic measures: basic oral hygiene and the use of a clean, soft-bristle toothbrush that is replaced on a regular basis, judicious flossing and the use of bland mouthwashes such as baking soda and/or salt rinses or alcohol-free mouthwashes.​ [41] For persistent oral thrush complications of mucositis, see Table 3 , Candidiasis (oral) | Bland (saline or baking soda) rinses or combination mouthwashes for mild symptoms, if not already being used. Avoid alcohol-containing products, which may irritate. Combination mouthwashes usually are institution-specific and contain varying proportions of lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacids, nystatin and dexamethasone. There is no optimal formulation. Doxepin 0.5% oral rinse may be effective in relieving pain associated with oral mucositis. Systemic analgesics (e.g., opioids) for severe mucositis.​ [41] ​ [42] ​ [43] Barrier forming viscous gels may form a healing environment for mucositis, although more conclusive evidence is needed.​ [44] For persistent oral thrush complications of mucositis, see Table 3 , Candidiasis (oral). |
| Nausea and vomiting (during infusion and within days) |  | See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting . |
| Hematologic |
| Anemia (within weeks to months) | Most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies;​ [b] severity varies with agent and individual | No proven preventive measures. Assess for and correct underlying nutritional anemia (e.g., folic acid, iron, vitamin B 12 ) prior to cancer treatment. Erythropoietics should not be used prophylactically.​ [45] Maintain a high suspicion for functional iron deficiency. Unlike true/absolute iron deficiency, functional iron deficiency is a product of poor iron mobilization and transport instead of inadequate stores of iron.​ [46] ​ [47] | Packed red blood cells given to patients with severe or symptomatic anemia. Erythropoietics ( epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa ) to reduce the need for transfusions in select patients with hemoglobin <100 g/L .​ [45] ​ [46] Iron dextran, iron sucrose or ferric derisomaltose IV for functional iron deficiency. IV iron in combination with erythropoietics increases hemoglobin more effectively than either agent alone. Oral iron supplements can be used for absolute iron deficiency but are generally ineffective for functional iron deficiency.​ [48] Implement nonpharmacologic measures for fatigue; see Fatigue in Other toxicities below. |
| Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies​ [b] will cause neutropenia; the risk of febrile neutropenia is the greater concern) (within days to weeks) | Varies with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agent, regimen and individual risk factors Many targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized class at higher risk are the CDK 4/6 inhibitors | Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors ( pegfilgrastim and filgrastim ) in patients at high risk of febrile neutropenia where chemotherapy dosage reductions or delays should be avoided (i.e., where a delay could worsen outcomes).​ [49] Antibiotics (e.g., levofloxacin) can be used instead in select patients.​ [49] ​ [50] Minimize risk of infection (wash hands thoroughly and frequently, avoid large crowds and people with colds or flu. Maintain good hygiene (shower or bathe regularly, prevent cuts, burns, and sunburns). Avoid foods that may increase infection risk (partially cooked meats, raw unpasteurized eggs, rinds on cheese, mould-ripened cheeses). Monitor for symptoms of infection.​ [49] ​ [51] | Rapid recognition and response to potential infection required. Standard management of febrile neutropenia includes empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, clinical assessment and supportive care. See Infections in the Cancer Patient . |
| Thrombocytopenia (within weeks to months) | Occurs rarely with many traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies; severity varies with agent and individual Many targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized class at higher risk are the CDK 4/6 inhibitors | No proven preventive measures. | Platelet transfusions are the mainstay of treatment for severe thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy. |
| Immunologic |
| Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (can be severe: fever, malaise, hypotension, capillary leakage, tachycardia, hypoxia, capillary leakage) (during infusion to days) | CAR-T agents, BiTEs, interleukin | Administration occurs in facilities with the expertise and skills to manage the reactions. Patients are usually hospitalized or in specialized facilities for initiation of treatment. Premedication with antihistamines, acetaminophen and hydration. | Mild symptoms are managed supportively based on symptoms (vasopressors, corticosteroids, antihistamines, bronchodilators, oxygen). Severe symptoms require high-dose systemic corticosteroids, possibly ICU care and the anti-IL6 agent tocilizumab.​ [52] |
| Hypersensitivity reactions (immune reactions mediated by IgE, histamine, mast cells) (during infusion to within hours) | Traditional cytotoxics: asparaginase, bleomycin, epipodophyllotoxins, platinums, procarbazine | Preventive measures generally not initiated for most agents. For bleomycin, the use of a test dose is suggested but is not universally accepted.​ [53] | Stop chemotherapy infusion. Administer antihistamines , steroids, vasoconstrictors. Supportive care. Consider other cancer treatments if reactions are severe. Desensitization protocols (e.g., with platinum therapies) have been used when treatment must be continued or no other alternative exists.​ [54] |
| Taxanes | Taxanes are premedicated with oral or IV corticosteroids (usually started at least 12 h prior to chemo) and antihistamines (H 1 - and H 2 -blockers given right before chemotherapy). | Stop chemotherapy infusion. Medical and supportive care with antihistamines, corticosteroids, vasoconstrictors, oxygen, bronchodilators . Reintroduction must be done cautiously with slower infusions and premedication. Nab-paclitaxel has the least likelihood of reactions and is considered an alternative to paclitaxel in certain cancers.​ [55] |
| Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of immunotherapies (variable onset, median of weeks) | CAR-T agents, BiTEs, checkpoint inhibitors | Proper education of the patient to respond promptly to symptoms that suggest an irAE is developing. Proactive assessments for irAEs with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., endocrinopathies, pneumonitis)​ [26] ​ [27] | Can manifest as an acute inflammation of any organ and occurs at any time (as early as within hours of first dose to many months after treatment cessation).​ [27] Mild symptoms can be managed with routine care; however, high doses of corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone or methylprednisolone sodium succinate) are required for moderate to severe symptoms, with prolonged corticosteroid tapering upon symptom resolution. Severe events usually necessitate discontinuation of the immunotherapy agent.​ [26] ​ [27] |
| Infusion reactions (immunologic reaction that is cytokine-mediated or results from interactions with molecular target) (during infusion to within hours) | Monoclonal antibodies | Premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines and antipyretics is required for antibodies with highest risk of reaction (e.g., rituximab ) and can be options for those with lower incidence of reactions (e.g., bevacizumab , panitumumab ). | Severe reactions require cessation of infusion and administration of vasopressors, corticosteroids, antihistamines, bronchodilators. Consider discontinuation of therapy in severe cases. Mild reactions can be managed by slowing the infusion rate​ [56] or administering antihistamines and/or corticosteroids before continuing infusion. |
| Metabolic |
| Hyperglycemia (within days to weeks) | Corticosteroids, PIK3CA inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors | Treat baseline hyperkalemia and manage pre-existing diabetes. Monitor levels while on treatment.​ [57] Encourage patient to seek their endocrinologist or primary care provider’s advice for a proactive management plan in case blood sugars rise when starting a new therapy. | Metformin is considered first line.​ [57] Manage as per Diabetes Canada guidelines (see Diabetes Mellitus ). |
| Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia (within days to weeks) | EGFR inhibitors, platinums | Treat deficiencies prior to administration of cancer therapies. Monitor levels while on treatment. Mg​ ++ and K​ + given IV with some chemotherapy protocols. | Supplemental magnesium and potassium to replace deficits. Mild deficits often managed with oral supplements. |
| Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) (product of excess cell lysis resulting in hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, which can lead to renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias and seizures) (within hours to days) | Risk of TLS depends on tumor characteristics and the cancer therapy agent used | Appropriate identification and prevention for patients at risk. For example, the risk is high in patients with extensive, bulky or disseminated malignancies that are rapidly proliferating. It is often associated with aggressive hematologic malignancies, and often associated with the initiation of CD-antigen directed targeted therapy. While less recognized, non-hematologic malignancies can also precipitate TLS. Assess for pre-existing hyperuricemia and renal impairment. Aggressive hydration ± diuretics to maintain adequate urine output, short course of allopurinol or rasburicase to prevent and manage hyperuricemia. Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and urine output, with accordant adjustments of contents of IV fluids.​ [58] ​ [59] | Fluid management. Treatment of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia if symptomatic or severe. Severe hyperuricemia is managed with rasburicase . Allopurinol may be used in mild TLS or in moderate-severe TLS with significant hyperuricemia if other options (e.g., rasburicase) are contraindicated or not available/funded. Dialysis for severe electrolyte abnormalities or signs of acute renal failure.​ [58] ​ [59] |
| Musculoskeletal |
| Arthralgias and myalgias (within hours to days) | Aromatase inhibitors, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), interferons, taxanes, others | Increased hydration prior to and during therapy may benefit myalgias associated with interferon.​ [60] No proven preventive measures for taxanes or aromatase inhibitors, although gabapentin and antihistamines have been tried.​ [61] Naproxen has shown efficacy in the treatment of G-CSF-induced bone pain.​ [62] ​ [63] | Systemic analgesics and rest. Introduce mild exercise, behavioural (e.g., relaxation techniques) and physical therapies (e.g., massage).​ [64] Rule out abrupt cessation of corticosteroids in premedications or antiemetic regimens (for taxanes) as the cause. Acetaminophen is usually first-line in mild pain. NSAID s may be considered if acetaminophen fails or is contraindicated. For severe, refractory, G-CSF-induced pain, loratadine has been effective in case reports.​ [65] ​ [66] Educate patients that acetaminophen and NSAIDs (unless patient has severe thrombocytopenia) can reduce the ability to detect fever and febrile neutropenia. |
| Osteoporosis (within months to years) | Aromatase inhibitors, antiandrogens | Calcium and vitamin D intake should be assessed prior to therapy and maintained at 1200 mg/day (or more) of elemental calcium and 800 units/day of vitamin D.​ [67] | See Osteoporosis . |
| Neurologic |
| Autonomic neurotoxicity (bradycardia, postural hypotension, bladder and bowel disturbances, vocal and ocular changes) (within weeks to months) | Vincristine, vinorelbine | For constipation, use stimulant laxatives if necessary. | Dose reduction may be necessary with severe toxicity or the drugs may have to be avoided altogether. Rule out other causes that may present with autonomic dysfunction symptoms such as CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease. |
| Cognitive changes (“chemo fog” or “chemo brain”: impaired memory, confusion, decreased concentration) (within weeks to months) | All therapies; severity varies with agent and individual | See Suggested Readings for patient education and nonpharmacologic measures. | “Chemo fog” usually resolves once treatment is complete but can be persistent in a subset of patients. Rule out contributing conditions (e.g., anemia, metabolic disorders). Because pharmacologic (e.g., methylphenidate, modafinil) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., cognitive training) measures for severe deficits have demonstrated mixed results, they are not routinely recommended.​ [68] ​ [69] |
| Laryngeal and pharyngeal nerve toxicity (dysesthesia) (mouth, throat and jaw numbness, pain and spasms, precipitated by cold temperatures) (during infusion or within hours) | Oxaliplatin | Nonpharmacologic measures: avoid cold exposure (e.g., from the wind, refrigerator, cold water) while receiving oxaliplatin.​ [70] Symptoms tend to worsen in severity and duration with repeated administration. | Acute onset symptoms can be managed with bronchodilators and antihistamines but usually resolve spontaneously. Persistent symptoms may be alleviated by slowing the rate of infusion of oxaliplatin and/or withholding oxaliplatin from the chemotherapy regimen.​ [71] |
| Peripheral neurotoxicity (sensory and/or motor damage to nerves) (within weeks to months) | Proteasome inhibitors, platinums, taxanes, vinca alkaloids | Usually cumulative dose–related. Education and increased monitoring in patients at risk (e.g., those with diabetic neuropathy) so that dose adjustments can be made prior to severe damage. Avoid extremes of temperature. Maintain skin and nail integrity (moisturizing, skin care) to avoid aggravation of symptoms. No established preventive measures.​ [72] | Dose reductions or longer intervals between cycles. With severe toxicity, the drugs may have to be avoided altogether. Duloxetine has demonstrated improved pain control compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials.​ [73] Gabapentin, pregabalin and venlafaxine may also be used but the evidence is limited or of poor quality.​ [71] ​ [74] |
| Renal |
| Hemorrhagic cystitis (diffuse inflammation of the bladder leading to mucosal edema and hemorrhage) (within weeks to months) | Cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide | Mesna, diuresis and hydration administered while on chemotherapy. Administer chemotherapy as early in the day as possible to minimize the amount of damaging metabolites in prolonged contact with the bladder at night. Educate patient to drink plenty of fluids and to urinate frequently. | Mild cases can be managed with bladder irrigation or the use of intravesical astringents (e.g., alum ) or systemic antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid ). Cystoscopy and/or surgery may be required for more severe cases.​ [75] Dose reduction or drug discontinuation may be required. |
| Nephrotoxicity (within days to weeks) | Carmustine, ifosfamide, methotrexate, mitomycin, platinums, streptozocin | Prevention varies with the chemotherapy. Vigorous hydration and alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate is required (45–50 mmol/L of IV fluid) to prevent nephrotoxicity before, during and after administration of high doses of methotrexate. Saline-based hydration and forced diuresis with mannitol reduces cisplatin nephrotoxicity.​ [76] | Correct electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Maintain intravascular volume and urine output. Dose reductions and aggressive hydration with subsequent chemotherapy treatment. Dialysis in severe cases. |
| Reproductive |
| Gonadal toxicity (infertility) (within months to years) | Alkylating agents, other regimens | Sperm, oocyte or embryo banking. The decision to use fertility preservation must be made relatively quickly, ideally before chemotherapy begins. Use chemotherapies with the least effect on spermatogenesis or ovarian function. Gonadotropin-releasing hormones are not indicated but may be considered when proven options are not available.​ [77] | Discuss assisted reproduction techniques with patients. Assess for psychosocial concerns that may have developed due to infertility.​ [77] |
| Sexuality changes (altered functioning, reduced libido) (within weeks to months) | All therapies | Effects are prevalent in both men and women during and after cancer therapy (can be months or years). Education and communication prior to their development may facilitate management.​ [78] ​ [79] | Ensure any changes in sexual functioning are addressed, rather than ignored or suppressed.​ [78] ​ [79] |
| Other |
| Carcinogenesis (hematologic malignancies, e.g., secondary leukemias; solid tumors, e.g., skin cancers or melanomas) (within years) | Alkylating agents, BRAF-inhibitors, cladribine, etoposide, fludarabine, venetoclax | Monitor/screen patients with risk factors. Type of secondary cancer and timing of onset varies with the cancer therapy regimen used. Use the least amount of cancer therapy possible to control or cure the disease.​ [80] | Case specific. |
| Fatigue (within days to months) | Most therapies | Prevent and manage contributing factors (pain, emotional distress, sleep issues, anemia, nutrition deficits, drug-related causes). | Treat contributing factors (e.g., anemia, pain). Exercise may be beneficial for some patients with moderate to severe fatigue, but must be undertaken with caution. Use energy conservation techniques, behavioural therapies and mindfulness techniques.​ [81] |
| Flulike syndrome (fever, myalgias, chills) (within hours to days) | Dacarbazine, interferon, gemcitabine, monoclonal antibodies, procarbazine | Premedication with acetaminophen or NSAIDs and adequate hydration. | Control fever and aches/pains with acetaminophen or NSAID s (unless patient has severe thrombocytopenia). Supportive care. |
| Hot flashes (within days to weeks) | Hormonal therapies | Identify and avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, stress). Employ environmental modification.​ [82] | Behavioural and relaxation techniques. Exercise may help. SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine), SSRIs (e.g., citalopram ), clonidine or gabapentin may be used. Oxybutynin may have benefit in patients who do not respond to other agents, but should be implemented cautiously in older patients due to its anticholinergic side effects.​ [83] Little data to distinguish management in different sexes.​ [82] |
| Teratogenicity | Most therapies | Avoid cancer therapies in the first trimester. Avoid exposing patients with the potential to become pregnant to cancer therapies with a high risk of teratogenicity, e.g., antifolates, imatinib, thalidomide and analogues.​ [84] | Contraception necessary while patient receives cancer therapy. |

### Prevention and Management of Side Effects of Radiation Therapy

**Table 3:** Prevention and Management of Side Effects of Radiation Therapy

| Toxicity(time frame to onset) | Location of Radiation | Prevention | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiac |
| Heart disease (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, valve damage, heart failure, ischemia) (within years) | Breast, head and neck, chest, lung, mediastinum | Manage and control risk factors for cardiovascular disease.​ [85] Initiate cardiovascular screening 5 y after radiation exposure (earlier in patients with high risk factors).​ [86] | Implement routine cardiac testing (ECG, echocardiography) if asymptomatic changes have been detected. Aggressive control of risk factors for coronary artery disease and implement treatment when there is progressive deterioration (symptomatic or presence of clinically significant changes). There is no evidence that treatment should differ from that used in heart disease due to other causes. |
| Pericardial disease (within weeks for acute; can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Breast, head and neck, lung, mediastinum | Use of shielding methods and lower doses of radiation have reduced the risk of pericarditis.​ [85] | Supportive care with NSAID s , corticosteroids and colchicine have been used during the acute period. Drainage of persistent effusions. Chronic pericarditis may require pericardiectomy.​ [9] |
| CNS |
| Cognitive decline | Brain | See Suggested Readings for patient education and nonpharmacologic measures. Memantine may delay cognitive decline in patients undergoing cranial radiation. | Some limited evidence suggests donepezil, methylphenidate and modafinil may improve verbal and working memory, motor speed and quality of life. However, it did not improve overall cognitive performance. Behavioural interventions that focus on mindfulness and strategy training might also be helpful.​ [87] ​ [88] ​ [89] |
| Edema (within weeks to years) | Brain | No proven preventive measures. | Typically dexamethasone 4 mg QID PO for moderate to severe symptoms with a slow taper after radiation completed. IV dexamethasone and mannitol may be required for life-threatening edema.​ [87] |
| Headache (within weeks to months) | Brain | Low-dose corticosteroids ( dexamethasone or prednisone ) may help prevent the occurrence of headaches.​ [88] | May indicate brain edema (see Edema): assessment needed for persistent headache. Analgesics for symptom control. |
| Somnolence syndrome and fatigue (within weeks to months or chronic) | Brain, head and neck, lung | No proven preventive measures although various agents are under investigation and exploration.​ [87] | Corticosteroids may decrease the duration of somnolence syndrome in children.​ [89] Also see Table 2 , Fatigue. |
| Dermatologic |
| Alopecia (during treatment to within weeks) | Brain | See Table 2 , Alopecia. |
| Desquamation (during treatment to within weeks) | In radiated area | Wash with mild soaps, shampoos or water alone, using hands rather than abrasive washcloths. Avoid frequent bathing or showering to prevent drying. Avoid friction by wearing loose-fitting clothes. Moisturize radiated area with plain, unscented, preferably lanolin-free hydrophilic moisturizers (e.g., Glaxal Base, Lubriderm). Avoid hot or cold packs, extreme temperatures, harsh chemicals and deodorants in the radiation treatment field. Use an electric razor if shaving is required. Protect from sun. Improve skin elasticity with moisturizers (and sunscreen).​ [90] ​ [91] Application of a soft, silicone dressing (e.g., Mepitel) by the radiation team prior to treatment initiation can provide friction protection and a moist wound healing environment in vulnerable areas of the radiation field (e.g., folds of the skin of the breast or neck) to reduce the severity of radiation-induced moist desquamation.​ [92] ​ [93] Local application of medium- and high-potency topical corticosteroids on radiation days have reduced the severity of dermatitis.​ [93] Low-level laser therapy can prevent the occurrence, severity and pain. | If dry desquamation, use saline compresses and moisturize with plain, unscented, lanolin-free moisturizers (e.g., Glaxal Base, Lubriderm) or vitamin E preparations. If moist desquamation, apply principles of moist wound healing using nonadherent dressings. Add absorbent dressings on top if necessary. Hydrogel and hydrocolloid products may also be considered. Systemic analgesics may be required until recovery.​ [93] ​ [94] ​ [95] |
| Erythema, inflammation and pruritus (during treatment to within weeks) | In radiated area (and exit point) | Apply hydrophilic moisturizers. Low-potency topical corticosteroids for short periods (up to 8 wk) for relief of itchiness.​ [88] |
| Fibrosis, skin discoloration, photosensitivity, ulceration or atrophy (within months to years) | In radiated area | Avoid trauma to area. Wound care for severe symptoms. Physical therapy with gentle massage and myofascial release for fibrosis. Systemic analgesics may be required with painful fibrosis or contractures.​ [88] ​ [90] The benefit of natural and medical products for treatment remains inconclusive (e.g., pentoxifylline , vitamin E , films and dressings, topical corticosteroids, natural supplements).​ [93] Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can improve or resolve symptoms.​ [96] |
| Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat (EENT) |
| Dental caries (within months to years) | Head and neck | Frequent dental checkups. Maintain oral hygiene, use of chlorhexidine rinses, fluoride toothpastes and topical fluoride. Manage xerostomia (dry mouth). Avoid sugary foods and drinks. If nonrestorable, extraction can be considered depending on radiation dose planned, patient condition, risk factors and prognosis. ​Smoking cessation should be considered.​ [97] | Progression of caries can be rapid and destructive. Prevention and early dental management is key to preventing tooth loss. Timing of extraction must be weighed against the risk of osteonecrosis induced by the procedure. The risk of osteonecrosis is dependent on the extent of the extraction procedure and the time since last radiation treatment.​ [98] |
| Gastrointestinal |
| Bowel adhesions and obstruction (within months) | Abdomen | Early recognition and intervention to prevent morbidity. Educate patient about potential symptoms. | Surgical intervention is required, e.g., bypass or resection. |
| Candidiasis (oral) (“thrush”—white patches or plaques of the tongue and oral mucosa due to infection with the yeast Candida ) (weeks to months) | Head and neck | Maintain good oral hygiene. Early recognition and treatment is important to prevent systemic dissemination. Long-term prevention with fluconazole may be required in chronically immune suppressed individuals with recurrent oral candidiasis.​ [99] | Nystatin suspension in mild cases. Clotrimazole troches, oral fluconazole in moderate to severe cases or if refractory to nystatin. Itraconazole or voriconazole used in refractory cases.​ [99] |
| Diarrhea (during treatment to within months) | Abdomen, pelvis | See Table 2 , Diarrhea. Probiotics containing lactobacilli may have preventative effects but dosing is unclear.​ [100] | Loperamide and diphenoxylate /​ atropine . Octreotide if other therapies fail.​ [100] |
| Esophagitis (during treatment to within weeks and can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Chest or mediastinum, head and neck | Acid-reducing agents to reduce acidity and risk of ulceration of mucosa. Amifostine, a cytoprotective agent, may be used to reduce the incidence and severity of esophagitis without compromising treatment efficacy.​ [41] ​ [101] | Systemic analgesics , topical lidocaine , sucralfate and nystatin are commonly used. Acid-reducing agents may be helpful in those with a component of reflux. Treatment interruptions may be required. Chronic esophagitis (fibrosis) may require systemic analgesics and endoscopic dilatation.​ [102] ​ [103] |
| Mucositis (oral) (during treatment to within weeks) | Head and neck, abdomen | Benzydamine oral rinse may prevent radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving treatment for head and neck cancer. Some larger centres may use low-level laser therapy to help prevent mucositis in patients being treated with radiation for head and neck cancers.​ [41] ​ [42] | See Mucositis in Table 2 . |
| Nausea and vomiting (during treatment to within days) | From highest to lowest risk: total body>upper abdomen, cranial≥head and neck, thorax, pelvis> breast, extremeties | 5- HT 3 receptor antagonists ± dexamethasone ± dopamine antagonists are used in accordance with the emetic risk of radiation therapy.​ [104] | See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting for antiemetic options. |
| Proctitis (inflammation of the rectum, causing diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency, tenesmus, possible bleeding and symptoms of obstructed defecation) (weeks to months, or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Abdomen, pelvis | Incidence has decreased with improved radiation techniques and shielding. Amifostine, a cytoprotective agent, may be used to reduce the incidence and severity of proctitis without compromising treatment efficacy.​ [41] ​ [101] | There are no proven techniques for management of proctitis.​ [105] Use sitz baths and topical anti-inflammatory preparations for anal irritation. Sulfasalazine can reduce the incidence and severity of acute symptoms.​ [106] Topical corticosteroids by enema or suppository (e.g., Proctofoam). Symptomatic management of urgency, tenesmus or loose movements with antispasmodics and antidiarrheals. Sucralfate enemas for chronic proctitis with rectal bleeding.​ [107] Treatment interruption or discontinuation. Surgery for difficult-to-treat symptoms or when proctitis complications (e.g., fistulas) are present. |
| Taste alterations (dysgeusia) (within weeks to months or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Head and neck | There are no proven preventive measures. Avoidance of radiation to parotid glands.​ [108] ​ [109] | Experiment with foods; monitor nutritional intake. Alleviate dry mouth to improve taste. Refer for dietary counselling.​ [109] |
| Xerostomia (dry mouth, thickened or absent saliva secretion) (during treatment to within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Head and neck | Avoid unnecessary irradiation of salivary glands. Use oral lubricants or artificial saliva, sugarless gum or popsicles, ice cubes or water intake to moisten mouth. Avoid excess alcohol intake and tobacco use. | Oral lubricants or artificial saliva preparations. Pilocarpine stimulates saliva production if there is residual salivary function. Stringent oral hygiene is paramount to prevent dental caries and oral infection. Sugary foods and drinks should be avoided.​ [102] ​ [109] ​ [110] |
| Hematologic |
| Myelosuppression (within weeks to months) | Pelvis, total body |  | See Table 2 , Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia and Fatigue. |
| Musculoskeletal |
| Osteoradionecrosis (loss of bone structure in irradiated area accompanied by pain, purulent drainage, and possibly fistula formation between cutaneous and mucosal layers) (within months to years) | Head and neck | Full dental checkup with risk assessment and extraction of problematic teeth prior to radiation. Ideally wait a minimum 7–21 days after an extraction before initiating radiation. Avoid use of ill-fitting dentures or extensive dental extractions postradiation. Control xerostomia and maintain good oral hygiene. Advise on smoking cessation.​ [97] ​ [98] ​ [109] | Débridement and irrigation. Chlorhexidine rinses. Topical and oral antibiotics as well as analgesics may be required. Resection of affected areas. Hyperbaric oxygen is used, although supporting evidence remains limited.​ [97] ​ [98] ​ [109] ​ [111] ​ [112] |
| Trismus (inability to open mouth completely due to tonic contraction of muscles of mastication) (within weeks to months) | Head and neck | Early detection and treatment to prevent consequences of condition (poor intake or hygiene). Physical therapy to perform mechanical stretching of the muscles of mastication.​ [97] | Prevention is much more effective than treatment once trismus is developed. Mechanical devices to stretch muscles around mouth.​ [113] |
| Renal |
| Urinary frequency or dysuria (within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Assess for and avoid drug-related causes in patients at risk, e.g., older patients. | Treat symptomatically with anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin , tolterodine ) or alpha 1 -adrenergic antagonists (e.g., tamsulosin , doxazosin ). See Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Urinary Incontinence in Adults . Rule out infection. |
| Hemorrhagic cystitis (within months to years) | Pelvis | Limit amount of radiation exposure to the bladder if possible. | See Table 2 , Hemorrhagic cystitis. |
| Reproductive |
| Erectile dysfunction and reduced sexual function (within months or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Prevalent in all sexes during and after radiation therapy (can be months or years). Education and communication prior to its development may facilitate management. | Penile implants, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil ), mechanical devices for erectile dysfunction. Vaginal dilators and lubricants.​ [114] ​ [115] See Table 2 , Sexual changes. |
| Gonadal toxicity | Pelvis, craniospinal | Sperm, oocyte or embryo banking. Ovarian or testicular shielding, surgical transposition may be considered. | See Table 2 , Gonadal toxicity. |
| Vaginal irritation (within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Educate patients on the importance of vaginal dilatation methods. See Female Sexual Dysfunction . | Water-soluble lubricant, vaginal dilators. |
| Respiratory |
| Pneumonitis (cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fever) (within months to years) | Chest | Minimize risk and severity by limiting the area of the lung that is irradiated.​ [116] Pentoxifylline has demonstrated benefit in preventing early and late toxicities.​ [117] | Prednisone (starting dose of 1 mg/kg/day PO, taper over weeks) or dexamethasone (16–20 mg/day). Identify and manage any concurrent infection. |
| Other |
| Carcinogenesis (basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, others) (within years) | Cervix, chest, oral cavity, pharynx, testes and others | Reduce risk by using modern radiation techniques to limit radiation doses and the volume of normal tissue exposed; regular screening where indicated, e.g., mammography for breast cancer in patients receiving high-dose radiation to the chest. | Cancer specific. |
| Pain flare (within days to weeks) | At area of radiation to the bone | Prophylaxis with a brief course of dexamethasone initiated prior to start of radiation reduces incidence and severity of pain flare.​ [118] ​ [119] | Pain management with nonpharmacologic and systemic analgesics, including opioids and NSAID s . |
