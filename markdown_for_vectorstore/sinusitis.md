### Introduction

Rhinosinusitis, more commonly known as sinusitis, is defined as symptomatic inflammation of one or more of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity (see [Figure 1](#SinusesImage)).​[[1]](#Rosenfeld2015) This chapter focuses on **acute rhinosinusitis** in children and adults, which includes episodes lasting ≤4 weeks. By comparison:​[[2]](#c0090n00231)

- Chronic rhinosinusitis: refers to symptomatic inflammation that lasts ≥12 weeks and may be associated with acute exacerbations
- Subacute rhinosinusitis: refers to episodes lasting between 4 and 12 weeks
- Recurrent rhinosinusitis: defined as ≥4 discrete episodes of acute rhinosinusitis per year, without symptoms in between

Acute rhinosinusitis is further categorized as bacterial or viral.​[[3]](#Aring2016)

Most episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). These viruses, most commonly rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus and parainfluenza virus, induce a local inflammatory response​[[4]](#Orlandi2021)​[[5]](#Jaume2020) characterized by edema, mucus production and sinus obstruction.​[[6]](#Fokkens2020) In a small number of cases, this facilitates bacterial invasion of the paranasal sinuses. It is estimated that viral URTI is complicated by bacterial rhinosinusitis in only 0.5–2% of adult cases and 6–13% of cases in children.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[7]](#c0090n00022)​[[8]](#c0090n00023)​[[9]](#c0090n00024)​[[10]](#c0090n00025)​[[11]](#c0090n00026)

Although rare in healthy individuals (i.e., 1 in 12 000 children or 1 in 32 000 adults), acute rhinosinusitis can lead to complicated disease including:​[[4]](#Orlandi2021)

- Orbital complications (e.g., preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess): most frequently occurring complications; more likely to occur in children than in adults
- Intracranial complications (e.g., epidural or subdural abscesses, brain abscess, meningitis, or superior sagittal or cavernous sinus thrombosis): more likely to occur in adults <40 years of age
- Osseous complications (e.g., osteomyelitis of the frontal bone): least likely to occur

Since the rate of complications is similar in patients who are treated with antibiotics and in those who are not, antimicrobial therapy does not play a role in their prevention.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[12]](#Babar-Craig2010)​[[13]](#Hansen2012)​[[14]](#Skow2023)

### Goals of Therapy

- Reduce symptoms of rhinosinusitis
- Eradicate infection
- Prevent recurrence
- Minimize unnecessary antibiotic use to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance

### Investigations

The diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis relies on patient history with or without physical examination. In patients who do not present with features suggestive of complicated disease, additional investigations are not needed.​[[6]](#Fokkens2020) An assessment and management algorithm for patients with acute rhinosinusitis is presented in [Figure 2](#AssMGMT).

In adults, acute rhinosinusitis is characterized by the onset of anterior and/or posterior purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, blockage, and congestion; facial pain (particularly when bending forward), pressure, and fullness; and/or a reduced or lost sense of smell.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[6]](#Fokkens2020)​[[15]](#NICE_sinusitis) The mnemonic **PODS** can be used to help remember these symptoms:​[[16]](#Kaplan2014)

- Facial **P**ain
- Nasal **O**bstruction
- Purulent nasal **D**ischarge
- **S**mell disorder

Posterior rhinoscopy may reveal nasal inflammation, mucosal edema or purulent discharge, while physical findings can include sinus tenderness on palpation. Patients may also experience sore throat, cough, malaise, tooth pain and/or fever.

Children with acute rhinosinusitis will often present with sudden onset of 2 or more of: discoloured nasal drainage; nasal obstruction, blockage, and congestion; and/or cough (day or night).​[[6]](#Fokkens2020)

In order to differentiate acute rhinosinusitis from allergic rhinitis, patients should be asked about the presence of sneezing, watery rhinorrhea or eyes, and nasal or ocular pruritis. Sinus pain or headache in the absence of nasal symptoms should prompt consideration of dental disease or headache syndrome.​[[4]](#Orlandi2021) Physical examination should seek to rule out complications (see [Table 1](#redflags)), which tend to occur early in the course of the illness and are associated with severe symptoms.​[[6]](#Fokkens2020) Patients in whom a complication is suspected may require radiographic imaging (e.g., sinus x-ray, CT, MRI) or endoscopically guided culture of sinus aspirate.​[[17]](#c0090n00266)

**Table 1:** Red Flags—Symptoms Associated with Complicated Disease​[[4]](#Orlandi2021)[[6]](#Fokkens2020)

| Altered mental status Conjunctival or periorbital edema Exophthalmos (displaced globe) Eyelid drop Impaired visual acuity or double vision Nausea and/or vomiting Neck stiffness | Ocular pain or tenderness Ophthalmoplegia (weakness/paralysis of the eye muscle) Restricted or painful movement of extraocular muscles Severe, intractable headache Swelling over the frontal bone Systemically very unwell |

Differentiating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from acute viral rhinosinusitis is challenging given the significant degree of symptom overlap. No individual symptom is diagnostic of bacterial involvement (e.g., fever also occurs in viral infection; the colour of nasal discharge reflects the presence of neutrophils rather than bacteria).​[[2]](#c0090n00231) However, accurate identification of patients with bacterial infection is crucial to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and subsequent development of antimicrobial resistance.

Given the limited value of symptoms in differentiating bacterial from viral rhinosinusitis, clinicians are advised to rely on the time course of the illness to determine the likelihood of bacterial involvement. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed in patients in whom symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis persist without evidence of improvement for >10 days after the start of URTI symptoms or where symptoms of rhinosinusitis get worse within 10 days after an initial period of improvement (i.e., “double sickening”).​[[2]](#c0090n00231) For more information, see [Figure 2](#AssMGMT).

Additional investigations are of limited practical value in differentiating bacterial versus viral infection. Although studies of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis often use sinus culture to identify bacterial infection, direct aspiration of the paranasal sinuses is rarely performed in routine clinical practice, particularly in uncomplicated primary care cases.​[[4]](#Orlandi2021) Nasal swabs are expected to be contaminated by normal flora, and results cannot be used to predict pathogens in the sinus cavity.​[[18]](#c0090n00296) Similarly, radiography is unable to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections and is not recommended.​[[19]](#Kirsch2017)​[[20]](#ChoosingWisely2024) Although point-of-care testing could improve diagnostic accuracy, the identification and validation of reliable biomarkers for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are still ongoing and thus cannot be recommended.​[[21]](#AutioTJ-FDA5B4AF)​[[22]](#CarltonHC-FDA5E136)

### Prevention​[[23]](#c0090n00021)​[[24]](#c0090n00232)

- Limit the spread of viral infections. Under normal circumstances, handwashing effectively prevents the spread of infection;​[[25]](#c0090n00267) however, in a viral epidemic situation (e.g., COVID-19), additional interventions such as physical distancing and the use of face masks may be needed.​[[5]](#Jaume2020)
- Avoid exposure to environmental irritants, especially tobacco smoke.
- Reduce allergen exposure.

### Therapeutic Choices

An assessment and management algorithm for patients with acute rhinosinusitis is presented in [Figure 2](#AssMGMT).

### Nonpharmacologic Choices

- Treatment with saline nasal irrigation may be of benefit in acute rhinosinusitis to thin mucus, clear inflammatory mediators, improve mucociliary function, and moisturize dry, inflamed nasal mucosae.​[[26]](#King-991E836E)​[[27]](#Gallant2018)​[[28]](#Cabaillot2020)

  There is no clear evidence that one method of saline nasal irrigation is superior to another; however, one study in adults found that large-volume irrigation (i.e., 250 mL) was more effective at improving rhinorrhea and postnasal drip compared with small-volume syringe (i.e., 10 mL).​[[4]](#Orlandi2021)
- Although there are no scientific data on efficacy, the following comfort measures may be helpful in relieving symptoms in some patients:​[[23]](#c0090n00021)

  - adequate rest and hydration
  - warm facial packs/compresses
  - head of the bed elevated while sleeping

### Pharmacologic Choices

### Principles of Therapy in Acute Rhinosinusitis

Given that the majority of episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are viral in nature, most patients are unlikely to experience any benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The presence of coloured nasal discharge is poorly correlated with bacterial involvement; antimicrobial efficacy is the same regardless of clear or coloured discharge.​[[29]](#Shaikh2023) Approximately 70% of cases of acute rhinosinusitis will resolve within 2 weeks without antibiotic treatment.​[[30]](#c0090n00043)​[[31]](#c0090n00044)​[[32]](#c0090n00045)​[[33]](#c0090n00206)​[[34]](#c0090n00208) In patients clinically diagnosed with acute rhinosinusitis, 19 people need to be treated with antimicrobial therapy in order for 1 person to experience faster cure (number needed to treat [NNT] = 19), while only 8 need to receive antibiotics for an individual to experience side effects (number needed to harm [NNH] = 8).​[[35]](#Lemiengre2018) Furthermore, given that complications are rare and antibiotics do not appear to prevent them, using antimicrobial therapy for the purpose of preventing complications is not routinely necessary.​[[6]](#Fokkens2020) Patients who have symptoms that suggest complicated disease (see [Table 1](#redflags)) require further evaluation and, likely, antimicrobial therapy.

Symptom management only is the preferred initial strategy for patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[15]](#NICE_sinusitis)​[[36]](#Arnstead2020) Antimicrobial therapy can be considered in patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (e.g., symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis that persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days; symptoms that get worse after an initial period of improvement). However, even in patients suspected of having bacterial involvement, antibiotics at the time of diagnosis may not be necessary. In a meta-analysis reviewing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children diagnosed according to these criteria, the NNT with antibacterial therapy to prevent 1 additional case of treatment failure was 6.​[[37]](#ConwaySJ-FDA841FB) Offering antimicrobial therapy at the time of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis diagnosis should be considered for patients experiencing significant impact on quality of life due to severity of symptoms (e.g., interfering with activity or sleep).​[[17]](#c0090n00266) Clinicians must weigh the potential benefits of antimicrobial therapy on symptom duration with the risk of adverse effects and the impact on patients’ microbiomes and population-level antimicrobial resistance.

A trial of intranasal corticosteroids or **watchful waiting** with or without a rescue prescription are 2 strategies that may minimize antimicrobial use in the setting of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

- Patients with mild-to-moderate (i.e., occasional or steady but easily tolerated) symptoms may experience modest benefit from the use of an **intranasal corticosteroid** spray, thereby avoiding the need for antibiotics. If there is no improvement in symptoms after 72 hours, addition of antibiotics should be considered.​[[16]](#Kaplan2014)​[[17]](#c0090n00266)​[[36]](#Arnstead2020)
- A watchful-waiting strategy (i.e., deferring antibiotics for up to 7 days after diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis while providing symptom management) in appropriately selected patients is safe and effective.​[[38]](#DeLaPoza2016)​[[39]](#Little2014) This strategy is recommended only in situations where reassessment is guaranteed if the illness persists or worsens.​[[2]](#c0090n00231) Some clinicians may choose to provide these patients with a rescue prescription at the time of diagnosis, with instructions to start antibiotics only when symptoms fail to improve within 7 days or if they worsen at any time. This delayed-prescribing strategy is associated with decreased antibiotic use (compared with immediate prescribing) and avoids the cost and inconvenience of another assessment. However, it is not associated with improved patient outcomes and may reinforce patients’ perceptions that antibiotics are needed for acute rhinosinusitis.​[[40]](#Spurling2023)

Ultimately, shared decision-making with patients is needed when choosing whether or not to start antimicrobial therapy at any time and must take into consideration the self-limiting nature of the illness, the low incidence of complications and the risks associated with antimicrobial therapy, including antimicrobial resistance, increased prescription costs, drug allergy, side effects and Clostridioides difficile infection.​[[15]](#NICE_sinusitis)​[[35]](#Lemiengre2018)​[[41]](#Shehab2008) For more information, see [Table 2](#TalkingPoints).

For a patient-specific infographic related to the benefits and risks of antibiotic use for sinusitis, see [Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/i/2018/infographic-lets-talk-sinus-infection.pdf?la=en).

**Table 2:** Talking Points When Patients Request Antibiotics for Acute Rhinosinusitis​​[[a]](#afn66981)

| Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by a virus. Antibiotics do not kill viruses; they kill bacteria. Even the majority of cases caused by bacteria get better without antibiotics. Fewer than 1% of patients with acute rhinosinusitis need antibiotics to get better. There are no symptoms that can be used to predict if bacteria are causing your acute rhinosinusitis. Coloured nasal discharge is due to the presence of white blood cells and is present in both viral and bacterial infection. Regardless of the cause, acute rhinosinusitis is unlikely to result in complications. Taking antibiotics when they’re not needed can be harmful: Antibiotics commonly cause unpleasant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less often, antibiotics cause serious side effects including allergic reactions and secondary infections like C. difficile colitis. Antibiotics are responsible for almost 1 out of every 5 emergency room visits for adverse drug events. Antibiotics increase antibiotic resistance, which makes it harder to treat infections in the future. Acute viral infections tend to improve within 1 week , but complete improvement can take up to 3 weeks . |

[a] Note: patient satisfaction does not depend on receiving an antibiotic; it is related to the quality of communication between the primary-care provider and the patient.​[[42]](#Harris2016)

### Symptom Management

Information about the medications used to manage the symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis can be found in [Table 4](#c0090n00019x).

**Analgesics/antipyretics** such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) can be used for control of pain and/or fever associated with acute rhinosinusitis. Routine use (rather than as needed) for the first 24–48 hours following diagnosis may help to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use.

The use of intranasal corticosteroids **(INCS**; e.g., budesonide, fluticasone **propionate**, mometasone) in acute rhinosinusitis may provide a small benefit.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[4]](#Orlandi2021) In a meta-analysis of 4 double-blind, randomized controlled studies of patients with acute rhinosinusitis, the overall rate of resolution or marked improvement of symptoms was 73% versus 66% in corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively.​[[43]](#c0090n00329) In other words, for every 100 patients treated with INCS, only 7 additional patients had complete or marked symptom relief. Despite this modest benefit, some experts advocate the use of INCS as an antibiotic-sparing measure in mild-to-moderate cases.​[[17]](#c0090n00266)​[[36]](#Arnstead2020)​[[44]](#Snidvongs2017) When the decision is made to use INCS, high-dose regimens (equivalent to mometasone 400 mcg/day) should be used, as lower doses are no better than placebo.​[[43]](#c0090n00329) Clinicians should weigh the modest benefit of INCS against their cost and environmental impact, though some patients may still opt for treatment, especially if they wish to potentially reduce their use of antibiotics.

Although oral and nasal **decongestants** are commonly used, there are currently no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of decongestants in patients with acute rhinosinusitis.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[6]](#Fokkens2020)​[[15]](#NICE_sinusitis)​[[45]](#c0090n00031) Use oral decongestants for symptom relief with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention or in those taking MAO inhibitors. Treatment with topical decongestant sprays should be limited to 3–5 days; extended use may result in rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion/hyperemia), which may be refractory to subsequent decongestant therapy.​[[23]](#c0090n00021)

The efficacy and safety of nasal/oral decongestants have not been well studied in pediatric patients <12 years of age.​[[46]](#Wald2013)​[[47]](#DeckxLxa0DeSutterAIMxa0GuoLxa0MirNA-9892EA8F) Adverse events resulting in emergency room visits due to the use and/or misuse of oral cough and cold preparations are highest among children <6 years of age.​[[48]](#c0090n00229) In addition, overdose of oral cough and cold preparations, specifically pseudoephedrine, has been associated with death in several infants.​[[49]](#c0090n00219) As a result, Health Canada issued an advisory in December 2008 instructing caregivers not to give certain nonprescription cough and cold medications (including decongestants) to children <6 years of age.​[[50]](#c0090n00230) Some clinicians further advise against their use in children <12 years of age.​[[47]](#DeckxLxa0DeSutterAIMxa0GuoLxa0MirNA-9892EA8F) Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of these medications before recommending. In order to avoid overdose from multiple medications (including analgesic products) that contain the same ingredients, assess for the use of other cough and cold preparations.

Based on the lack of evidence of efficacy and their potential harms, oral/systemic corticosteroids are not recommended in acute rhinosinusitis.​[[6]](#Fokkens2020)​[[51]](#Venekamp2014)

There is limited evidence to support the use of antihistamines in acute rhinosinusitis.​[[52]](#Seresirikachorn2018) Furthermore, their use is associated with excessive dryness, thickened secretions and crusting.​[[53]](#c0090n00036)

There is no evidence that mucolytics such as guaifenesin or cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan are useful adjuncts in acute rhinosinusitis.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[23]](#c0090n00021)

### Antibiotic Therapy

Information about antibiotic therapy can be found in [Table 3](#empiric-children-n99010) and [Table 5](#c0090n00019).

Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacteria isolated in children and adults with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis; these are listed in [Table 3](#empiric-children-n99010).​[[23]](#c0090n00021)​[[54]](#BrookI2011)

When antimicrobial therapy is indicated, the patient’s medication history should be reviewed. Treatment with an antibiotic in the previous 3 months is a risk factor for infection with S. pneumoniae that is resistant to that class of agent, particularly for macrolides and fluoroquinolones. If this is the case, select a different class of antibiotic.​[[55]](#LeekhaSTerrellCLEdsonRS.GeneralPrin-CE910E2E)​[[56]](#HoPLTseWSTsangKWEtAl.RiskFactorsFor-CE9174D3)

Amoxicillin remains the first choice for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for the following reasons:​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[17]](#c0090n00266)​[[23]](#c0090n00021)​[[57]](#c0090n00020)​[[58]](#c0090n00038)​[[59]](#c0090n00033)

- Provides suitable coverage for organisms most often involved in acute rhinosinusitis
- Exhibits best activity of all oral beta-lactam agents against S. pneumoniae, including strains with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin (when high-dose amoxicillin is used)
- No other antibiotics have been shown to be superior to it in clinical trials
- Has lower potential to induce resistance compared with other antibiotic classes (e.g., macrolides)
- Causes relatively few adverse effects
- Is relatively inexpensive

Although the 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology’s clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis recommends either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/​clavulanate as first-line therapy,​[[2]](#c0090n00231) experts continue to recommend amoxicillin as first line because amoxicillin/clavulanate is more broad spectrum than amoxicillin, has increased potential for adverse effects, is more expensive and has a similar risk of treatment failure.​[[17]](#c0090n00266)​[[60]](#Savage-FDA8A3F9) For more information, see [Failure of First-Line Therapy](#c0090n00180).

There are no clinically significant differences in outcomes among first-line and second-line broader spectrum antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones.​[[33]](#c0090n00206)​[[34]](#c0090n00208)​[[61]](#c0090n00209)​[[62]](#c0090n00210)​[[63]](#c0090n00243)​[[64]](#c0090n00244)

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP), cephalexin, cefadroxil and cefixime are not recommended for empiric monotherapy of rhinosinusitis due to their unpredictable/poor activity against S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae.

Although macrolides are frequently used in the treatment of rhinosinusitis, their routine use cannot be recommended because:

- Azithromycin and clarithromycin have inferior coverage of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the 2 most common pathogens in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
- There is a higher rate of resistance to macrolides than to amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate, especially with S. pneumoniae; macrolide resistance cannot be overcome with higher doses.
- In most Canadian jurisdictions, the risk of doxycycline resistance in S. pneumoniae is less than the risk of macrolide resistance.
- Macrolides have been shown to be less efficacious than amoxicillin/clavulanate for treatment of acute otitis media, which has similar microbiology to acute rhinosinusitis.

##### Penicillin Allergy

Patients who report allergy to penicillin should undergo a thorough allergy assessment. While there are alternatives available for patients who are truly allergic, over-reporting of penicillin allergy is frequent and these patients are more likely to receive less effective, more harmful and possibly more expensive second-line therapies.​[[65]](#Sacco2017)​[[66]](#Macy2014)​[[67]](#Blumenthal2018) For patients with true penicillin allergy, doxycycline has excellent activity against rhinosinusitis pathogens, such as beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-intermediate strains. Although previously only recommended in children >8 years of age, doxycycline can be given without regard to age, based on more recent data suggesting that it is unlikely to affect tooth enamel if given for short courses (i.e., ≤21 days).​[[68]](#RedBook) The use of doxycycline in pregnancy is not well supported by high-quality evidence; while significant harm has not been clearly demonstrated, the lack of robust safety data means it is generally avoided unless no safer alternatives are available.​[[69]](#Cross2016) For patients with penicillin allergy who are unable to take doxycycline, a cephalosporin may be used; patients who have true IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins (including anaphylaxis) may be safely treated with cefuroxime, which does not share a side-chain with any penicillin.​[[70]](#AHS2017)​[[71]](#NB_ABX)​[[72]](#Novalbos2001)

### Failure of First-Line Therapy

Amoxicillin/​clavulanate offers the most appropriate spectrum of activity and is the agent of choice when first-line antibiotic therapy fails (i.e., no improvement after 7 days of antibiotic therapy, clinical deterioration or recurrence within 3 months).​[[34]](#c0090n00208)​[[58]](#c0090n00038) Patients who have failed a course of appropriately dosed amoxicillin may be more likely to have infection caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The addition of clavulanate provides excellent activity against these pathogens.

While levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have good coverage of the pathogens involved, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients with severe, documented allergy to beta-lactams who have failed first-line antibiotic therapy for the following reasons:

- They have a broad spectrum in comparison with first-line amoxicillin.
- They have the potential to increase resistance.
- They carry a greater risk of C. difficile infection.
- There is an increased incidence of persistent and disabling side effects, including tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy and neuropsychiatric effects.​[[73]](#HealthCanada.SummarySafetyReview-Fl-9898D395)​[[74]](#U.SFoodAndDrugAdministration.FDANew-9898D06B)

Due to the fact that the risk of serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, Health Canada and the US FDA have determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with this condition who have no alternative treatment options.​[[73]](#HealthCanada.SummarySafetyReview-Fl-9898D395)​[[74]](#U.SFoodAndDrugAdministration.FDANew-9898D06B)

### Duration of Antibiotic Therapy

Optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is not well defined, but most patients can receive a 5-day course of therapy. Traditionally, anywhere from a 7- to 14-day course of therapy has been recommended.​[[23]](#c0090n00021)​[[24]](#c0090n00232)​[[57]](#c0090n00020)​[[75]](#c0090n00263) However, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials compared short-course (3–7 days) therapy to longer courses (6–10 days) with the same antibiotic at the same dose in acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis and found no differences in clinical success, microbiologic efficacy, relapses, adverse events or withdrawals.​[[76]](#FalagasMEKarageorgopoulosDEGrammati-A143C258) In a subanalysis of 7 trials that compared 5-day with 10-day regimens, clinical success was similar but adverse events were fewer with the 5-day course of therapy.

Some prescribers continue antibiotic therapy until the patient is free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 days to ensure eradication of bacteria and to prevent relapse;​[[23]](#c0090n00021)​[[59]](#c0090n00033) however, this is not recommended, as short-course optimal dose therapy has been shown to be effective in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanate​[[77]](#c0090n00246) or respiratory quinolones​[[78]](#c0090n00040)​[[79]](#c0090n00248)​[[80]](#c0090n00249) for 5 days.

In adults with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis, a shorter treatment duration of 5–7 days is recommended and has advantages in terms of lower potential for development of resistance, better adherence, fewer adverse events and lower costs.​[[18]](#c0090n00296)​[[58]](#c0090n00038)​[[76]](#FalagasMEKarageorgopoulosDEGrammati-A143C258)​[[81]](#c0090n00213) If first-line therapy has failed, choose a different antibiotic and treat for 5–10 days with the new agent (see [Table 3](#empiric-children-n99010)).​[[18]](#c0090n00296)​[[58]](#c0090n00038)

For children, data on shorter durations of therapy are lacking; therefore, it is still recommended to treat for 10 days.​[[18]](#c0090n00296)​[[58]](#c0090n00038)

### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

### Acute Rhinosinusitis and Pregnancy

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause temporary nasal congestion and symptoms that mimic rhinosinusitis due to vasodilation and increased blood volume.​[[24]](#c0090n00232)​[[83]](#c0090n00234) Symptoms of this condition, pregnancy rhinitis *de novo*, usually disappear within 2 weeks after delivery.​[[83]](#c0090n00234)

Hormone-induced nasal congestion and pregnancy-related immunosuppression may predispose pregnant people to bacterial rhinosinusitis, which has been reported to be as high as 1.5% in pregnancy, representing a 6-fold increase over the incidence observed in a nonpregnant population.​[[84]](#c0090n00255) The peak onset is in the second trimester. Classic signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis are absent in nearly half of patients with documented purulent rhinosinusitis during pregnancy.​[[84]](#c0090n00255)

Uncontrolled rhinosinusitis during pregnancy may aggravate coexisting asthma and can have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome and quality of life. Therefore, rhinosinusitis during pregnancy should be actively evaluated and treated to optimize pregnancy outcome.​[[84]](#c0090n00255)

### Management of Acute Rhinosinusitis in Pregnancy

Nonpharmacologic measures such as saline nasal irrigation​[[84]](#c0090n00255) should be tried first. Acetaminophen can be used if an analgesic or antipyretic is necessary. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are an alternative to acetaminophen but are not recommended in the second half of pregnancy. Concerns regarding the use of NSAIDs include the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosis if used in the third trimester​[[85]](#KorenG) as well as kidney dysfunction leading to low amniotic fluid levels if used ≥20 weeks’ gestation.​[[86]](#NSAIDPreg)

As in the nonpregnant population, there is no evidence to support the use of decongestants for symptom management of acute rhinosinusitis during pregnancy.​[[2]](#c0090n00231)​[[6]](#Fokkens2020)​[[15]](#NICE_sinusitis)​[[45]](#c0090n00031) If used, **topical** decongestants are preferred over **oral decongestants** to lessen fetal drug exposure. Since pregnant patients have a tendency to develop rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion), likely due to hormonally induced congestion, topical decongestants should be used minimally (e.g., before bedtime to help with sleep) for no more than 3–5 days, preferably after the first trimester and not during labour.​[[84]](#c0090n00255) Oral decongestants should be avoided in the first trimester because of a possible risk of gastroschisis, i.e., a rare birth defect involving the abdominal wall.​[[83]](#c0090n00234)​[[87]](#c0090n00260) There is no specific information available on the use of intranasal corticosteroids for acute rhinosinusitis during pregnancy, but very little (if any) would be expected to reach the fetus during maternal intranasal use because these drugs are poorly absorbed and undergo first-pass metabolism.​[[84]](#c0090n00255)

As in the general population, amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in pregnancy.​[[88]](#LalDJategaonkarAABorishLEtAl.Manage-A373368F) When amoxicillin has failed, amoxicillin/​clavulanate is safe to use in pregnancy. For pregnant patients exhibiting a type I IgE-mediated allergy or nonsevere type IV delayed rash to penicillin, cefuroxime is an appropriate alternative, although it is expected to be less effective against S. pneumoniae than amoxicillin. For patients who are unable to take any beta-lactams, azithromycin is recommended, recognizing the risk of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae in many Canadian jurisdictions.​[[84]](#c0090n00255)

Fluoroquinolones should be avoided in pregnancy, as safer alternatives are usually available. Impaired cartilage development has been reported in animal studies, although there have been no reports suggesting an increased risk of major malformations, adverse effects in the fetal musculoskeletal system, spontaneous abortions, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction or postnatal disorders.​[[89]](#c0090n00257)​[[90]](#c0090n00258)​[[91]](#c0090n00259)​[[92]](#c0090n00265) Doxycycline is associated with tooth discoloration in the fetus and should not be used during pregnancy. Clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim should be avoided, particularly during the first trimester, as these are associated with increased risk for miscarriage and neural tube defects, respectively.​[[93]](#Carroll2018)

### Management of Rhinosinusitis while Breastfeeding

As in pregnancy, nonpharmacologic measures such as saline nasal irrigation​[[84]](#c0090n00255) are preferred first-line measures in breastfeeding patients.

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used if an analgesic or antipyretic is necessary.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia)

Topical decongestants such as oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and phenylephrine are considered safe in breastfeeding when used for no more than 3–5 days.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia) Topical agents are preferred over **oral** decongestants to lessen drug exposure to the newborn. Patients who are breastfeeding should be exceedingly cautious if using oral decongestants, as reduced milk production has been reported. If oral decongestants are needed, only short-acting forms should be used and are best taken just after breastfeeding to minimize drug levels in breast milk.​[[94]](#Lactmed) With topical or oral decongestant use, watch for signs of toxicity in the infant such as irritability, nervousness, insomnia or excitation.​[[84]](#c0090n00255) These products should not be used during breastfeeding of infants with hypertension or cardiac syndromes.

INCS are considered safe while breastfeeding since only very small doses are used, intranasal absorption is minimal and there is rapid first-pass metabolism by the liver. Therefore, it is unlikely that these products pose any risk to the breastfed infant.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia)

Amoxicillin and amoxicillin/​clavulanate are considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia) For breastfeeding patients who cannot take amoxicillin, cefuroxime or a **macrolide** (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) can be used.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia)​[[96]](#Chung2002) Caution is advised with doxycycline, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin; if used, avoid repeated or prolonged exposure.​[[94]](#Lactmed)​[[95]](#eLactancia) With any antibiotic, observe the breastfed infant for thrush, rash and GI symptoms such as diarrhea.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Therapeutic Tips

- Most episodes of acute rhinosinusitis last 2–3 weeks and resolve without antibiotic therapy, even when there is bacterial involvement.
- The preferred approach to patients with acute rhinosinusitis is symptom management without antibiotics. Patients should be reassured that serious complications are rare and that withholding antibiotics is not associated with harm. Patients should understand that they are more likely to experience a side effect from antibiotic therapy than they are to experience benefit.
- Patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (e.g., symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis that persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days; symptoms that get worse after an initial period of improvement) can consider starting antimicrobial therapy immediately or take an antibiotic-sparing approach (i.e., a trial of INCS or watchful waiting).
- In **adults** with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis where antibiotics are indicated, a treatment duration of 5–7 days is recommended.
- For **children**, data on shorter durations of therapy are lacking; therefore, it is still recommended to treat for 10 days.​[[18]](#c0090n00296)​[[58]](#c0090n00038)
- Inform patients that improvement may take up to 7 days and complete resolution of symptoms may take up to 21 days. Improvement, not resolution, of symptoms within 7 days should be used as the basis for determining treatment efficacy.
- If the patient deteriorates at any time, reassess for acute complications (see [Table 1](#redflags)), other diagnoses and/or adherence to treatment.
- Routine follow-up on completion of therapy in asymptomatic patients is not required.
- If a patient has received antibiotics (especially macrolides or fluoroquinolones) within the past 3 months, choose a different antibiotic class to treat acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, as there is a higher risk of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae.​[[55]](#LeekhaSTerrellCLEdsonRS.GeneralPrin-CE910E2E)​[[56]](#HoPLTseWSTsangKWEtAl.RiskFactorsFor-CE9174D3)
- Refer to ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if a patient:

  - fails second-line therapy​[[57]](#c0090n00020)
  - experiences 4 or more episodes of bacterial rhinosinusitis per year
  - has anatomic anomalies
  - develops complications (see [Table 1](#redflags))

High-dose amoxicillin should be used in children at high risk of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae : age <2 years ; recent (<3 months) antibiotic exposure and/or daycare centre attendance. |
| amoxicillin /​ clavulanate Clavulin , generics Tabs: < $10 Susp: $20–30 | Adults: 875 mg BID PO Children: amoxicillin/clavulanate (7:1) 45 mg/kg/day (amoxicillin component) divided BID–TID PO ± additional amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/day divided BID–TID PO (see Comments) | Nausea, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhea​ [c] more common than with amoxicillin alone. | Penicillins may increase serum concentration of methotrexate and decrease serum concentration of the active metabolite of mycophenolate. Tetracyclines may decrease the therapeutic effect of penicillins. | If patient has failed standard-dose amoxicillin, combine amoxicillin/clavulanate with amoxicillin to increase the total dose of amoxicillin while minimizing diarrhea due to the clavulanate. If patient has failed high-dose amoxicillin therapy, amoxicillin/clavulanate alone is adequate to cover beta-lactamase-producing organisms. |

**Drug Class: Tetracyclines**

| doxycycline generics < $10 | Adults: 200 mg × 1 dose PO, then 100 mg BID PO Children: 4 mg/kg/day divided BID PO; maximum 200 mg/day | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,​ [c] rash, photosensitivity. | May increase warfarin effect. May increase digoxin levels. Doxycycline seems to be minimally affected by food and dairy products as compared with tetracycline. Aluminum, bismuth, iron and magnesium decrease absorption. Alcohol, carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital may decrease doxycycline concentrations. | Excellent activity against rhinosinusitis pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis ; S. pneumoniae , including penicillin-intermediate strains. Less resistance to doxycycline than to macrolides in S. pneumoniae . Doxycycline has not been associated with causing an increase in penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae (macrolides have). Excellent pharmacokinetics/dynamics (high serum levels, concentration-dependent killing). |

[[a]](#fnsrc_drufnad1039241e3398) Costs are given for a 5- to 7-day course of treatment for adults and for a 10–day course of treatment for children based on 20 kg body weight; includes drug cost only.

[[b]](#fnsrc_drufnbd1039241e3401) Information on duration of treatment can be found in [Table 3](#empiric-children-n99010).

[c] Antibiotic-associated diarrhea/colitis is commonly associated with clindamycin and beta-lactams, but any antibiotic can cause this condition.
