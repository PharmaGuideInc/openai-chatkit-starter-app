#### Introduction

Previously known as pressure ulcers, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bedsores, pressure injury is now the preferred term, as it reflects the fact that the injured skin may be intact or open, depending on the stage of the injury (see Table 1).​[^[1]]

A **pressure injury (PI)** is localized damage to the skin and/or underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure or pressure in combination with shear. The injured area may present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be painful. The tolerance of soft tissue for pressure and shear may be affected by microclimate, nutrition, perfusion and comorbidities.

**Medical device–related PIs** are those resulting from the use of devices applied to the patient for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, generally conforming to the pattern and shape of the device.

**Mucosal membrane PIs** are those occurring on a mucous membrane in a location where a medical device was used. Due to the anatomy of the tissue, these injuries cannot be staged.

Prevalence estimates for PIs in Canadian health-care settings range from 15–30%,​[^[4]] the majority of which are designated preventable by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute.​[^[5]] The cost of treatment of a PI acquired in hospital was estimated to be CA$44,000 for a stage 2 injury, increasing to CA$90,000 for a stage 4 injury in one study.​[^[6]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Prevention

#### Assessments

Pressure injuries can develop quickly and be a challenge to heal, making determination of the patients who are most vulnerable to them crucial to ensuring cost-effective allocation of resources for prevention. This can be achieved by:



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pressure Relief

Pressure and shear forces on bony prominences are the main cause of PI: pressure relief is the cornerstone of both prevention and treatment. External pressure is concentrated over bony prominences. If the external pressure applied to tissue is higher than the capillary closing pressure, there is occlusion of the blood vessels, decreased perfusion and tissue necrosis. PIs in subdermal tissues under bony prominences likely occur between 1 hour and 4–6 hours after sustained tissue loading.​[^[11]] Less pressure is required to create tissue ischemia in patients with impaired circulation secondary to disease process or injury, in patients receiving vasopressors, and in patients with conditions resulting in impaired oxygenation or perfusion.​[^[12]] Repositioning, support surfaces and consideration for medical devices all play important roles in achieving pressure relief.

###### Repositioning

Implement a repositioning schedule to protect intact skin.​[^[8]] Avoid placing weight directly on bony prominences.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] There is a lack of robust evidence regarding optimal position and frequency of repositioning.​[^[15]] Experts recommend encouraging patients with enough mobility to shift position frequently and repositioning patients who cannot do so themselves every 2–4 hours while in bed (taking overall condition, tolerance, level of mobility and support surface into consideration) and every 15 minutes while sitting. Limiting elevation of the head to 30 degrees or less if medically feasible is also recommended.​[^[8]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]

###### Support Surfaces

Patients at high risk of developing a PI should not remain on a standard mattress;​[^[8]]​[^[16]] however, there is no clear benefit of one specialized support surface over another.​[^[18]]

Commercially available surfaces are effective for pressure relief​[^[13]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]] and may be classed as *reactive* or *active*. A *reactive* support surface is a powered or nonpowered surface that changes load distribution in response to applied loads only. This includes mattresses or mattress overlays that are filled with air, water, gel, fluid, foam, or a combination of these, low air-loss mattresses, and air-fluidized mattresses. An *active* support surface is a powered surface that changes its load distribution with or without applied load. Only alternating-pressure mattresses fall into this category.​[^[13]]​[^[17]]​[^[21]]

###### Pressure-Relieving Devices

Use soft pillows or foam wedges between bony prominences such as knees and ankles, and to suspend heels above the mattress while the patient is in bed, independent of the support surface.​[^[8]]

Medical-grade sheepskin overlays have been shown to decrease the risk of developing a PI. Use of some pressure-relieving overlays on operating tables and in the post-operative period reduces the incidence of PI development postoperatively.​[^[18]] Donut seat cushions are not recommended.​[^[17]]

###### Consideration for Medical Devices

Avoid positioning the patient directly onto medical devices such as tubes or drainage systems. Remove devices that are potential sources of pressure as soon as medically feasible. Ensure the removal of slings that are not intended to be left under the patient after transfer. Inspect the skin under the medical devices regularly and keep it clean and dry.​[^[14]]

#### Preventive Skin Care

Keep the skin clean and adequately hydrated. Use nonalkaline soaps and cleansers and ensure prompt clean-up after episodes of incontinence. Protect the skin from moisture damage by using a barrier product.​[^[14]]

Some studies have assessed the effectiveness of applying topical preparations or dressings directly to the skin in attempt to prevent PI development. Interventions that have been shown to possibly be effective for prevention include silicone dressings applied directly to bony prominences and the application of fatty acid creams; however, the evidence is limited and of poor quality, and further study is needed.​[^[22]]

#### Nutrition

Assess patients who are at risk of developing a PI for malnutrition, and create and implement an individualized nutrition plan to ensure adequate nutrition.​[^[10]]

#### Treatment

#### Assessments

| --- |
| Pressure injuries do not necessarily progress in the order presented, nor do they heal by reverse staging. |
| Stage 1Nonblanchable erythema of intact skinIntact skin with a localized area of nonblanchable erythema. Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature or firmness may precede visual changes. In lighter skin tones, colour changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.Blanching may not be visible in darkly pigmented skin and its colour may differ from skin in the surrounding area.​[3] In darkly pigmented skin, look for changes in skin tone, temperature and tissue consistency compared to the adjacent skin. Colour changes may be more easily identified by moistening the skin.​[2] |  |
| Stage 2Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermisThe wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture-associated skin damage, including incontinence-associated dermatitis, intertriginous dermatitis, medical adhesive-related skin injury or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions). |  |
| Stage 3Full thickness skin lossAdipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue, and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop deep wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable PI. |  |
| Stage 4Full thickness skin and tissue lossExposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss, this is an unstageable PI. |  |
| UnstageableObscured full thickness skin and tissue lossThe extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar is removed, a stage 3 or stage 4 PI will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e., dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed. |  |
| Deep TissuePersistent nonblanchable deep red, maroon or purple discolorationIntact or nonintact skin with localized area of persistent nonblanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration (visible in lighter skin tones but may be very difficult to detect on darker skin​[3]) or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood-filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin colour changes. This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness PI (stage 3 or 4 or unstageable). Do not use deep tissue PI to describe vascular, traumatic, neuropathic or dermatologic conditions. |  |

#### Therapeutic Choices







#### Determining and Addressing the Cause of the Injury

PIs are caused by pressure and shear forces on bony prominences and/or placement of medical devices. Determination of the source of the pressure and relieving it is essential to allow interventions aimed at healing a PI to be effective. Addressing the cause of a PI is often enough to manage a stage 1 injury and prevent it from progressing to stage 2–4 (see Table 1).

###### Pressure Relief



#### Patient-Centred Concerns

In addition to determining and addressing the cause of the pressure injury, consider the following patient-centred concerns that play a significant role in creating optimal conditions for wound healing.

###### Nutrition

Implement an individualized nutrition plan to ensure adequate nutrition. Ascorbic acid, zinc and protein supplementation have been reported to improve wound healing; however, available evidence does not show a clear benefit of any nutritional supplementation for prevention or treatment of PIs.​[^[25]]

###### Smoking Cessation

Nicotine, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide are the main toxins in cigarette smoke that are associated with impaired wound healing. While the exact mechanism of delayed healing is not understood, all 3 substances impair tissue oxygenation.​[^[26]] Excessive smoking may also contribute to anorexia and ensuing malnutrition. Encourage all patients with PIs to quit smoking and refer them to appropriate smoking cessation programs. See Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation.

###### Medications Affecting Wound Healing

| Stage of Wound Healing (Duration) | Description | Examples of Medications Interfering with Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hemostasis (minutes) | Vasoconstriction, creation of platelet plug, coagulation and formation of fibrin mesh to hold clot together | Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, cytotoxic agents (decreased hematopoiesis) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| Inflammation (4–6 days) | Blood vessels leak plasma, and the resulting fluid engorgement facilitates transportation of white blood cells, antibodies, enzymes | NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, immunosuppressants, systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| Proliferation (4–24 days) | Fibrous tissue formation, collagen deposition, blood vessel formation, re-epithelialization | NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |
| Remodelling (21 days–2 y) | Reorganization of collagen fibres, wound contraction, increase in flexibility and tensile strength (to a maximum of 80% of preinjury strength) of wound | NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents |


###### Pain Management

Pressure injuries can be extremely painful, and pain management is critical to the success of therapy. Develop a patient-specific pain-management strategy based on a comprehensive pain assessment. Identifying the type of pain and its cause guides clinicians as to which type of intervention to use, while quantification of pain provides direction with regards to aggressiveness of treatment.



###### Psychosocial Management

Chronic disease, including wounds, may be associated with stress, anxiety and depression. In addition, these conditions may heighten a person’s experience of pain.​[^[30]] Patients experiencing emotional distress may benefit from interventions such as anxiety-reduction techniques, cognitive behavioural therapy and support groups.

Wounds and wound care may cause a disruption in a person’s everyday activities and decrease their ability to socialize. Minimize impact on quality of life by adjusting wound care schedules to accommodate important patient activities and using dressings that are less cumbersome and reduce odour where feasible.

###### Financial Considerations

Ascertain if there are any financial barriers to the patient adhering to treatment: consult a social worker where needed to help patients navigate these issues. Examples of expenses that may arise include both direct costs such as medications and dressings that are not covered by insurance and psychotherapy and indirect costs such as transportation to appointments.

#### Healability



Treatment plans, including local wound care, differ depending on healability. While the goal with healable wounds is to achieve complete healing of the injury, the goal of therapy with nonhealable and maintenance wounds is to reduce pain and prevent infection.​[^[31]]

#### Local Wound Care



It is important to monitor the wound by photography or measurements on a regular basis to assess improvement.

#### Wound Cleansing

Wound cleansing facilitates healing by using fluids to reduce the bacterial burden and to remove devitalized tissue and metabolic waste. Cleansing is recommended at initial assessment to improve visualization of the injury and prepare the wound bed for treatment, and at every dressing change.​[^[8]] Types of cleansing solutions and considerations for their use are presented in Table 3.

| Cleansing Solution | Description | Usage Considerations | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tap water | Drinkable (potable) tap water | No evidence that using tap water to cleanse wounds increases or decreases infection or healing.​[34]​[35]In the absence of potable tap water, boiled and cooled water or distilled water can be used.​[34] | Most wounds. Some sources recommend caution in immunocompromised patients.​[36] |
| Sterile normal saline | 0.9% sodium chloride in water (multi- or single-use containers) | Open saline should be discarded after 24 hours. | Safe for all types of wounds. |
| Commercial wound cleansers | Iso- or hypertonic solutions that may contain:Surfactants to facilitate autolysisPreservatives to extend shelf life | Cleanses and loosens debris from wound bed.Surfactants reduce surface tension between wound bed and debris, allowing removal with less force.“Spray” or “stream” applicator products allow for control of force used during application. | Wounds with adherent cellular debris. |
| Antimicrobial wound cleansers | Antimicrobial solutions effective against a variety of pathogens, e.g., acetic acid, chlorhexidine, octenidine hydrochloride (OCT), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), povidone-iodine, sodium hypochloriteStrength of the antimicrobial determines efficacy and potential toxicity of the product | Often combined with surfactants in commercial products (e.g., OCT, PHMB).Antimicrobial activity may be dependent on how long the wound bed is exposed to the product.Some products require the wound bed to be rinsed with water or saline after use to remove residue.Cytotoxicity of the solution must be considered: may negatively affect wound healing. | Wounds with high bacterial colonization or suspected or confirmed infection. |




#### Wound Débridement





See Table 4 for a description of the methods used for débridement of wounds.

| Method | Description | Clinical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sharp/surgical | Conservative sharp: Removal of nonviable tissue with sharp instruments such as sterile scissors, curette, forceps, scalpel. Viable tissue is not excised.Generally performed at the bedside. | Pain and bleeding not expected, as only nonviable tissue is being manipulated. |
| Surgical/sharp: Removal of nonviable and some viable tissue with sharp instruments.Generally performed at the bedside but removal of large amounts of tissue is recommended to be done in the operating room (OR).​[14] | Causes pain and bleeding due to excision of viable tissue.Pain management is critical. Topical or local anesthesia may be required for procedures not taking place in the OR.Bleeding can be managed by local pressure applied with gauze or by electrocautery. Alginate dressings can also help stop bleeding (see Wound Dressings section).Recommended when there is urgent need, such as with advancing cellulitis, crepitus, fluctuance and/or sepsis from wound-related infection.Considered in the presence of undermining, tunnelling or extensive necrosis.Not appropriate for nonhealable wounds. |  |
| Autolytic | Moist wounds naturally produce fluids containing white blood cells and enzymes during the inflammatory phase of healing, which liquefies necrotic tissue.Moisture-retentive dressings (see Wound Dressings section) are used to maintain the moist environment necessary to rehydrate and soften devitalized tissue, allowing it to be broken down naturally.Dry eschar (with the exception of that on heels or ischemic limbs) can be scored with a scalpel to facilitate softening and breakdown. | Painless.Increased exudate may occur: choose a dressing that can accommodate this (see Wound Dressings section).Wounds will require cleansing to remove devitalized materials as they accumulate.Not recommended for infected wounds; exceptions should be undertaken with caution.​[38] |
| Mechanical | Mechanical forces are used to remove bacteria and nonviable tissue. These may include:Wet-to-dry dressings: A wet gauze dressing is placed on the wound bed and allowed to dry. When removed, it takes off adherent debris.Low-frequency ultrasound: Disperses bacterial biofilms and stimulates wound healing.​[39]Wound irrigation: Wound is flushed with a cleansing solution (see Table 3) using a nontraumatic irrigation pressure of 4–15 psi, which may be obtained by using a 30 mL syringe with an 18-gauge angiocatheter, a 35 mL syringe with a 19-gauge angiocatheter or a single-use 100 mL squeeze bottle.​[8]​[40]Polyacrylic microfibre pads: When used in a circular motion, monofilament fibres reach into the wound bed and loosen debris and nonviable tissue. | Wet-to-dry dressings: This method is not recommended, as it causes pain and traumatizes healthy tissue.​[41]Wound irrigation: May be useful for softening eschar.​[4]Polyacrylic microfibre pads: generally painless. Not commonly used in practice; more selective methods are preferred.​[8] |
| Enzymatic | Proteolytic enzymes (e.g., collagenase) are applied to the wound to breakdown devitalized tissues by digesting collagen fibres that attach the necrotic tissue to the wound base.​[8] | Enzymatic agents are less effective in a dry environment; dry eschar must be scored and kept moist to maintain effectiveness.​[8] |
| Biologic | Irradiated maggots (larvae) help débride wounds by chemically degrading and ingesting necrotic tissue.​[41] They also secrete substances that destroy bacteria.​[42] |  |


#### Wound Dressings



As wounds heal, dressing needs may change; monitor the wound at every dressing change and reassess the appropriateness of the current dressing at least once per week.​[^[8]]



####### Primary Dressings

A primary dressing is one applied directly to the wound bed.

The purpose of a primary dressing is to maintain optimal moisture balance. Keeping the ulcer bed continuously moist but not macerated reduces pain and accelerates healing by promoting autolytic débridement (see Table 4).

Primary dressings are also used to maintain contact of an antimicrobial agent directly with the wound bed when infection is present or suspected (see Infected Wounds section).

####### Secondary Dressings

A secondary dressing is one applied on top of a primary dressing.

The purpose of a secondary dressing is to keep the primary dressing in place and cover the wound.





####### Dressing Types

| Classification | Description | Indications | Contraindications | Moisture Absorption​[49] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alginates | Sheets or fibrous ropes of glucuronic acid and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (seaweed derivative)Hemostatic capabilities | Moderate to high levels of exudateLocal hemostasisFacilitating autolytic débridementFilling of dead space in wound | Dry woundsNarrow or deep sinusesHeavy or uncontrolled bleeding | +++ |
| Foams | Adherent or nonadherent (with or without adhesive border) polyurethane foamProducts have varying moisture vapour transmission rates | Low to moderate levels of exudateFacilitating autolytic débridement | Highly exudating wounds (requiring dressing changes ≥once daily)Ischemic nonhealable wounds | ++ |
| Gauze | Bleached fabric made from fibres of cotton, rayon or polyesterWoven or nonwoven (the latter being more absorbent and less likely to shed lint) | Low to high levels of exudateFilling dead space in woundsDelivering pastes, ointments, gelsCleansing periwound tissue (the surrounding skin extending from a wound bed)Absorbing wound cleansersMechanical débridement (not recommended) |  | + |
| Hydrocolloids | Occlusive sheet dressings with polyurethane outer layerMay contain gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or pectinA characteristic unpleasant odour, created as the dressing absorbs exudate, is noticeable at dressing changes and may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection | Low levels of exudateFacilitating autolytic débridement | Moderate to high levels of exudateInfected woundsDeep cavitiesDry lower limb ulcers with arterial insufficiency​[50] | + |

#### Infected Wounds



If infection is suspected clinically, culture the wound. Because all pressure ulcers contain bacteria, qualitative wound cultures are not diagnostic of infection; quantitative cultures showing heavy growth are considered indicative of infection if occurring in combination with clinical signs and symptoms. A correctly performed wound swab is easier and less invasive than wound tissue biopsy and has been shown to provide comparable results.​[^[52]] The recommended swabbing method for obtaining a quantitative wound culture is the Levine technique, which involves applying a culture swab to a cleaned area of the wound with enough pressure to extrude fluid from the wound over 5 seconds.​[^[8]]​[^[52]] It can be painful for the patient.



A systematic review was not able to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of one topical antibiotic over another due to the quality of the evidence available.​[^[53]]

Antimicrobial dressings must come into direct contact with the wound bed to be effective. Use for at least 2 weeks before assessing effectiveness, and discontinue use once the wound no longer appears to be infected. Antimicrobials are available in many formats, including pastes and powders or impregnated in dressings such as alginates, foams, gauzes, gels, gelling fibres, hydrocolloids and nonadherent synthetic contact layers (see Table 5 and Table 6).

| Classification | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Gentian violet/methylene blue | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial action |
| Honey | Must be medical grade. Leptospernum species medical grade honey dressings are more effective than other types of honey dressings​[54] |
| Iodine (povidone and cadexomer) | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial actionContraindicated before/after use of radioactive iodine, in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, renal disordersUse with caution in thyroid disorders, deep ulcerative wounds |
| Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) | Broad-spectrum antimicrobial action |
| Silver | Available in both salt and metallic forms |


Consider starting broad-spectrum **systemic antibiotics** if a spreading or systemic infection is suspected, and adjust therapy based on culture and sensitivities. See Bacterial Skin Infections, Acute Osteomyelitis and Diabetic Foot Infections for more information.
