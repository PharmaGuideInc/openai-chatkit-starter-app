CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Anemia is a condition that reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to tissues. It is defined as having fewer than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal amount of hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood. Anemia is a significant global public health problem with an estimated 1.92 billion people affected.​[^[1]] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using Hb as a reliable objective indicator of diagnosing anemia, with thresholds set at an Hb level of <130 g/L in men and <120 g/L in nonpregnant women.​[^[2]] A reduction in hematocrit (Hct) or RBC count can also be used to define anemia. It is notable that these Hb ranges may not be applicable for all patients. Examples include people living at high altitudes, who have values higher than those living at sea level,​[^[3]] and people who smoke, who have higher Hct values than those who do not.​[^[4]] African-American patients may have Hb values 5–10 g/L lower than comparable Caucasian populations;​[^[5]] however, considering the high prevalence of anemia in African-American patients is primarily due to differences in social determinants of health,​[^[6]] the difference in Hb thresholds should be interpreted with caution.

In this review, anemias responsive to pharmacologic therapy are discussed. These include anemias in the adult population due to iron, vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, or anemias responding to erythropoietin therapy. As well, anemia of chronic disease is briefly discussed in the context of differential diagnosis from iron deficiency anemia.

#### Iron Deficiency Anemia

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional disorder, accounts for nearly half of all anemia cases, and is most prevalent among preschool children and women. Iron deficiency anemia is present in 1–2% of adults; iron deficiency without anemia occurs in up to 11% of women and 4% of men.​[^[16]] The most common cause of iron deficiency is blood loss, which can be overt or occult.​[^[17]] Blood loss through the GI tract is the most common cause of occult blood loss in men and in postmenopausal patients. Regular blood donors, patients with chronic hemolysis and patients who are menstruating may develop iron deficiency. Decreased iron absorption in patients due to disorders such as celiac disease or autoimmune atrophic gastritis or in those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery can also result in iron deficiency and IDA.

IDA typically presents as a microcytic anemia with a low MCV. A serum ferritin level is used in the diagnosis of IDA, and decreased levels are diagnostic. Other measurements (transferrin saturation) can also be used. Iron metabolism is regulated by hepcidin, a hormone that is primarily produced in the liver.​[^[18]] High levels of hepcidin promote the storage of iron in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and reduces iron absorption from the gut. The production of hepcidin is suppressed in response to hypoxia, iron deficiency and in the presence of erythropoietin. An increased level of hepcidin correlates with an elevated serum ferritin, which indicates iron stores are high. A patient with IDA will present with low ferritin, microcytic RBC, low Hb, and theoretically low hepcidin levels.​[^[19]] Measurement of hepcidin levels is currently not widely available outside of research settings.

#### Anemia of Chronic Disease

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is the second-most-prevalent cause of anemia after iron deficiency anemia.​[^[11]] During periods of inflammation or infection, hepcidin levels are elevated, as its production is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.​[^[20]] Hepcidin has been identified as an antimicrobial and acts to sequester iron from invading bacteria by removing iron from the circulation.​[^[18]] An elevated ferritin level with evidence of inflammation (e.g., increased serum C-reactive protein levels) in a patient with a normocytic/microcytic anemia may be indicative of ACD. Serum transferrin and transferrin saturation are laboratory measurements used to assess iron disorders (see Table 1). 

The diagnosis and treatment of ACD can be a challenge, as there may be overlap of an iron deficiency state with ACD. As ACD is caused by an underlying disorder, it may not be feasible to completely eradicate the condition. If possible, addressing and controlling the inflammatory disorder is the recommended strategy to resolve ACD.

| Clinical Parameter | Iron Deficiency Anemia | Anemia of Chronic Disease | Iron Deficiency Anemia and Anemia of Chronic Disease |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-Reactive Protein​[a] | Normal | High | High |
| Hemoglobin | Low | Low | Low |
| Ferritin​[a] | Low | Normal-high | Normal-high |
| Transferrin Saturation | Low | Low-normal | Low-normal |
| Transferrin | High | Low-normal | Low |
| Mean Corpuscular Volume | Low | Low-normal | Low |


#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Dietary iron, especially from foods rich in heme iron (liver; lean red meats; seafood such as oysters, clams, tuna, salmon, sardines and shrimp), can contribute to the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, but typically requires more time to replete iron stores compared to pharmacologic replacement therapy.​[^[21]] Furthermore, it may not be sufficient in the face of more severe deficiency or in cases where iron losses exceed dietary intake. Plant-based diets contain nonheme iron, which has low bioavailability. Sources of nonheme iron include beans, lentils, tofu, spinach and fortified cereals.

The role of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in the absorption of nonheme iron is controversial and a randomized controlled study and subsequent systematic review and meta-analyses have not shown any benefit from vitamin C supplementation in patients with iron deficiency anemia receiving oral iron supplementation.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]] It is unclear whether these findings can be extrapolated to nonheme iron obtained from dietary sources. It may be reasonable to recommend the combination of vitamin C–rich foods with plant-based sources of iron, especially in individuals who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet.​[^[25]]

Polyphenols and phytates found in tea and coffee can inhibit nonheme iron absorption.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Additional information on drug therapy for iron deficiency anemia can be found in Table 2.



A reticulocyte response should be evident within 1 week of beginning iron therapy, with subsequent improvement in the Hb of about 10 g/L every 7–10 days.

There is no specific duration for iron supplementation. If an underlying cause of anemia is identified and treated, iron supplementation can be continued until iron stores are replenished. Some clinicians recommend continuing treatment for 3 months after the target Hb has been reached. If an underlying cause cannot be identified or cannot be definitively treated, it may be reasonable to educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of anemia and to routinely screen for recurrence of anemia through blood testing.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

It is recommended that pregnant patients meet the dietary requirements of iron through diet and/or supplements to prevent the development of iron deficiency during pregnancy and postpartum. During pregnancy, iron requirements increase due to expansion of maternal red cell mass and growth of the fetus and placenta.

Treatment of iron deficiency in pregnant patients is the same as in nonpregnant patients. There are no reported teratogenic effects of iron supplementation on the fetus. Iron normally passes into breast milk where it is an important source of dietary iron for the developing infant. The amount of iron in breast milk is generally not influenced significantly by maternal iron status.

In a trial of pregnant patients, 20 mg/day of elemental iron started at 20 weeksʼ gestation was well tolerated and resulted in fewer cases of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.​[^[35]] Iron supplementation may be associated with lower rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.​[^[36]]​[^[37]]



A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Megaloblastic Anemias

Megaloblastic anemias arise because of impaired DNA synthesis of the RBC caused by deficiencies of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or folate (folic acid), or due to impaired DNA and RNA metabolism (drugs, myelodysplasia). Megaloblastic anemias are a subset of macrocytic anemias (anemia associated with increased red cell size) and are characterized by hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood film.

Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency may present with anemia/macrocytic RBCs or pancytopenia and may have neurologic complications including dementia, weakness, sensory neuropathy and paresthesias (subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord). Folic acid supplementation may partially alleviate and mask the hematologic effects of cobalamin deficiency, but does not treat the neurologic complications. Patients with low-normal or even normal serum vitamin B12 values may be deficient and respond to vitamin B12 replacement.​[^[40]]

The clinical manifestations of megaloblastosis may be subtle in older adults and may precede the development of anemia. A high index of suspicion is warranted.​[^[41]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Restoring normal dietary intake of vitamin B12 and folate may be sufficient to completely reverse megaloblastosis. However, patients with neurologic deficits due to vitamin B12 deficiency should be treated pharmacologically to maximize the likelihood of full neurologic recovery. Vitamin B12 is present in foods of animal origin; examples include meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy products. Folate is present in a variety of foods including vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables), fruit, nuts and beans, and is also present in foods containing vitamin B12: meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy products.

Abstinence from alcohol may be necessary.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Additional information on drug therapy for megaloblastic anemia can be found in Table 2.

#### Vitamin B12



#### Folic Acid



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

It is recommended that pregnant patients meet the dietary requirements of vitamin B12 and supplement with folic acid during pregnancy. With the exception of strict vegans, some vegetarians and patients with malabsorption (pernicious anemia), vitamin B12 is maintained at sufficient levels during pregnancy and does not typically require supplementation. Due to the recognized association between folate deficiency and fetal neural tube defects, folic acid supplementation is universally recommended before and during pregnancy. There are no teratogenic effects of either vitamin B12 or folic acid during pregnancy. Most authorities recommend that pregnant patients take a multivitamin containing folic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Multivitamins recommended during pregnancy typically contain higher doses of folic acid than regular multivitamins. Both vitamin B12 and folate pass into breast milk but are compatible with breastfeeding.



A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Anemias Responsive to Pharmacologic Stimulation of Erythropoiesis

Most patients with nutritional anemias (iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), hemolysis or bleeding have elevated levels of endogenous erythropoietin; however, there are a number of situations in which pharmacologic stimulation of red cell production using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is beneficial, including the management of:



#### Investigations

 In most patients, Hb should be <100 g/L in order to qualify for ESA therapy. As well, selection of patients for ESA therapy is determined in part by baseline endogenous erythropoietin levels (approximately 3–30 units/L in healthy individuals). ESA therapy is generally titrated to ensure Hb levels do not exceed a certain threshold, depending on the indication.

It is important to ensure an adequate iron supply in conjunction with erythropoietin use.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Additional information on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can be found in Table 3.

The choice of agent and dosage regimen varies according to the clinical situation. Both available agents in Canada may be given by IV or SC injection. Epoetin alfa is a recombinant human erythropoietin with a relatively short half-life that is typically given at least 3 times per week. It may also be administered daily in the preoperative surgical setting where a more rapid rise is desired. Darbepoetin alfa is a synthetic erythropoietin analogue with a longer half-life that is typically given weekly or biweekly, and monthly in some patients.

Although ESAs have improved the quality of life in patients with anemia due to chronic renal failure,​[^[55]] they did not improve quality of life or fatigue in patients with anemia due to AIDS or cancer.​[^[56]]​[^[57]] Additionally, the use of ESAs increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events when dosed to achieve a normal Hb.​[^[58]] Clinicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of ESAs before initiating their use. If ESAs are initiated, target Hb should be <100–120 g/L, depending on the indication, and Hb should be monitored at least monthly.​[^[59]] 

ESAs have been associated with the development of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), a potentially devastating complication in which neutralizing antibodies to the exogenous protein cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin, resulting in profound anemia. Changes in the formulation and handling of these proteins have greatly reduced the risk of PRCA.​[^[60]] Nevertheless, the possibility of PRCA should be considered if the patient’s anemia becomes refractory to therapy.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using ESAs in pregnant patients. Use of ESAs in pregnancy does not seem to present a major risk to the fetus.​[^[61]] Worsening of hypertension or thrombosis are serious potential risks. However, anemia and frequent blood transfusions also present risks to the fetus. In these situations, ESAs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Adequate iron supplementation is particularly important in this setting if ESAs are used.

ESAs have been used in infants with no serious adverse effects.​[^[61]] It is not known whether ESAs pass into breast milk; exercise caution in breastfeeding patients.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for evaluating anemia based on CBC (Complete Blood Count) and peripheral blood smear results. It categorizes anemia into three types based on Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Microcytic, Normocytic, and Macrocytic Anemia. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Microcytic Anemia (MCV < 80)
1. **Serum Iron Studies**: Check iron, ferritin, and Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC).
   - **Low iron, low ferritin, high TIBC**: 
     - Diagnosis: Iron deficiency anemia.
   - **Low/normal iron, low/normal ferritin, low TIBC**:
     - Consider anemia of chronic disease with iron deficiency anemia.
     - **Mentzer index < 13?**
       - Yes: Consider thalassemia; perform Hb electrophoresis.

### Normocytic Anemia (MCV 80–100)
1. **Reticulocyte Count**:
   - **Hyperproliferative (>2%)?**
     - Yes: Indicates hemolysis or hemorrhage.
   - **Other cytopenias? Abnormal leukocytes?**
     - No: Consider anemia of chronic disease, renal failure, pure red cell aplasia.
     - Yes: Bone marrow evaluation for aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or other bone marrow failure syndromes.

### Macrocytic Anemia (MCV > 100)
1. **Megaloblastic Anemia?** (Presence of megalocytes and segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear)
   - Yes: Check for Vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency; rule out drug-induced deficiency.
   - No: Consider Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), liver disease, alcohol abuse.

### Notes
- The flowchart provides a systematic approach to diagnosing different types of anemia based on laboratory findings and clinical considerations.
- It includes specific tests and conditions to consider for each type of anemia, guiding further diagnostic evaluation and management.
