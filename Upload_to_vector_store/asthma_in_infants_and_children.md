#### Introduction

According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), asthma is a heterogeneous disease of the airways characterized by chronic airway inflammation and reversible airway obstruction. Typically there is airway hyperresponsiveness to a certain stimuli.​[^[1]] Patients may experience recurrent episodes of cough, wheezing, dyspnea and chest tightness as well as airflow obstruction; these episodes may vary in duration and intensity.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]

This chapter focuses on the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of asthma in infants and children <18 years of age. While the new GINA guidelines have encouraged similar pharmacologic management of adults and children >12 years, there remain important differences in the day-to-day management of young children and adolescents that should be highlighted. These nuances in care are discussed in this chapter. For information regarding asthma in adults, see Asthma in Adults.

See Figure 1 for an asthma management algorithm and Table 2 for detailed drug information.

#### Principles of Management

Asthma symptoms are due to airway hyperreactivity and narrowing. Airway obstruction is due to a combination of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. SABAs provide short-term relief from bronchospasm and have no effect on airway inflammation. Furthermore, regular use of SABAs has been associated with decreased effect (tachyphylaxis) and rebound bronchoconstriction.​[^[18]] As such, the GINA report has removed SABAs as the first step in asthma management for children >6 years of age and adults, and encourages the earlier use of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). While this was not formally added to the guidelines for younger children (<6 y) at the time of publication, the Canadian guidelines also encourage the earlier use of an ICS in children <6 years of age.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] 

Regular use of an ICS to treat airway inflammation is required if the symptoms or measurements of airway dysfunction are perceived as persistent.​[^[19]] Inhaled corticosteroids control airway obstruction within weeks of initiation. Regular use for months or years is required to control airway inflammation.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] The episodic use of ICS for a few weeks at a time may be sufficient to control symptoms in some milder cases, but has not been shown to be adequate for cases of more persistent asthma.​[^[22]]

#### Drug Delivery Devices

Inhalation is the preferred route of administration because the therapeutic effect is maximized and systemic side effects are minimized. The hydrofluoroalkane propellants (HFA) used in pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) demonstrate excellent lung deposition of active ingredients.​[^[23]]

Review inhalation technique regularly (see Therapeutic Tips). For infants and young children (<5 y), a pMDI and spacer device (also called a holding chamber) with a mask or mouthpiece attachment improves ability to correctly use the device. Assess very young infants for their ability to produce sufficient respiratory effort to open and close the valves of a spacer device with mask. Drug deposition with a pMDI and spacer in infants and young children is generally 10–20% of the deposition in adults.​[^[24]] Therefore, higher doses may be required in younger children using a mask.​[^[25]] In older children (≥5 y), either a dry powder device or a pMDI with a mouthpiece and spacer device may be used. Adherence may be enhanced if children participate in the selection of the device that works best for them. Incentive spirometers provide visual feedback to children about their inspiratory flows and can be an added teaching device.

Wet nebulization is a less attractive alternative due to difficulties with portability, time required for therapy, aerosolization of virus (e.g., COVID-19) and cost.​[^[1]]​[^[26]] Furthermore, lung deposition of a drug is compromised if the technique is not meticulous, such as when the mask is not on the child’s face, if tubing is used rather than the mask or if a soother is in the infant’s mouth. Treatment of asthma exacerbations with pMDI salbutamol is just as effective as that from nebulization.​[^[27]]

#### Bronchodilator Agents

#### Short-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

SABAs such as salbutamol and terbutaline effectively relieve smooth muscle spasm, but do not reduce airway reactivity or inflammation. Administration of a SABA (e.g., 2 inhalations of 100 mcg/inhalation salbutamol) 5–10 minutes before exercise prevents exercise-induced bronchospasm for up to 2–4 hours.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]

 Use on an as-needed basis provides both rapid relief and valuable information on underlying asthma control. Use of SABAs >2 times per week (including any doses used to prevent or treat exercise-induced symptoms) indicates suboptimal long-term control.​[^[3]]​[^[30]] Urgently assess children who do not derive adequate relief from SABAs or those requiring SABAs for relief of shortness of breath at night; a course of systemic corticosteroids may be required, and the initiation of daily ICS is recommended.​[^[1]]

 SABAs are very effective at providing relief from wheeze or shortness of breath; consider alternate diagnoses in all children who do not benefit from the use of these agents.

#### Long-Acting Inhaled Beta2-agonists

Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) such as salmeterol and formoterol provide up to 12 hours of symptom control and protection from exercise-induced bronchospasm.​[^[31]] The exact role of LABAs in children is evolving; however, they should always be used in combination with an ICS.​[^[13]]​[^[32]] In steroid-naïve individuals with asthma, initiating therapy with ICS is as effective as initiating therapy with a combination of ICS/LABA.​[^[33]] However, in the setting of suboptimal asthma control, ICS/LABA combination therapy has been helpful in children 6–11 years of age on moderate doses of ICS and children >12 years of age on low doses of ICS.​[^[1]]​[^[13]] There is a suggestion of improvement in lung function measurements and improved linear growth with ICS/LABA compared with doubling the dose of ICS. However, studies in children have not demonstrated a reduction in asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids when comparing ICS versus ICS/LABA.​[^[34]] In children <6 years of age with asthma, the role of LABAs remains to be determined. Recent guideline updates recommend referral to a specialist before any consideration of LABA add-on therapy​[^[2]].

The budesonide/​formoterol combination, used as both maintenance and rescue therapy, was superior to either a fixed dose of budesonide/formoterol plus terbutaline rescue therapy or a high dose of budesonide plus terbutaline rescue therapy in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations, in the use of as-needed medication, and in symptoms such as nocturnal awakening.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Currently, this combination is indicated for patients ≥12 years of age. At the time of publication, there have not yet been studies evaluating as-needed ICS/formoterol in children <12 years of age.​[^[1]]

While the combination of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs can contribute to improved asthma control, it is important to remember there are a number of reasons for inadequate control of asthma (see Difficult-to-Control Asthma). Combination products should be used only after review and reinforcement of asthma control recommendations: 1) avoidance of triggers, 2) regular use of ICS and 3) good inhalation technique.

#### Oral Beta2-agonists

Oral beta2-agonists for asthma management in children have been supplanted by the inhalation form, due to improved efficacy and reduction in systemic side effects.

#### Anticholinergic Agents

This class of medication has seen an increased use in adults due to improved selectivity of these agents. Ipratropium **bromide** remains an adjunctive therapy in severe acute asthma exacerbations in children.​[^[37]] Other newer anticholinergic medications (e.g., tiotropium) are now being studied in all ages groups; while it appears their safety is reasonable, the efficacy remains to be determined.​[^[38]]​[^[39]]

Although not approved for use in children in Canada, the international GINA report recommends the use of tiotropium (mist inhaler) as add-on therapy in children >6 years of age with a history of exacerbations despite appropriate, medium-dose ICS/LABA therapy.​[^[1]] Referral to a pediatric asthma specialist is recommended if add-on tiotropium is being considered.

#### Methylxanthines

Theophylline preparations used as add-on therapy historically had an additional anti-inflammatory role in patients already using ICS therapy.​[^[40]]​[^[41]] Theophylline is rarely used for asthma therapy in children because of the potential for toxicity, numerous drug interactions and the need for monitoring of serum levels. There is no evidence that IV aminophylline is superior in an ICU setting compared to continuous beta2-agonist IV.​[^[42]] Oxtriphylline is no longer available as a single-ingredient product in Canada.

#### Anti-inflammatory Agents

#### Inhaled Corticosteroids

Inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone and mometasone) are the cornerstone of asthma management in infants and children, both to reduce and control symptoms and to prevent airway remodelling.​[^[12]] Regular use of ICS has been found to have the following effects:



Inhaled corticosteroids do not cure asthma and do not prevent development of asthma in preschool children at high risk. Cessation following months of regular use may result in return of airway hyperreactivity to the previous state.​[^[43]]

Symptom control generally occurs within days with low doses (see Table 1);​[^[45]] however, reduction in airway hyperreactivity may require months of regular use.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] The majority of children with asthma experience good control with low doses of ICS.​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]]​[^[49]]​[^[50]] Reconsider the diagnosis in children whose asthma is poorly controlled at higher doses, e.g., >800 mcg/day of budesonide or equivalent.

Doubling (up to quintupling) the dose of ICS in response to a viral respiratory tract infection or to control an exacerbation of asthma is a common practice. However, the early signs of an exacerbation are poorly defined and often underappreciated.​[^[51]] Moreover, the dose response relationship of inhaled corticosteroids has not been consistent.​[^[52]] As such, the episodic increasing of ICS dose with exacerbations is not supported by evidence nor by Canadian guidelines.​[^[13]]​[^[19]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]]​[^[55]]​[^[56]] Emphasize regular use of ICS in a dose sufficient to control airway hyperreactivity rather than episodic short-term doubling of ICS in response to asthma symptoms.​[^[57]]

Doses of budesonide ≤400 mcg/day or equivalent (see Table 1) have minimal systemic side effects. Most studies indicate there is an initial decrease in growth rate during the first year of ICS use, but that it has a minimal effect on final adult height (1–2.5 cm).​[^[58]]​[^[59]]​[^[60]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]]​[^[63]] There is a lack of data regarding higher doses of ICS or the impact of ICS “holidays,” e.g., discontinuation during the summer months. Always titrate to the lowest effective dose that maintains asthma control.

#### Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) (e.g., montelukast) may provide bronchoprotection with exercise and in patients with ASA-sensitive asthma;​[^[12]]​[^[20]] however, these patients should still avoid the use of NSAIDs when on LTRAs. Past reports suggested that montelukast may have corticosteroid-sparing properties,​[^[64]]​[^[65]]​[^[66]] resulting in improved asthma control and reduced exacerbations in preschool children,​[^[67]]​[^[68]] and might reduce asthma exacerbations in September in school-aged children and adolescents.​[^[69]] A 2015 Cochrane review has questioned the strength of these data.​[^[70]] LTRAs are not recommended as first-choice monotherapy in place of ICS, due to inferior efficacy in preventing acute exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids and in improving other parameters of lung function.​[^[71]]

LTRAs can be used as adjunctive therapy with moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids to achieve control of persistent asthma or in patients who cannot or will not use inhaled corticosteroids. It appears that the addition of LTRA is inferior to the addition of LABA for achieving asthma control.​[^[72]]

Due to reports of behavioural and mood-related changes, a boxed warning has been issued for montelukast; if such changes are observed in patients taking montelukast, the drug should be stopped and symptoms should be discussed immediately with a health-care professional.​[^[73]]

Reports of development of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome), an eosinophilic vasculitis, with the use of LTRAs likely represents an unmasking of the vasculitis as doses of systemic corticosteroids are reduced.​[^[74]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]]

Zafirlukast is no longer available in Canada.

#### Biologic Therapies

Targeted biologic therapies are being used in some children. Their use is still largely reserved for children diagnosed with asthma by a subspecialist where the asthma is not controlled by the therapies discussed above. Even for those patients who meet the criteria for therapy, most experts agree that more studies are needed to better indicate the benefit, especially in those <12 years of age.​[^[77]] Unfortunately, in many cases, high cost is also an important factor when considering biologics. The following therapies should be initiated and monitored by a specialist.



#### Difficult-to-Control Asthma

The majority of children with asthma can be well controlled with regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and SABAs for occasional relief.​[^[30]]​[^[80]] If there is ongoing difficulty with asthma control, as evidenced by persistent symptoms, a need for systemic corticosteroids or exacerbations of asthma necessitating an emergency department visit, consider several factors before concluding the child has difficult-to-control asthma:



Note: The use of systemic corticosteroids may have long-term consequences on adrenal function and on bone health. The use of 4 short courses of systemic corticosteroids over a period of 2.5 years has been associated with an increased risk of fractures.​[^[87]]

#### Asthma Exacerbation Management

An exacerbation of asthma requiring an unscheduled doctor’s visit, emergency room visit or hospitalization is a failure of long-term preventative management. Immediate care for respiratory distress, evaluation of the cause of the exacerbation and intensification of long-term preventative care are indicated.

An asthma exacerbation is a pediatric emergency. Initial therapy should be aggressive and then reduced as the exacerbation settles. Initial steps should include assessment of airway with continuous monitoring until the patient is stable. Intubation should be avoided, if possible. Noninvasive ventilation is preferred under close supervision. Oxygen should be administered if the patient is found to be hypoxic. Measure blood gases to guide therapy as necessary. See Figure 2 for an approach to asthma exacerbation management. Severe exacerbations are more likely in patients with oxygen saturation <95%, presence of suprasternal retraction, presence of scalene muscle contraction, reduced air entry, wheezing (inspiratory/stridor, expiratory or audible without stethoscope) or silent chest; for more information, see the PRAM scoring table.​[^[88]]

The cornerstones of therapy are supplemental oxygen, frequent high-dose inhaled SABA and systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone).​[^[89]] High-flow oxygen therapy has become an important means to stabilize children while the obstruction resolves.​[^[90]] Close observation and frequent reassessment of all children with acute severe asthma is mandatory. Be prepared for intubation, but avoid this and sedation, if possible. Noninvasive ventilation strategies are preferred. Correct mild to moderate dehydration if present. Always anticipate the possible need for airway control and subsequent difficult ventilatory management; controlled, rather than emergent, airway procedures are preferred. IV magnesium sulfate​[^[94]] or salbutamol are adjunctive therapies for more severe attacks. Ipratropium may provide some additional bronchodilation, but data supporting this are limited.​[^[91]]​[^[92]]​[^[93]]​[^[95]]​[^[96]] There is little evidence that aminophylline is required in the management of acute severe asthma.​[^[97]]​[^[98]] 

Asthma education, including an asthma action plan, should be performed in the urgent care setting before discharge, and patients should be prescribed an ICS in addition to a SABA. ​[^[2]]Arrange follow-up care for all children discharged home from the emergency department.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for managing asthma exacerbations in children. It outlines the steps for assessing and treating exacerbations, including medication dosages and follow-up actions.

### Initial Assessment
- **Assess severity of exacerbation**: Refer to Asthma Exacerbation Management.
- **Reassess frequently**.
- **Supplemental O₂**: Maintain SaO₂ >94%; consider nasal high flow.
- **Salbutamol pMDI**: 6–10 puffs every 20 minutes, 3 times.
- **Nebulized salbutamol every 20 minutes, 3 times**:
  - Weight ≤10 kg: 1.25–2.5 mg/dose
  - 11–20 kg: 2.5 mg/dose
  - >20 kg: 5 mg/dose

### Decision Points
1. **Improved**:
   - Continue management at home with:
     - 2–4 puffs SABA via pMDI every 4 hours for relief
     - Systemic corticosteroid PO (refer to side panel)
   - **Written instructions**:
     - Return if:
       - No response to SABA
       - Duration of response to SABA <4 hours
     - **Follow-up** with physician in 48–72 hours to evaluate:
       - Improvement
       - Duration of systemic corticosteroid
       - Need for ICS to prevent future urgent care visits

2. **Not Improved**:
   - Continue SABA every 20 minutes
   - Add:
     - Ipratropium bromide: 250 mg nebulized every hour or pMDI 5 puffs every hour
     - Systemic corticosteroids (refer to side panel)
   - **Vascular access**: Essential with moderate/severe respiratory distress, in case IV meds needed
   - Re-evaluate within 60 minutes
   - Consider pediatric ICU consultation

### Further Actions
- **Improved**:
  - Reduce SABA to every 1–2 hours
  - Continue with systemic corticosteroids
  - Consider sending home if relief from SABA lasts >2 hours

- **Not Improved**:
  - Continue above
  - Consider IV MgSO₄ 75 mg/kg over 20 minutes
  - Consider IV salbutamol
  - Monitor blood gases
  - Admit to ICU

### Systemic Corticosteroid Regimens
- **Oral Regimens**:
  1. Dexamethasone: 0.3–0.6 mg/kg/day PO (maximum 15 mg/day)
  2. Prednisone: 1–2 mg/kg daily PO as a single dose or divided BID (maximum 60 mg/day)

- **Intravenous Regimens**:
  1. Methylprednisolone: 2 mg/kg IV bolus (maximum 125 mg) then 0.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours
  2. Hydrocortisone: 5–8 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (maximum 500 mg)
