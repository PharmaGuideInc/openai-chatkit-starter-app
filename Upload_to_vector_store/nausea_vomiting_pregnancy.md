#### Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) occurs in 50–80% of pregnancies.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Despite the common term “morning sickness,” nausea and vomiting may occur at any time of day and may be constant throughout the day. Virtually all women who develop NVP have some symptoms by 9 weeks’ gestation, and more than half have symptoms by 6 weeks.​[^[3]] For the vast majority of women, the symptoms subside by 16 weeks; however, approximately 10% of women have NVP that persists beyond 20 weeks’ gestation.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a serious condition occurring in up to 2% of pregnant women.​[^[3]] It is characterized by intractable vomiting, beginning in the first trimester and possibly continuing throughout the pregnancy. The vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, nutritional deficiency and weight loss. This condition can threaten the survival of the fetus and the mother and requires early identification and treatment; hospitalization and IV therapy may be required. Such symptoms must also prompt investigation for specific diseases such as multiple-gestation pregnancy, molar pregnancy, urinary tract infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, thyrotoxicosis and hepatitis.​[^[3]] Hyperemesis gravidarum is typically diagnosed when other possible causes of nausea and vomiting have been ruled out.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Assess and treat NVP in all pregnancies to avoid significant medical and psychosocial morbidity resulting in disruption of work, home life, relationships, nutritional status and well-being. Consider other causes of nausea and vomiting not due to pregnancy as in the nonpregnant patient. A full assessment is especially appropriate for pregnant women who first experience nausea and vomiting after the first trimester or have additional symptoms such as pain or fever, which do not normally accompany NVP.



Alternatively, the modified pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) scoring index incorporates quality of life measurements into the severity grading by considering the patient’s perception of symptoms (see Table 1).​[^[5]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

There is insufficient evidence to recommend one pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention over another for the management of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.​[^[6]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Reassure patients that most mild to moderate forms of nausea and vomiting are normal, not harmful to the fetus and usually subside as the pregnancy progresses.

In patients with frequent vomiting, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte status orally or intravenously is essential.



Prenatal vitamins may worsen nausea, primarily due to the iron content as well as the large size of tablets. In the first trimester, women can take folic acid alone and choose a multivitamin that is low in iron.​[^[1]]

Lifestyle modifications that may alleviate NVP include avoiding feeling too warm, increasing rest, reducing work hours and reducing stress.​[^[1]]

Acupuncture and P6 acupressure have been the subject of numerous trials for NVP. P6 is also known as Nei Guan (“inner guard”) and is the sixth point along the pericardium meridian. P6 is anatomically located about 5 cm proximal to the distal crease of the wrist, between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis of either forearm (see Figure 1). The point can be stimulated with the tip of a finger, with or without moderate-pressure massaging. There is no consensus regarding how long or how often to apply the pressure, but some practitioners recommend 5 minutes of pressure every 4 hours. Patients may be taught to do this themselves or they can apply pressure by wearing an acupressure wristband, an elasticized band with a protruding button that is placed over the acupressure point. Some studies (in motion sickness) have shown less efficacy with wristbands than with manual pressure because the wristbands tend to slip out of position. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture or acupressure at P6 have shown equivocal results.​[^[6]] While acupressure has not been clearly shown to be better than dietary or lifestyle advice or “dummy” acupressure, the manual application of acupressure is harmless and without cost.​[^[8]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a detailed anatomical illustration of the forearm and hand, focusing on specific tendons and an acupressure point. Here is a breakdown of the labeled components:

1. **Palmaris Longus Tendon**: This tendon is shown running along the forearm. It is a slender tendon that is often used as a landmark in the wrist.

2. **P6 Acupressure Point**: This point is marked on the forearm. It is commonly used in acupressure and acupuncture, known for its potential to relieve nausea and anxiety.

3. **Flexor Carpi Radialis Tendon**: This tendon is also depicted in the forearm. It is one of the key tendons involved in flexing the wrist.

4. **Distal Crease**: This is the crease on the wrist, marking the boundary between the forearm and the hand.

5. **Palm**: The palm of the hand is indicated, showing the transition from the wrist to the hand.

The illustration provides a clear view of the anatomical structures and their relationships, useful for understanding the location of the P6 acupressure point in relation to the tendons.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

An algorithm for the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is presented in Figure 2.

The best available evidence suggests that ginger​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]] and pyridoxine are likely beneficial for mild NVP.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] A product containing pyridoxine in combination with an antihistamine (doxylamine-pyridoxine) is the only medication specifically approved for the treatment of NVP in Canada; however, its use is controversial. A re-evaluation of the efficacy evidence​[^[14]] to include previously unpublished data​[^[15]] was performed in 2018 and found no benefit of doxylamine-pyridoxine versus placebo for the treatment of NVP.​[^[16]] The authors concluded that clinical practice and guidelines should be updated to reflect the evidence; however, the combination product remains first-line therapy for many.​[^[1]] Given the lack of clinical efficacy of the combination, a trial of single-entity pyridoxine is a reasonable evidence-based approach to NVP prior to considering the combination.

Expert opinion suggests that first-line options for moderate to severe NVP include dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine and promethazine; second-line agents include chlorpromazine, methylprednisolone, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine.​[^[1]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Reserve corticosteroids for the treatment of resistant cases of NVP after the first trimester. Limit metoclopramide therapy to 5 days since it may cause oculogyric crisis.​[^[17]] 

While ondansetron does not appear to be associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes,​[^[20]]​[^[21]] safety concerns may limit its use in NVP to refractory cases and hyperemesis gravidarum. A 2018 retrospective cohort study of 1.8 million pregnancies found a small increased risk of oral clefts in infants exposed to ondansetron in the first trimester, but no association to cardiac malformations or congenital malformations overall after accounting for confounding variables.​[^[22]] Based upon this data, Health Canada released safety labelling updates in 2020 recommending against use of ondansetron in pregnancy;​[^[23]] however, the challenges of adequately managing patients with NVP and hyperemesis gravidarum are such that ondansetron will likely still be used clinically in treatment of these patients. The risk of oral clefts and the conflicting evidence regarding the potential for cardiac malformations must be carefully explained to pregnant women considering ondansetron therapy.

The literature shows that rates of marijuana use in pregnancy are increasing,​[^[24]] and the legalization of cannabis/marijuana in Canada in October of 2018 creates the potential for more women to consider the use of this substance in treating NVP. It is important to discuss cannabis use with patients presenting with NVP, as reports suggest prenatal cannabis use may actually contribute to NVP​[^[24]] and chronic use can result in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.​[^[25]]​[^[26]] In addition to the effect on NVP, cannabinoids cross the placenta and impact the developing fetus. In utero exposure to cannabis has been linked to withdrawal-like syndrome in newborns (e.g., increase in startles and tremors) and has been associated with long-term effects on neurologic development in children that present at preschool age (e.g., lower scores on language, memory and abstract/visual reasoning), which persists into young adulthood (e.g., impaired working memory, inattention, impulsivity and inability to plan). While the evidence is limited, cannabis use has also been associated with low birth weights, stillbirth, spontaneous preterm birth and admission to neonatal intensive care. Health Canada advises that cannabis is not recommended in women of childbearing age who are not on a reliable contraceptive or who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning a pregnancy.​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

#### Choices during Breastfeeding

The agents used in pregnancy are also considered safe for use while breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in this population can be found in Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in this appendix.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for managing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), including hyperemesis gravidarum. It outlines the assessment and treatment steps based on severity.

### Initial Assessment
- **When pregnancy is confirmed**, assess the presence and severity of nausea and vomiting.

### Mild NVP
- **Nonpharmacologic therapies:**
  - Eat small, frequent meals
  - Eat bland foods
  - Avoid spicy, fatty, or strong-smelling foods
  - Take frequent naps/rests
  - Shorten workday, if possible
  - Practice P6 acupressure
- **Pharmacologic therapies:**
  - Ginger tablet 250 mg Q6H PO
  - Pyridoxine 25 mg Q8H PO

### Moderate-to-Severe NVP or Hyperemesis Gravidarum
- Start/continue any or all interventions for mild NVP and add a first-line agent:
  - Dimenhydrinate 50 mg Q4–6H PRN PO/PR/IV
  - Diphenhydramine 25 mg Q4–6H or 50 mg Q6–8H PRN PO
  - Promethazine 12.5–25 mg Q4–6H PRN PO

### Persistent NVP
- **Without dehydration:**
  - Start/continue any or all interventions for mild NVP and add a second-line agent:
    - Chlorpromazine 10–25 mg Q4–6H PRN PO
    - Metoclopramide 5–10 mg Q8H PO/IV
    - Prochlorperazine 5–10 mg Q6–8H PRN PO/PR
- **With dehydration:**
  - Administer IV fluids + Ondansetron 4 mg Q8H or 8 mg Q12H PRN PO/IV

### Persistent NVP or Hyperemesis
- If persistent, consider Methylprednisolone 15–20 mg Q8H IV for up to 24H.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing NVP, escalating treatment based on severity and persistence.
