CPhA acknowledges the contribution of Dr. Amie Cullimore as the previous author of this chapter.CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “women” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware that this term is not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Natural menopause is defined as cessation of menses of 1 yearʼs duration secondary to lack of estrogen production by the ovaries and it marks the end of the reproductive life. The average age of menopause in Canada is 51,​[^[1]]​[^[2]] although the age of natural menopause can vary from age 40–58.​[^[3]] Menopause may also be induced by medical or surgical intervention such as radiation or chemotherapy treatment or removal of the ovaries at time of hysterectomy. Early menopause is defined as menopause before 45 years of age and premature is before 40 years of age. 

Perimenopause, otherwise known as the menopausal transition, begins with an alteration in menstrual cycle length and ends when natural menopause is reached. Symptoms of perimenopause are frequently similar to those of menopause.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), commonly known as hot flashes and night sweats, are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms experienced by 60–80% of individuals.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Reporting of bothersome VMS also varies among individuals with different cultural backgrounds.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] The onset of VMS in relation to the final menstrual period varies among individuals, with some reporting VMS up to 10 years before the final menstrual period.​[^[1]]​[^[6]] On average, VMS last for 7–8 years and tend to persist for 4.5 years after the final menstrual period.​[^[7]] Risk factors for a longer duration of VMS include having hot flashes at a younger age, high BMI, smoking, low education level, and having depressive symptoms, stress and anxiety. VMS can be severe enough in 20–25% of menopausal individuals to negatively affect quality of life.​[^[8]] 

Other associated complaints of menopause, including vaginal symptoms such as dryness, itchiness, vaginitis and dyspareunia, generally persist or worsen with aging due to low estrogen levels. Individuals tend to report vaginal symptoms a few years after the last menstrual period. Unlike hot flashes, vaginal atrophy does not improve over time. The combination of vaginal atrophy and urinary tract dysfunction (recurrent urinary tract infections, dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency) is referred to as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).​[^[9]] Some individuals notice decreasing libido and an alteration in sexual function with the onset of menopause (see Female Sexual Dysfunction); the cause of this change is multifaceted.

Sleep disturbances (difficulty sleeping, fragmented sleep), mood changes (depressive symptoms, anxiety), headaches and joint pain have also been reported during the menopausal transition. These symptoms may continue after the menopausal transition.

Figure 1 summarizes the management of VMS in menopausal patients.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Drugs for the treatment of menopausal symptoms are listed in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.

#### Vasomotor Symptoms

VMS have a significant impact on quality of life. Intolerance to heat, flushing and perspiration are uncomfortable and may be embarrassing. Hot flashes or night sweats can lead to sleepless nights, fatigue and decreased productivity at work.

#### Hormone Therapy

Hormone therapy (HT) refers to both **estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT)** for patients with an intact uterus and **estrogen therapy (ET)** alone for patients who have had a hysterectomy. HT is the most effective treatment for VMS and may be considered for patients <60 years of age or <10 years past menopause​[^[9]]​[^[21]] Absolute contraindications to estrogen and progestogen therapy are listed in Table 1.

Estrogen is indicated for the reduction of the frequency and severity of hot flashes in VMS.​[^[2]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]] A progestogen is indicated in patients with an intact uterus using systemic estrogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. With EPT, the estrogen is taken continuously every day and the progestogen can be taken either continuously every day (continuous EPT) or cyclically for 12–14 consecutive days every calendar month (cyclic EPT). During the first year of using continuous EPT, unexpected spotting or vaginal bleeding may occur. With the cyclic EPT, a patient can expect a withdrawal bleed when the progestogen is stopped at the end of the cycle. Both cyclic and continuous EPT regimens reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia; however, continuous EPT may be more effective at preventing endometrial hyperplasia than cyclic EPT.​[^[25]] In individuals without a uterus, ET alone should be used continuously throughout the month. 

Estrogen preparations used in the treatment of VMS include products administered by either the oral or transdermal (e.g., gel, patch) route. The non-oral route eliminates the first-pass effect through the liver, which results in less of an increase of triglyceride levels, as well as surrogate markers for thrombosis (i.e., C-reactive protein) and sex-hormone-binding globulin.​[^[21]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]] Compared to oral estrogen, low to standard doses of transdermal estrogen may be associated with a reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) but these findings are based on observational data only.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]] Other benefits of transdermal therapy include more consistent systemic estrogen levels compared with oral therapy.​[^[31]] Transdermal estrogen may be considered over oral estrogen in patients with migraines, high triglycerides, hypertension, malabsorption syndromes, low libido and shift workers.​[^[2]]

The North American Menopause (NAMS) 2017 hormone therapy position statement states that the appropriate dose, duration, regimen and route of administration of estrogen should be used to attain the treatment goals, benefits and least amount of risk.​[^[21]] Beginning with a low or standard dose of estrogen is reasonable, and the dose can be tailored to meet the patient’s needs. Lower initiating doses of estrogen may require a longer duration of treatment to reach response (e.g., 8–12 wk for improvement in HT with low-dose estrogen compared with 4 wk with standard-dose estrogen).​[^[26]] See Table 3 for low to standard starting doses for estrogen products. For patients who go into early or premature menopause, higher doses of estrogen may be required.​[^[9]]

The term *progestogen* includes both natural **progesterone** and synthetic progestins. A progestogen is indicated in patients with an intact uterus when using systemic estrogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Progestogen preparations include oral capsules, transdermal patches (in combination with estrogen) and levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). Although not a Health Canada–approved indication, LNG-IUS can also be used off-label to provide endometrial protection from estrogen therapy. Studies have shown that LNG-IUS 52 mg products can prevent endometrial hyperplasia from unopposed estrogen over a period of 5 years.​[^[32]] See Table 3 for progestogen doses required for low to standard doses of estrogen. Higher doses of progestogen may be required to balance higher doses of estrogen.

For perimenopausal patients, options include HT, combined hormonal contraceptives and LNG-IUS in combination with estrogen. Some clinicians and patients prefer the cyclic EPT regimen in perimenopausal patients to reduce the amount of breakthrough bleeding. Combined hormonal contraceptives or LNG-IUS are options during perimenopause for patients requiring contraception and/or control of irregular or heavy bleeding (see Contraception).

| Estrogen | Undiagnosed vaginal bleedingActive liver diseaseActive thromboembolic diseaseKnown or suspected carcinoma of the breast or other estrogen-sensitive tumorsPregnancyNote: The risk of recurrence of breast cancer or thrombosis following estrogen therapy is unknown. Caution is recommended in patients with cardiovascular disease. For all patients, the risk vs. the benefit must be considered when prescribing estrogen therapy. |

Consider oral progestogens as alternative treatments for VMS in symptomatic patients who cannot or who do not want to use estrogen therapy. In patients with an intact uterus using estrogen therapy, do not recommend topical progesterone cream because there is no evidence that it will provide adequate endometrial protection and prevent endometrial hyperplasia.​[^[33]] It is currently unknown whether progestogen monotherapy increases the risk of breast cancer.​[^[2]] 

Another option for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS in postmenopausal patients with an intact uterus is the Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex (TSEC), combining conjugated **estrogen with bazedoxifene**. Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an antagonist of estrogen receptors on endometrial and breast tissue and an agonist on bone. The bazedoxifene provides endometrial protection when combined with estrogen, therefore additional progestogen is not needed. In trials, the estrogen-bazedoxifene combination reduced hot flash frequency by 74% versus 51% with placebo at week 12 of treatment; patients experienced approximately 7–8 fewer hot flashes per day.​[^[34]] In addition to improving VMS, it avoids bothersome adverse effects of progestogens such as breast tenderness and uterine bleeding. Although not indicated, it also may be used in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and the prevention of osteoporosis.​[^[34]]

Tibolone is the most recent addition to HT products in Canada, indicated for the treatment of VMS in postmenopausal patients. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid analogue of norethynodrel, is metabolized to 3 active metabolites with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic activity.​[^[35]] In a Cochrane systematic review of randomized control trials (RCT), tibolone was more effective compared to placebo for reducing VMS in postmenopausal patients (7 RCTs), although slightly less effective than EPT (9 RCTs).​[^[36]] There is no need for additional progestogen therapy for patients taking tibolone.

There is no good evidence to suggest the best time to discontinue HT. Duration of HT use should be based on the individual patient and ongoing symptom relief. HT use should be reviewed periodically with the patient (e.g., annually) to determine if continued use is expected to result in ongoing benefit. Patients who start HT in early or premature menopause should continue HT until the average age of menopause.​[^[12]] When discontinuing HT, the dose can be gradually reduced to avoid abrupt discontinuation, though studies have not shown a difference between abrupt discontinuation or gradual tapering and the return of menopausal symptoms.​[^[37]]​[^[38]] If the patient becomes symptomatic with lower doses when tapering, continue that dose until the VMS abate.​[^[2]]

#### Compounded Bioidentical Hormone Therapy

The term *bioidentical* describes a product that contains hormones (e.g., **estriol, estradiol, estrone, progesterone**) that are chemically the same as those produced by the human ovary.​[^[39]] Bioidentical hormones are available in many Health Canada–approved prescription products (see Table 3). However, there are concerns regarding compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) with dosages prescribed based on salivary and blood testing of a patient’s hormone levels. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration states that there is no scientific basis for using saliva testing to adjust hormone levels; blood and salivary hormone levels fluctuate throughout the day.​[^[40]] There is also confusion generated due to the marketing of compounded BHT as being “natural,” as well as many of the misleading safety claims that are made.​[^[41]] The recently released evaluation report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) provided 6 key recommendations addressing the clinical utility of compounded BHT.​[^[42]] Recommendations include restricting the use of compounded BHT to patients with a documented allergy or requiring a specific dosage form. The NASEM committee also acknowledged the need for further research to assess the effectiveness, safety and use of compounded BHT.​[^[42]]

#### Risks Associated with Systemic Hormone Therapy

#### The Womenʼs Health Initiative

In the absence of an absolute contraindication to HT, risks associated with HT can be significantly minimized by careful consideration of the individual patient’s risk profile (e.g., age, existing CV risk factors, history of breast cancer) and the selection of the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use.

The Womenʼs Health Initiative (WHI), a long-term health study of menopausal women, was conducted to evaluate the strategies for the prevention and control of some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among aging women (cardiovascular disease, cancer). The WHI hormone therapy randomized controlled trials examined the health benefits and risks of HT for the primary prevention of chronic diseases in women 50–79 years of age. These trials included 2 arms: one enrolled 16 608 women to estrogen plus progestin (CE and medroxyprogesterone) and the other enrolled 10 739 women without a uterus to estrogen alone (CE only) versus placebo.​[^[43]]​[^[44]] The estrogen plus progestin was stopped early at 5.6 years because the risks of MI, VTE, stroke and breast cancer outweighed the benefits of reduced fractures and reduced incidence of colorectal cancer.​[^[43]] The estrogen alone was also stopped early at 7.2 years due to increased risk of stroke.​[^[44]] Of note, the average age of participants was 63 years and symptom improvement, such as reduction in VMS was not an objective in these trials. Reanalysis of the WHI data stratifying by both age and years since menopause has suggested that there is a “window of opportunity” as CVD risk increases when HT initiation is further away from the onset of menopause.​[^[45]] This is also referred to as the *timing hypothesis* where the beneficial effects are seen if HT is started before the development of atherosclerotic disease.​[^[46]] Women starting HT shortly after menopause are at low risk, but HT may be harmful if started ≥10 years after menopause or after the age of 60.​[^[21]]​[^[47]] In 2017, the cumulative 18-year follow-up of the WHI was published, showing no increase in all-cause, cardiovascular or cancer mortality with either estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone.​[^[48]]

See Table 2 for risks associated with hormone therapy.

| Risks | Evidence | Risk Management |
| Breast cancer | Increased risk of breast cancer events in WHI EPT (8 more/10 000 patients/y).Nonstatistically significant decreased risk of breast cancer with ET use alone (7 fewer breast cancer cases/10 000 patients/y).No increased risk of breast cancer mortality with EPT nor with ET alone in the long-term WHI follow-up (>20 y).​[49]A meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer showed that in patients of average weight, HT used for 5 y starting at age 50 would increase the absolute risk of breast cancer over a 20‑y age range (50–69 y) by 1 in every 50 users of continuous EPT, 70 users of cyclic EPT and 200 users of ET alone.​[50]Observational studies suggest that micronized progesterone may be associated with less risk of breast cancer compared to synthetic progestins.​[48]​[50]The use of HT in BRCA carriers does not negate the beneficial effects of risk-reducing bilateral oophorectomy.​[51]​[52] | Put breast cancer risk into perspective. For example, absolute risk of breast cancer with EPT after 5 y of use is very small, less than 0.1% (1 per 1000 patients/y).​[2] Estrogen only may have a lower risk compared to EPT.​[50]Avoid HT in a patient with a personal history of breast cancer; consider nonhormonal prescription options.Consider reducing modifiable risk factors for breast cancer such as smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake and managing weight. |
| Coronary heart disease | Non-statistically significant increased risk of CHD events (non-fatal MI) in WHI EPT (7 more per 10 000 patients/y).​[43]No increased risk of CHD events in the WHI ET alone.​[45]Reanalyses of WHI data showed increase in CHD risk if more than 10 y postmenopause or >60 y of age.​[44]Cochrane review of RCTs showed lowering of CHD risk if HT started within 10 y of menopause (RR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.96).​[47]No increase in CVD mortality with 18-y follow-up of WHI.​[48] | HT should not be used for cardiovascular protection.In symptomatic patients, HT may be considered within 10 y of menopause or in patients <60 y. Patients who start HT more than 10 y after menopause may have greater CVD risk.Patients at high risk of CVD (e.g., patients who have a history of VTE or CHD) should avoid HT and consider nonhormonal prescription options.Patients at moderate risk for CVD (e.g., additional risk factors for VTE or CHD such as smoking, high blood pressure) may want to consider transdermal or lower-dose estrogen. Consider reducing modifiable risk factors for CVD including smoking cessation, reducing blood pressure and managing weight. |
| Stroke | Increased risk of stroke in WHI EPT (8 more per 10 000 patients/y) and WHI ET alone (12 more/10 000 patients/y).Cochrane review of RCTs showed no increased risk of stroke if HT started within 10 y of menopause.​[47] |  |
| Venous thromboembolism | Increased risk of VTE in WHI EPT (18 more VTE per 10 000 patients/y) and WHI estrogen alone (7 more VTE per 10 000 patients/y).Observational studies suggest that low to standard doses of transdermal estrogen may have lower VTE risk compared to oral estrogen.​[28]​[29] |  |

#### Nonhormonal Pharmacological Therapies

Not all patients are candidates for HT or care to consider HT as a therapeutic option. Nonhormonal prescription options for VMS include antidepressants, gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin), clonidine and oxybutynin. Consider offering nonhormonal prescription options to patients with disruptive VMS if HT is contraindicated (see Table 1) or undesirable.

#### Antidepressants

A mild to moderate reduction in the frequency and/or severity of VMS has been shown with some SSRIs (e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine) and SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine).​[^[53]]​[^[54]] A quick onset of action can be expected with results usually seen within 2 weeks.​[^[55]] However, antidepressants do not offer some of the health benefits of HT (e.g., prevention of osteoporosis and genital atrophy).​[^[2]]

Several meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with SSRIs and SNRIs have shown that these agents are effective in reducing VMS frequency and severity in postmenopausal women.​[^[53]]​[^[54]]​[^[56]] Reduction in hot flashes varied among the studies from 25–69%, though there is a significant variability among the included studies.​[^[57]] These agents have also been shown to be effective with VMS in breast cancer survivors.​[^[58]] Other SSRIs have also been associated with a decrease in hot flash frequency compared to placebo.​[^[54]]​[^[55]] 

Paroxetine and fluoxetine should be avoided in breast cancer survivors receiving tamoxifen. These drugs are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 and may reduce the conversion of the tamoxifen to its active metabolite endoxifen.​[^[59]]

Consider antidepressants as first line nonhormonal pharmacologic options in patients experiencing VMS who also have significant perimenopausal/menopausal mood and anxiety concerns.​[^[54]]​[^[60]]

#### Gabapentinoids

A meta-analysis of 7 RCTs showed that gabapentin significantly reduces hot flash frequency (standardized mean difference 2.31 [95% CI 1.50–3.11]), duration ( 0.89 [95% CI 0.49–1.30] and composite score (2.31 [95% CI 1.50–3.11]) compared to placebo.​[^[61]]​[^[62]]. Doses of gabapentin in the trials included 300 mg/day, 900 mg/day and 1800 mg/day. As drowsiness is an adverse effect with gabapentin, it may be a good option as a nightly dose for patients complaining of night sweats and fragmented sleep. Some clinicians are starting gabapentin doses at 300 mg at night and increasing gradually up to 600–900 mg nightly.

Pregabalin has been less studied for VMS compared to gabapentin. Pregabalin 75 mg BID and 150 mg BID for 6 weeks of treatment significantly reduced hot flashes by 65% and 71%, respectively, compared with 50% with placebo.​[^[63]]

#### Other Nonhormonal Therapies

Clonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive, is indicated for the relief of VMS but is associated with side effects.​[^[2]] The anticholinergic oxybutynin 15 mg extended-release was shown in one RCT to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of VMS compared with placebo over 12 weeks.​[^[64]]

#### Natural Health Products

Natural health products including black cohosh, dong quai, evening primrose oil, flaxseed, ginseng, hops, maca, omega-3 fatty acids, pine bark, pollen extract and puerpuria all have either negative, insufficient or inconclusive data and should not be recommended until further data is available. Note that case reports link black cohosh to liver damage.​[^[65]]​[^[66]] Vitamin E (400–800 units daily) has a marginal effect on VMS.​[^[14]]​[^[67]]​[^[68]] A meta-analysis of plant-based therapies used for menopausal symptoms suggests that dietary and supplemental soy isoflavones may improve hot flash scores and vaginal dryness but not night sweats.​[^[69]] Whole soybean contains equal amounts of genistein and daidzein and a smaller amount of glycitein; all components may have different therapeutic outcomes. Gut bacteria metabolize daidzein to S-equol, which has been developed for patients who are unable to metabolize daidzein and may hold therapeutic promise, but further studies are warranted.​[^[14]]

#### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause

#### Local Hormone Therapy

**Vaginal estrogen**  therapy (creams, intravaginal tablets and/or estradiol-releasing ring) is used to treat the symptoms of GSM;​[^[70]] it may be considered in patients experiencing vaginal atrophy due to menopause.​[^[2]] In these patients, intravaginal administration is preferred because it results in less systemic estrogen absorption (and therefore reduced endometrial stimulation, uterine bleeding and breast tenderness) compared to oral or transdermal formulations.​[^[70]] Some patients who continue to have vaginal symptoms despite systemic HT will benefit from the addition of vaginal estrogen.​[^[71]] 

Vaginal estrogen also reduces the incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal patients.​[^[72]] Urinary incontinence may be improved with vaginal estrogen therapy, as indicated by 2 systematic reviews of patients with stress and/or urge incontinence.​[^[73]]​[^[74]] However, there was no evidence that improvement continued after vaginal estrogen was discontinued. In patients who received systemic estrogen, incontinence appeared to worsen compared to placebo. Other studies have suggested that vaginal estrogen does not appear to act synergistically with antimuscarinics (tolterodine) to improve overactive bladder, a condition similar to urge incontinence.​[^[75]]​[^[76]] 

When using recommended doses of vaginal estrogen, a progestogen is not indicated.​[^[70]]​[^[77]] Though the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen alone beyond 1 year has not been established in randomized control trials (as most trials were only 1 y in length), observational studies looking at longer-term use have shown no increase in risk.​[^[78]]​[^[79]] There is insufficient evidence to recommend one form of vaginal estrogen (e.g., tablet or cream) over another.​[^[70]]

The use of *vaginal* estrogen has not been shown to increase the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with a personal history of breast cancer or those currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer with tamoxifen.​[^[80]]​[^[81]]​[^[82]] More research is required before recommendations can be made regarding the use of vaginal estrogens in patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (where the goal of adjuvant therapy is a complete absence of estrogen at the tissue level).​[^[2]]​[^[82]] While nonhormonal therapies remain first line for managing urogenital symptoms during or after treatment for breast cancer, low-dose vaginal estrogen may be considered for patients with a history of breast cancer, including estrogen-dependent breast cancer, as well as in patients receiving tamoxifen.​[^[78]] The decision to initiate low-dose vaginal estrogen in these patients should involve a consultation with the oncologist and a thorough discussion of the benefits and potential risks. The lowest effective dose of vaginal estrogen should be used for the shortest possible time to achieve symptom improvement.​[^[9]]​[^[82]]

**Vaginal DHEA**, an inactive steroid, is converted to estrogen and androgen directly in the vaginal cells (a process called intracrinology). The vaginal DHEA prasterone was approved by Health Canada in 2019. The efficacy of prasterone on vaginal dryness and dyspareunia has been demonstrated in 12-week RCTs.​[^[83]]​[^[84]] The safety of prasterone on the endometrial lining has also been shown in a 52-week safety study.​[^[85]]

#### Nonhormonal Therapies

**Vaginal moisturizers** improve vaginal dryness and dyspareunia when used regularly (at least twice a week). A polycarbophil gel vaginal moisturizer was shown to be equivalent to local hormone therapy for improvement of dyspareunia.​[^[86]] Hyaluronic acid has also been shown to improve vaginal dryness and dyspareunia in small RCTs.​[^[78]] **Vaginal lubricants** can be used as needed (see Table 5).

#### Prevention of Osteoporosis with Hormone Therapy

Bone health should be preserved through exercise, diet, and adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. As the average Canadian does not meet all vitamin D requirements through diet, Osteoporosis Canada recommends supplementation with 800–2000 units of vitamin D per day for individuals who are >50 years of age or at risk of osteoporosis.​[^[87]] Hormone therapy may be considered as a first-line treatment for osteoporosis in patients who suffer from VMS and desire treatment for these symptoms.​[^[2]] Oral bisphosphonates, IV zoledronic acid and denosumab are first-line options for the treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of osteoporotic fractures in patients who do not have VMS (see Osteoporosis).

#### Mood Changes

Patients progressing through the menopausal transition may notice changes in mood resulting in anxiety and irritability, often compounded by sleeplessness. Patients at greatest risk of development of depression include those with a previous history of depressive disorders, poor physical health and a long menopausal transition.​[^[2]] Estrogen therapy has been shown to help with depressive disorders during the perimenopause; however, they may not be effective for depressive disorders in postmenopausal women.​[^[88]] Consider a trial of HT to alleviate depressive symptoms in perimenopausal patients particularly if also treating concurrent VMS.​[^[88]] Estrogen may also augment antidepressant therapy in perimenopausal patients.​[^[89]] CBT may also be helpful for depressive disorders or anxiety, and has been shown to improve sleep and VMS as well.​[^[88]] There is no clear evidence for SSRIs or SNRIs in easing low mood symptoms during menopause if the patient is not diagnosed with major depressive disorder.​[^[11]]

#### Cognition

Patients going through the menopause transition often complain of cognitive changes such as poor memory or “brain fog.” VMS, sleep issues and mood changes, such as depressive symptoms, may also contribute to cognitive changes.​[^[90]]​[^[91]] By reducing these symptoms in patients, improvement in cognitive changes may also be seen. In trials, HT has been shown to improve cognitive changes in patients who start immediately after early surgical menopause, though the same benefits have not been observed in natural postmenopausal patients.​[^[21]] The long-term effects of HT on cognitive decline such as with Alzheimer disease have had conflicting findings in studies, with some observational studies showing a protective effect,​[^[92]] while others indicating an increased risk.​[^[93]]

Less effect on hepatic sex-hormone binding globulin synthesis than oral estrogens.May benefit patients who report sexual dysfunction, who smoke, who have malabsorption conditions or high triglyceride levels. |
| **17-beta estradiol, topical gel** (Estrogel, Divigel) | Recommended starting dose: Estrogel: 0.75 mg estradiol per 1.25 g metered dose actuation. 0.75–1.5 mg (1–2 actuations) applied dailyDivigel (0.1%): 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg estradiol per packet. Apply 1 packet daily | Breakthrough bleeding/spotting, nausea, headache, bloating/water retention, breast tenderness.Redness, skin irritation. | Avoids first-pass effect. Less effect on hepatic sex-hormone binding globulin synthesis than oral estrogens.May benefit patients who report sexual dysfunction, who smoke, who have malabsorption conditions or high triglyceride levels.Estrogel: may be applied to abdomen or inner thighs (but not breasts). Do not rotate application site. Divigel: alternate application site between left and right thigh. Application area should be 5 × 7 in. |

Concomitant progestogen therapy is not required when using tibolone. |
| **medroxyprogesterone acetate** (Provera, generics) | In combination with estrogen in patients with intact uterus.Recommended starting dose: Cyclic regimen: 5 mg daily PO, first 12 days of every monthContinous regimen: 2.5 mg daily PO | Bloating, irritability, mood swings, breast tenderness, headache, water retention, breakthrough bleeding/spotting. | Progestogens normalize the endometrial response and decrease breakthrough bleeding; when given continuously, they prevent menstrual blood flow. |
| **norethindrone acetate** (Norlutate) | Recommended starting dose: 5 mg daily PO | Bloating, irritability, mood swings, breast tenderness, headache, water retention, breakthrough bleeding/spotting. | Progestogens normalize the endometrial response and decrease breakthrough bleeding; when given continuously, they prevent menstrual blood flow. |
