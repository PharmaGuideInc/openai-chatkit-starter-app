#### Introduction

The term opioid refers to both naturally occurring compounds (e.g., morphine) and synthetic agents (e.g., oxycodone, heroin). The prevalence of opioid-related disorders in Canada has rapidly escalated into an opioid crisis. The opioid-related death rate in Ontario rose from 3 per 100 000 in 2003 to 19 per 100 000 in 2021.​[^[1]] In 2022, the rate of apparent opioid toxicity deaths in British Columbia was 45.3 per 100 000.​[^[2]] Opioid toxicity deaths are associated with more potential years of life lost than alcohol-related disorders.​[^[3]] The majority of reported deaths occur in people who are young or middle-aged (20–59 years of age).​[^[2]]

Opioid-related disorders have a significant impact on health, productivity and social problems, e.g., intimate partner violence, impaired driving and theft. The treatment of opioid-related disorders requires a biopsychosocial approach. This chapter focuses on the following components of opioid-related disorders: opioid use disorder (OUD), opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal (for diagnostic criteria, see Table 1). Prevention of morbidity/mortality through safer opioid prescribing is also discussed.

Complications of OUD may include: 



#### Goals of Therapy



| Opioid-Related Disorder | Diagnostic Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Opioid Use DisorderCode based on current severity/remission: If an opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (see the coding note for opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced depressive disorder and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced depressive code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive disorder or F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive disorder.Specify current severity/remission:(F11.10) Mild: Presence of 2−3 symptoms.(F11.11) Mild, In early remission(F11.11) Mild, In sustained remission(F11.20) Moderate: Presence of 4−5 symptoms.(F11.21) Moderate, In early remission(F11.21) Moderate, In sustained remission(F11.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.(F11.21) Severe, In early remission(F11.21) Severe, In sustained remission | A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use.A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the opioid or recover from its effects.Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use.Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired effect.A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid.Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision.Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for opioid withdrawal).Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those individuals taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision.Specify if:In early remission: After full criteria of opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception of Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).In sustained remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception of Criterion A4, “Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids,” may be met).Specify if:On maintenance therapy: This additional specifier is used if the individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the agonist). This category also applies to those individuals being maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist, or a full antagonist such as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone.In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to opioids is restricted. |
| Opioid IntoxicationCoding note: The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and whether or not there are perceptual disturbances.For opioid intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.120, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.220. If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.920.For opioid intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.122, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.222. If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F11.922. | Recent use of an opioid.Clinically significant problematic behavioural or psychological changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, opioid use.Pupillary constriction (or pupillary dilation due to anoxia from severe overdose) and one (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after, opioid use:Drowsiness or coma.Slurred speech.Impairment in attention or memory.The signs and symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.Specify if:With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted in the rare instance in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. |
| Opioid WithdrawalCoding note: The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder. If a mild opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.13, and if a moderate or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.23. For opioid withdrawal occurring in the absence of an opioid use disorder (e.g., in a patient taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision), the ICD-10-CM code is F11.93. | Presence of either of the following:Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer).Administration of an opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use.Three (or more) of the following developing within minutes to several days after Criterion A:Dysphoric mood.Nausea or vomiting.Muscle aches.Lacrimation or rhinorrhea.Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating.Diarrhea.Yawning.Fever.Insomnia.The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.The signs and symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. |

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Preventive Therapy

Guidelines for safer opioid prescribing have been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality (e.g., addiction and overdose) secondary to prescription opioid use.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Consider the following principles for safer opioid management:



#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



| Stage of Change​[6]​[7] | Motivational Interviewing Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Precontemplation | Encourage patients to openly discuss their opioid use. Discuss health consequences of opioid use, but avoid confrontational or judgmental comments or body language. |
| Contemplation | Encourage patients to list pros/cons of opioid use; create a “decisional balance” weighing out the items on each side. Be understanding if the patient expresses ambivalence, and be encouraging. Provide positive reinforcement of any “change talk.” |
| Preparation | Work on practical elements of planning the quit attempt. Discuss treatment options, including psychosocial treatment, need for withdrawal management and opioid agonist maintenance treatment. Address any concerns and provide information on options. |
| Action | Monitor progress. Provide positive reinforcement for any successes. Troubleshoot any difficulties encountered. |
| Maintenance | Continue to provide positive reinforcement of successes. Work on relapse-prevention skills and self-management techniques. Build a community-based support network to sustain motivation to maintain success. |
| Relapse | Normalize relapse as a part of any change process and, more particularly, as part of the disease of addiction. Frame relapse as a learning opportunity and not as a failure. Emphasize that excessive guilt can lead to shame, which may worsen the relapse. Reassess current stage of change; use motivational approaches to help guide patient back into preparation phase. |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

The integration of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment is considered best practice for the management of OUD. Educate patients about the relapsing and remitting nature of substance use disorders. Reassure them that relapse can be a normal part of the process and that the practitioner is available to help when this occurs.

#### Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal and Opioid Use Disorder

#### Acute Withdrawal/Detoxification

Maintenance therapy with a long-acting agonist such as methadone or the partial agonist buprenorphine continues to be the most effective treatment for OUD. Detoxification alone is not recommended due to high risk of overdose upon relapse following loss of opioid tolerance. Detoxification in pregnancy should also be avoided due to risk of spontaneous abortion.

In rare circumstances, clonidine may be used for withdrawal management. Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that decreases the neuronal output of norepinephrine and can blunt the noradrenergic symptoms of withdrawal such as chills and flushing. Other symptoms, e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches and cravings, usually persist. Clonidine also carries a risk of hypotension.​[^[12]] Clonidine is typically used as an adjunct therapy during tapering of maintenance therapies or to manage the side effect of sweating.

#### Maintenance Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder

See Figure 1 for the management of OUD. More information about drugs used in the treatment of OUD, including advantages and disadvantages, can be found in Table 3.

Opioid agonist maintenance treatment is superior to detoxification with respect to prevention of relapse, overdose and treatment retention.​[^[13]] Unfortunately, stigma and misunderstanding regarding these therapies among both the general population and health practitioners continue to present barriers to their access by those who could benefit.​[^[14]] Currently, there are 2 maintenance therapies with indications for the treatment of moderate to severe OUD: buprenorphine (first line) and methadone (second line). Slow-release morphine is an off-label third-line option frequently used as an adjunct during methadone initiation or as standalone therapy for those patients who have failed methadone or buprenorphine.​[^[15]] Other agents, such as diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone, are being studied to determine their efficacy as maintenance therapies when other therapies fail.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor and an antagonist at other receptors, e.g., kappa. It is associated with increased treatment retention and a reduction in opioid use.​[^[16]] Buprenorphine dosing must be individualized and varies for the induction, titration/stabilization and maintenance phases.​[^[17]] With a very long half-life and once-daily or even alternate-day sublingual dosing, buprenorphine can be a useful option in remote communities with limited access to pharmacies. Due to its high affinity for the mu opioid receptor, buprenorphine will displace other full agonist opioids and may cause precipitated withdrawal. Off-label induction protocols, including microdosing and macrodosing (the latter should be reserved for supervised settings), reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]

In Canada, several formulations of buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD are available. In addition to the once-daily sublingual (combined with naloxone to deter intravenous use) tablet and film, an extended-release once-monthly subcutaneous injection may offer a beneficial alternative for patients who have difficulty adhering to a treatment that requires daily dosing. As specified by Health Canada, health-care professionals must complete a certification program to be eligible to prescribe, dispense or administer the subcutaneous formulation.​[^[20]]

Methadone is a full mu opioid receptor agonist typically given once daily for the treatment of moderate to severe OUD. It is associated with increased treatment retention and a reduction in opioid use, mortality and transmission of HIV.​[^[16]]​[^[21]]

Higher *maintenance* doses (methadone 60–120 mg or buprenorphine/naloxone 8–24 mg/day) are more effective than lower doses. The usual minimum recommended length of treatment is 12 months; high relapse rates even after 1 year of treatment mean that many patients will need long-term treatment. Studies show slightly higher rates of treatment retention with methadone than with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, initiation with buprenorphine/naloxone is safer than methadone and is often easier to access in primary care. Buprenorphine/naloxone is also less likely to cause drug interactions, hormonal effects such as erectile dysfunction, and cognitive or psychomotor impairment.​[^[22]] 

Naltrexone is a long-acting mu opioid antagonist that blocks the effect of opioids. It has mixed evidence supporting its use for OUD​[^[23]] and is usually recommended only as an alternative treatment.​[^[15]] Poor medication adherence with oral naltrexone is a barrier to successful treatment and therefore observed ingestion is preferred where possible.​[^[23]] Injectable naltrexone is not currently available in Canada but may be effective in certain highly motivated populations such as physicians and other safety-sensitive professionals.​[^[24]] Results of a randomized clinical non-inferiority trial of a monthly injectable form of naltrexone suggest it may be as effective as oral buprenorphine/naloxone therapy.​[^[25]] 

Optimal long-term results are obtained with opioid maintenance therapy (methadone or buprenorphine) combined with nonpharmacological treatment including psychoeducation, individual and group psychotherapy, relapse prevention training, and peer support. Concurrent psychiatric problems should also be treated in tandem with the OUD. If the discontinuation of opioid maintenance therapy is considered, the best outcomes occur with slow tapering over many weeks.​[^[26]]

#### Opioid Toxicity/Overdose

Unintentional fatal opioid overdose in patients with or without OUD has increased drastically over the last 2 decades.​[^[27]] Symptoms of opioid toxicity/overdose include respiratory depression (shallow breathing, respiratory rate <12 breaths per min), constricted pupils, pale/cold skin, blue fingernails and being unresponsive to painful stimuli (see Table 1 for diagnostic criteria).​[^[28]] Opioid overdose is considered a medical emergency, and the patient should be transferred to an acute care hospital via emergency medical services. While awaiting emergency services, CPR should be initiated and, if available, naloxone, an opioid antagonist used to temporarily reverse opioid overdose, should be administered. More than 1 dose of naloxone may be required if no effect is seen within 3–5 minutes or if the initial effect wears off while awaiting the arrival of emergency services.

While previously available only in supervised medical settings such as emergency departments, both intramuscular and intranasal naloxone are now widely available for use in community settings. Take-home naloxone is recommended for all OUD patients, patients taking opioids for pain and individuals in their support system.​[^[29]] Availability of some take-home naloxone products may vary from province to province. For take-home naloxone dosing information, see Table 4.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Pregnancy

Universal screening for substance use disorders during the first prenatal visit is recommended, followed by brief intervention and referral to treatment, if indicated.​[^[30]] Pregnancy complications of uncontrolled opioid use include pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, low birth weight and meconium aspiration. Neonatal complications include neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, microcephaly, growth delay and neurodevelopmental problems.​[^[31]] The incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is increasing in parts of Canada.​[^[32]] In some Ontario communities, up to 17% of newborns were exposed to nonprescribed opioids.​[^[33]]

#### Management in Pregnancy

As in nonpregnant patients, initiation of maintenance therapy is considered the standard of care in the management of OUD in pregnancy.​[^[34]] Detoxification carries a heightened risk of spontaneous abortion. Recent evidence suggests that buprenorphine is as safe and effective as methadone in pregnancy and is associated with a lower incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.​[^[15]]​[^[29]] When buprenorphine is used, the single-entity tablet (without naloxone) is preferred when available.​[^[34]] However, Canadians have no practical access to this product, and expert consensus supports the continuation of combination buprenorphine/naloxone tablet. The subcutaneous formulation is not safe to use in pregnancy.

#### Management in Breastfeeding

Use of methadone while breastfeeding may ameliorate withdrawal symptoms in the infant through transfer of approximately 2.8% of the maternal dose to breast milk. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics considers any maternal dose of methadone to be compatible with breastfeeding,​[^[35]] doses above 100 mg/day may increase risk of sedation and respiratory depression in the infant, and more so if the baby was not exposed to methadone in utero.​[^[36]] Cases of serious harm, including death, although rare, have been reported in association with methadone exposure in breastfed infants.​[^[37]] Transfer of buprenorphine into breast milk is lower compared with methadone.​[^[38]]

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommend breastfeeding for individuals taking either methadone or buprenorphine, provided they are HIV negative and have no other contraindications.​[^[34]]​[^[39]] Infants should be observed for increased sedation and respiratory depression; it is important to educate parents about identifying these symptoms in their babies.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

#### Assessment

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) refers specifically to neonatal withdrawal from opioid exposure in utero. The onset of symptoms is usually 48–72 hours after birth for most opioids and about 4–14 days for methadone. Expression of NOWS is widely variable and is unrelated to the maternal maintenance therapy dose.​[^[40]] Clinical manifestations relate to the central/autonomic nervous systems and the GI tract. Affected infants display a characteristic high-pitched cry, as well as irritability, insomnia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor and seizures. They often experience vomiting, diarrhea, feeding problems, sweating, yawning, tachypnea, congestion/sneezing and fever. It is important to evaluate for other alternative diagnoses, including neonatal sepsis, meningitis, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia or colic.

There are several scoring systems for assessment and guiding treatment of NOWS; the modified Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (31 items) is the most widely used for both research and treatment.​[^[40]] The Finnegan score is assessed every 2–4 hours.

#### Management

NOWS is managed in an inpatient hospital setting. Nonpharmacologic treatment is the standard of care for babies with NOWS and includes rooming-in with parents/caregivers, swaddling, holding, gentle rocking, pacifier use, frequent small feeds with hypercaloric formula, frequent diaper changes with barrier ointment, and most importantly an environment that is quiet and has low light and white noise.​[^[41]] Rooming-in is associated with lower withdrawal scores than being in the neonatal intensive care unit.​[^[42]]

For infants with moderate to severe withdrawal, pharmacotherapy may provide additional benefits. A Cochrane review compared opioid treatment with supportive care alone, phenobarbital or diazepam.​[^[43]] Compared with supportive care alone, opioid treatment resulted in reduction in time to regain birth weight and shorter duration of supportive care, but longer hospital stay (possibly due to a policy-based requirement necessitating hospitalization in order to receive opioids). Opioid therapy (e.g., tincture of opium, morphine, methadone or paregoric) reduced seizure incidence and special care nursery admissions compared with phenobarbital, and reduced treatment failure (inadequate control of symptoms, requirement for additional pharmacotherapy, seizures, mortality) compared with diazepam.

#### Management of Older Adults

While OUD is less common among older adults compared to younger patients, opioids and benzodiazepines are the prescription drugs most frequently associated with a substance use disorder in this population.​[^[44]] Older patients are more sensitive to the sedating effects of these drugs and are more susceptible to falls, memory impairment, impaired reaction time and behavioural problems. The prevalence of polypharmacy further compounds the problem. Adherence to safe opioid prescribing guidelines is of particular importance in this population. Substance use disorders are generally underdiagnosed in older adults; screening is critical and should include family, friends or caregivers for collateral information, where possible. Opioid agonist maintenance treatments remain the standard in this population; however, titration should follow the guidelines for high-risk groups due to the elevated risk of sedation and overdose.

**Drug Class: Alpha2-adrenergic Agonists**


**Drug Class: Opioid Agonists**


**Drug Class: Partial Opioid Agonists**

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **clonidine** (generics) | 0.1–0.2 mg Q6–8H PO PRN for 5–7 days | Sedation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension (often limits dosing), dizziness. | Additive effects with other CNS depressants such as ethanol and opioids. | Blunts some withdrawal symptoms, e.g., chills, flushing. Not recommended as a sole treatment for OUD, given lack of evidence for efficacy in addition to high risk of opioid overdose if patient relapses due to loss of tolerance. More often used as an adjunct agent during tapering of maintenance therapies or to manage sweating that occurs as a side effect of methadone or buprenorphine.Use with caution in those with heart disease and hypertension. Prolonged use of clonidine may result in rebound hypertension; taper slowly. Maintain fluid intake and monitor for hypotensive effects; hold next dose if blood pressure <85/55 mm Hg. |
| **methadone** (Methadose, Metadol-D, Odan-Methadone, generics) | Initiate as per provincial guidelines, 5–30 mg starting dose depending on risk stratification; may increase by 5–15 mg Q3 days until dose of 60–80 mg reached and then may increase by 5–10 mg Q7 daysMaintenance: 40–80 mg/day PO; higher maintenance doses (60–100 mg) associated with better outcomes, especially in powdered fentanyl users who develop a very high tolerance to opioids and who may require doses over 120 mg | Sedation, respiratory depression, dizziness, hypotension, diaphoresis, weight gain, erectile dysfunction, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, QTc prolongation (monitored via ECG following risk factor assessment). | Contraindicated with high-risk QTc prolonging agents, e.g., citalopram, domperidone, fluoxetine, amiodarone; CNS depressants may increase risk of sedation and respiratory depression; CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors may decrease/increase methadone serum levels. | Advantages: Potent opioid agonist; does not precipitate withdrawal; potentially superior treatment retention. Disadvantages: Greater risk of overdose during initiation; longer time to reach maintenance dose (>35 days); less tolerable adverse effects; more drug interactions; greater risk of misuse compared with buprenorphine/naloxone and thus more likely to require daily witnessed ingestion. |
| **buprenorphine** (Suboxone, generics) | Long-term maintenance: 8–24 mg (buprenorphine) daily SL. Dose is usually initiated at 2–4 mg (to a total maximum of 12 mg on first day) and titrated to the lowest effective maintenance dose | Hyperhidrosis, respiratory depression, abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia. | Metabolized by CYP 3A4; inducers/inhibitors may alter buprenorphine plasma levels. Monitor accordingly. Decreased efficacy of opioid analgesics; contraindicated with drugs at moderate-high risk of causing QTc prolongation, e.g., citalopram, domperidone, amiodarone, quetiapine; CNS depressants may increase risk of sedation and respiratory depression; increased toxicity of MAO-inhibitors. | If switching from methadone or fentanyl powder, start at least 24 h, preferably 72 h, after last dose or use a microdosing protocol.​[17] Alternate-day dosing may be an option for some patients.Advantages: Lower risk of overdose; reduced risk of misuse/abuse compared with methadone; more flexible take-home dosing; shorter time to reach maintenance dose (1–3 days); easier to reinitiate after missed doses; fewer drug interactions; milder withdrawal syndrome. Disadvantages: Possible higher risk of treatment drop-out; may precipitate withdrawal if started incorrectly; may antagonize the effects of other opioids used for pain control; patients require education on SL dosing technique; treating overdose can be challenging due to high affinity for opioid receptors and long half-life. |
| **buprenorphine** (Sublocade) | Induction: buprenorphine/naloxone SL 8–24 mg daily SL x 7 days or more. Transition to buprenorphine SC 300 mg once a month x 2 months Maintenance: 100 mg SC once a month. Dose can be increased up to 300 mg if clinical response is not satisfactory | Constipation, nausea, vomiting, injection site pain/pruritis, fatigue headache, dry mouth, elevated hepatic enzymes. | Benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, beta blockers. Avoid alcohol; it increases the sedative effect of opioids.Avoid concomitant administration with drugs causing QTc prolongation.Avoid administration with drugs that affect electrolyte levels, e.g., loop/thiazide diuretics, laxatives, enemas, amphotericin B, high-dose corticosteroids, PPIs.Naltrexone can block the effect of buprenorphine.CYP 3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine.CYP 3A4 inducers may reduce plasma concentration of buprenorphine. | Available only through controlled distribution process.Patients of childbearing age should use reliable and effective birth control.Monitor patient for withdrawal for several months—may be detectable for 12+ months. |

**Drug Class: Opioid Antagonists**

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **naloxone** (generics) | 0.4 mg IM; may repeat dose Q5 min PRN | Due to induction of opioid withdrawal, e.g., nausea, vomiting, reversal of analgesia, sweating, hyperventilation. | No significant drug interactions. | Naloxone’s duration of action is 20–90 min; however, the opioid’s duration may be much longer (especially buprenorphine and methadone). It is thus imperative that monitoring for the recurrence of overdose symptoms occurs for at least 4–6 h after the last dose of naloxone.​[28] When naloxone is used, emergency medical services (i.e., 911) should always be called to transfer for ongoing monitoring. |
| **naloxone** (Narcan Nasal Spray) | 1 spray (4 mg/spray) intranasally; may repeat dose Q2–3 min in alternate nostrils PRN | Nasal edema, inflammation, dryness, congestion.Due to induction of opioid withdrawal, e.g., nausea, vomiting, reversal of analgesia, sweating, hyperventilation. | No significant drug interactions. | Each spray device contains only 1 dose; a new device is needed for each additional dose. If no response is obtained after 5 doses of the 4 mg spray, an opioid overdose is unlikely.Naloxone’s duration of action is 20–90 min; however, the opioid’s duration may be much longer (especially buprenorphine and methadone). It is thus imperative that monitoring for the recurrence of overdose symptoms occurs for at least 4–6 h after the last dose of naloxone.​[28] When naloxone is used, emergency medical services (i.e., 911) should always be called to transfer for ongoing monitoring. |
