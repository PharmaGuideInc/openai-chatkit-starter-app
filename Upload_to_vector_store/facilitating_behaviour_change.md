#### Introduction

Changing behaviour is the culmination of a complex set of thoughts, beliefs, motivations and actions. Maintaining a new behaviour over time requires continued motivation, engagement and interest. Individuals are ultimately responsible for their own health. Health-care practitioners cannot dictate or be responsible for a patient’s behaviour; they can only help facilitate positive behaviours that improve a person’s health and well-being. Effectively managing a medical condition almost always requires some type of short- or long-term behaviour change. For example, the change could be adhering to a medication regimen, exercising regularly, decreasing dietary fat or salt, reducing body weight, stopping smoking, or monitoring blood pressure or blood glucose.

Pharmacists and technicians must understand how to facilitate behaviour change to support patient health. Yet, changing behaviour can be challenging, whether it is supporting a patient in changing a behaviour to improve their health status or a colleague in implementing changes in their practice.

This chapter introduces a motivational-interviewing approach explicitly designed to help pharmacists tackle conversations about behaviour change, outlines a collection of proven communication strategies for motivational interviewing and demonstrates its application in pharmacy practice. Pharmacists become the “guide on the side” and help patients persuade themselves to make a change that would be beneficial at this point in their lives. These strategies help pharmacists talk patients through the benefits and drawbacks of change without pushing, preaching or persuading.

#### What Is Motivational Interviewing?

Motivational interviewing (MI) arose from the observation that health information alone rarely changes behaviour. Consider that the vast majority of people know healthy eating requires a focus on fruits and vegetables,​[^[1]] yet less than a third of Canadians eat five or more servings a day.​[^[2]] Knowing what should be done is necessary but not sufficient. This applies to many aspects of health and wellness. 

To overcome the inertia of behavioural change, Miller and Rollnick define MI as “a directive, client-centered counseling style for eliciting behavioral change by helping clients explore and resolve ambivalence.”​[^[3]] The principles of MI provide insight on how pharmacists can explore medication adherence and other behaviour changes with patients in a non-judgmental and non-threatening way.​[^[4]] Instead of starting a patient encounter with an overview of the general health information, pharmacists can learn to uncover the patient’s frame of reference and provide information that is personalized for a specific patient. 

Research suggests that the use of MI skills contributes to positive patient outcomes.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] In a meta-analysis, Rubak et al. found that the evoking style of MI outperformed advice-giving in approximately 70% of randomized controlled trials and was not more time-consuming.​[^[5]] In a similar meta-analysis, it was found that 55% of a variety of patient types had improved health outcomes across differing health-care settings and intensity of MI interventions.​[^[6]] Both studies included a broad range of areas, including obesity, cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use and hypertension control.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Finally, a third meta-analysis reported that MI improves self-reported and objective medication adherence measures compared with usual care.​[^[7]]

Motivational interviewing has taken many forms, and examples are outlined in Table 1. All approaches focus on the *importance of strong relational skills* and *specific skills sets*.​[^[12]] This chapter focuses on the application of one example, *MI for Health Care Professionals: A Sensible Approach*.​[^[11]] This model aligns with the patient-care process, avoids threats to patients’ autonomy and addresses patients’ understanding of medications.

#### Motivational Interviewing Relational Skills

#### Patient-centred care

Patient-centred care prioritizes placing the patient first in everything pharmacists do daily. It is about taking a sincere interest and using the available time to focus on the patient. All pharmacy organizations, schools, associations and corporate pharmacies sign on to a vision of optimal drug therapy outcome through patient-centred care.​[^[13]]

In self-care, patients use their medication knowledge and lived experiences to make health decisions, often independent of the health-care system. Many of these decisions, which fall along the self-care continuum toward healthy living, are considered the individual’s responsibility. Pharmacists are familiar with providing valuable advice to support self-care for minor and common ailments, but less so for lifestyle issues, particularly those that require behavioural changes. 

Pharmacists may feel discomfort in motivating people to change, in part as patients often appear to resist such advice. Using a patient-centred lens, pharmacists can reframe patients’ resistance as valuable information. Patients are not difficult or lying to hide “poor” behaviour, but instead are taking a risk and sharing sensitive information. While patients may not directly ask, they usually prefer a personalized plan that recognizes their perspectives about their health and is tailored to their needs. This includes minimally disruptive care where clinicians reduce the burden of managing their health by placing a patient’s convenience first over their own;​[^[14]] for example, reducing a patient’s pill burden and dosing schedule. 

#### Avoid threats to patients’ competency and autonomy

To change behaviour, individuals first must realize that the current behaviour is not working for them. In society, it can be embarrassing or even distressing to admit your current behaviour is harmful to your health. Individuals generally wish to appear competent and autonomous. The desire to present our best selves in interpersonal interactions is referred to as “face.”​[^[15]] Conversations that directly challenge the patient’s current behaviour with statements to convey important medical information such as “Don’t you know you need to start testing your blood sugars twice daily?” may create defensiveness in patients. If the logic of this statement is repeated, the patient may continue to resist. Why? The clinician is *inadvertently* implying the patient is not competent to make their own decisions about managing diabetes. These threats to a patient’s sense of autonomy and competence (i.e., face) occur when a patient shares a concern and the pharmacist’s response is dismissive. For example, if a patient is not testing their blood sugars, an ineffective pharmacist response may include: 



In place of statements to correct the patient’s behaviour, ask a question to explore their understanding. For example, “What do you think about testing blood sugars?” might allow the patient to share their thoughts about blood glucose testing. 

#### Patients’ sense-making and practical reasoning

Patients understand and monitor their health in ways that make sense to them using their own experience and abilities to act on health information (i.e., health literacy). While patients use practical reasoning to make sense of their health, they may lack the medical expertise to see the complete picture. For example, a patient may feel dizzy and weak when their blood sugar is low; thus, they believe that they can tell when their blood sugar is high or low. Based on this practical reasoning, the patient believes that blood sugar testing is not needed. If a clinician advises a patient to test blood sugars more often without recognizing and addressing the patient’s practical reasoning, the patient’s sense of competency may be threatened, resulting in less openness to behaviour change.​[^[16]] Practical reasoning is also referred to as self-regulation​[^[17]] or the patient’s medication experience.​[^[18]] To support a patient’s competency and autonomy when talking about behaviour change, the clinician can tap into the patient’s understanding of the disease, medication or behaviour. Understanding and discussion allow for the co-creation of patient-centred solutions to medication challenges. 

#### Motivational Interviewing Key Skills

The four steps in MI are outlined in Figure 1 and Figure 2: develop rapport, reframe the problem, provide tailored information, and plan next steps with specific skills and a sample conversation.​[^[11]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart titled "1. Develop Rapport," designed to guide a conversation between a healthcare provider (RP) and a patient (Pt). It outlines steps for initiating and conducting a discussion about medication use, specifically bisacodyl.

### Flowchart Structure:

1. **Greet Patient / Use Small Talk**
   - **RP:** "Hi Ms. D. My name is [x]. How’s your day going so far?"
   - **Pt:** "Okay, this is the last stop of the day."

2. **Ask to Start the Conversation**
   - **Decision Point:**
     - **No:** 
       - **Pt:** "Not now. Life is too busy for any changes."
       - **RP:** "Thanks for letting me know you are not ready to talk. I would like to help and I’m here any time."
       - **Note:** Follow-up at next visit. If there is a safety concern, share the risk and a safer plan. Document.
     - **Yes:**
       - **RP:** "I’m glad you could stop in. Is it okay if we take a few minutes to talk about your [bisacodyl]?"
       - **Pt:** "Well, I keep taking my [bisacodyl], so I’m okay but I have a moment to chat."

3. **Ask Open Question**
   - **RP:** "Tell me a bit more."
   - **Pt:** "Well, I’ve been told to get off these pills more times than I can count."

4. **Reflect Understanding**
   - **RP:** "You are aware that there are some downsides to long-term use."
   - **Pt:** "Yes, I know it can make your bowels lazy. Mine could’ve stopped working on their own."

5. **Reflect Feeling and Reasoning**
   - **RP:** "You’re worried that [bisacodyl] is doing more harm than good. Is that it?"
   - **Pt:** "Yes, you can’t turn back time. Also, I need the pills. I know being stopped up sounds minor, but it’s painful."

6. **Reflect Feeling**
   - **RP:** "So, you’re also concerned about the pain returning and it being brushed off as minor or just a part of life again."
   - **Pt:** "Yes, that’s it."

7. **Continue to Figure 2**

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to guide a conversation between a healthcare provider (RP) and a patient (Pt) regarding treatment plans. It is a continuation from a previous figure and consists of several steps:

1. **Continued from Figure 1**

2. **Reframe Problem**
   - **Reframe problem**: 
     - RP: "It sounds like if we had a plan that prevented your pain, you might consider stopping."
     - Pt: "Could you do that?"

3. **Provide Tailored Information**
   - **Elicit willingness**:
     - If "No":
       - Pt: "Not now. Life is too busy for any changes."
       - RP: "Thanks for letting me know you are not ready to talk. I would like to help and I’m here any time."
       - (Follow-up at next visit)
       - (If there is a safety concern, share the risk and a safer plan. Document.)
     - If "Yes":
       - RP: "Yes, would it be okay if I shared information with you about treating constipation and got your thoughts?"
       - Pt: "Sure."
       - RP: "First of all, any damage isn’t permanent."
       - Pt: "That’s good to hear."
       - RP: "Many patients had success with plans to slowly come off the [bisacodyl] while trying other options. The plan can also include using [bisacodyl] occasionally to prevent painful constipation."

   - **Elicit reaction**:
     - If "No":
       - Return to previous steps or reassess.
     - If "Yes":
       - RP: "How does that sound to you?"
       - Pt: "Okay, let’s give it a try."

4. **Plan Next Step**
   - **Plan next step (offer options)**:
     - RP: "I really appreciate it. There are a few options. You could adjust the fibre in your diet, increase your fluids or consider a fibre supplement."
     - Pt: "All are reasonable, what do you think?"
     - RP: "If it were me, I would start by looking at the fibre in my diet."
     - Pt: "Okay, let’s start there."
     - RP: "Great. [start detailed education and plan]"

The flowchart is structured to facilitate a patient-centered approach, allowing for patient input and shared decision-making.

#### 1. Develop rapport and start the conversation

Patients overwhelmingly want to be recognized as individuals and treated respectfully, non-judgmentally and with interest. Greet patients by their names (if possible) and take a minute for small talk: “Hi Margaret. How are you today?” Listen for insight into the patient’s perspective. Taking a moment to connect with patients shows them that you recognize and value them as individuals. This small gesture can make a significant different in their experience. Starting the conversation about behaviour change is often the most challenging part.



#### 2. Reframe the problem

After acknowledging the issue and practical reasoning, it is easy and familiar to jump to providing education. However, patients may not be ready or primed for new ideas. Reframing the issue illuminates new aspects and creates a more natural opportunity for sharing tailored medical expertise.​[^[19]] There are 2 approaches to reframing.

First, Miller and Rollnick refer to reframing as creating discrepancies where clinicians make a patient’s ambivalence about the behaviour explicit.​[^[10]] Examples include, “So on the one hand, you are hesitant to use steroids as they are chemicals, but on the other hand, you like how effectively they clear up your eczema.” Verbalizing ambivalence is a power tool that motivates change by creating cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort experienced when individuals simultaneously hold 2 or more conflicting ideas.​[^[20]] People have a motivational drive to reduce internal dissonance. In this step, guide the change process by stating the problem in the patient’s own words. 

Second, Berger and Villaume expand reframing statements to include a patient’s practical reasoning and contrast it with their goals or concerns.​[^[19]] Again the purpose is to create a bridge from the patient’s practical reasoning to accepting new ideas. Examples are detailed in Table 2. After making a reframing statement, you may notice the patient’s expression change, indicating that they may not fully agree. Or the patient may disagree with your statement. The patient has shared valuable information about the change, possibly indicating that it is more complex. Acknowledge this comment and return to asking open-ended questions to learn more. 

When the patient is receptive to your reframing statement, it is time to provide tailored information.

| Patient condition or issue | Examples | Explanation and rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gingivitis: “Do I need to floss? I brush twice a day like my dentist says.” | “You’re wondering if flossing is really needed, as you are a diligent brusher?” | Reframe the resistance as a question to facilitate sharing of new ideas. |
| Eczema: “I’m worried about the side effects of steroid cream.” | “So, what I hear you saying is that you may consider the cream if you were not concerned about side effects.” | Reframe the response positively and allow the patient to consider the new idea. |
| Athlete’s foot: “I've got rid of it before, but it never sticks.” | “It’s discouraging if it returns. Still, you know how to treat athlete’s foot. It sounds like prevention is the issue now.” | Build confidence by naming past successes.Identify a focused behaviour to change. |
| Blood glucose monitoring: “I’m just not ready to do blood sugar testing.” | “How would your life be better if you were able to bring your blood sugars under control?” Probe to uncover personal benefits such as travelling or lowered stress. | Ask about future benefits to shift the patient’s commitment toward change.Reframe to personable benefits. |
| “My blood sugars are not that bad. I don’t need to test.” |  |  |
| Insomnia: “That’s easier said than done. Eating and worrying happen every night for me.” | “It does sound overwhelming. We could try one small change at a time.” | Build confidence by exploring past success, affirming abilities, exploring options, modelling the behaviour and providing timely information. |


#### 3. Provide tailored information

Finally, provide information (if needed) to address the patient’s issue. It is best to do so in a careful way. Try Elicit-Provide-Elicit (Table 3).​[^[4]] It ensures an individual’s willingness to talk, provides personalized information and gathers individual reactions. Patients will benefit most from information tailored to them based on their prior knowledge, learning needs and health. It is more efficient and effective to provide only information that meets the specific needs of that individual.

| Stage | Examples | Explanation and rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elicit | Ask about willingness to receive some information:“May I share information about diabetes blood tests, and you can let me know if it is helpful?”“Would you be interested in hearing more about options?” | Asking allows the patient to save face and take a role in guiding the conversation. If the individual agrees, they are more likely to listen. If they disagree, it is better to recognize resistance and either address concerns or try at another time. |
| Provide | Avoid “you” statements. Provide neutral expert advice:“Other people find . . .”“What happens to some is . . .” | Relate explanations to individual experiences and understandings. Use analogies and plain language to aid comprehension. |
| Elicit | Ask about beliefs, reactions and feelings:“I am not sure how that news has left you feeling.”“What do you think about taking medicine now?”“What do you make of this?” | Consider if this changed the individual’s practical reasoning. Reactions may indicate an individual is:Ready to change—move to the planning step. Considering the new ideas—use rapport skills to reflect back understanding and explore reaction.Resistant—do not push. Reflect back understanding. Offer another idea or offer to help when the patient is ready. |


#### 4. Plan next steps

The final step is making a plan for behavioural change. Before offering suggestions, ask if the individual has attempted this change or has ideas about the next step. People often know what they need to do and how to do it. When appropriate, support the patient’s self-efficacy by providing encouragement and examples of successful changes.​[^[21]] Make sure you take the time to provide some positive reinforcement, including sincere praise such as “I appreciate your willingness to explore trying the nicotine patch” or “I’m glad you kept the appointment even though you’ve been having a hard time.” Another approach is to provide the individual with several options. Talk through the pros and cons of each as needed to help the individual. If choices are overwhelming, narrow the options by sharing, which may have the most significant impact. Even when you cannot find a plan moving forward, thank the patient for their honesty and leave the door open for more discussion next time. 

#### Handling Resistance

If someone is not ready, you can try again another time. Change is a process. Successfully discussing a potential health behaviour without challenging the patient’s sense of face will leave the door open for future opportunities to discuss change.​[^[22]] A non-judgmental discussion of change will allow patients to consider the pros and cons of behaviour personally. This will start to create the sense of dissonance required for change. Play the long game and ensure that people are willing to talk to you again in the future. As Scales says, “Why wrestle, when you can dance?”​[^[23]]

#### Summary

Patients are making decisions about how they meet their self-care needs daily in response to their own beliefs and experiences with medication and behaviour change. By non-judgmentally starting conversations, building rapport, reframing the patient’s concerns, carefully giving information and making a plan together, you can support a patient in making behavioural changes to improve their health.
