#### Introduction

Advising patients on self-care activities carries great professional responsibility.​[^[1]] Pharmacists must gather patient information and, if needed, perform a physical exam, to accurately identify the problem(s) and severity. Pharmacists must then determine if the patient is a candidate for self-treatment, a minor ailment service (as per jurisdictional scope of practice), or if they should be referred to a primary care provider or emergency services. Adopting a uniform patient-care process that is systematically and consistently applied during patient encounters increases the likelihood that optimal health outcomes are achieved.​[^[2]]

#### Background

 As pharmacy continues to move from a product-centric, paternalistic model to a more patient-centric, clinical decision-making one, the care model must also evolve.​[^[1]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]] The Pharmacists’ Patient Care Process (PPCP)—a contemporary, consistent and comprehensive model created by the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP)—attempts to capture this change, and builds on previous approaches to care. 

The PPCP provides a systematic 5-step approach to the delivery of pharmacists’ patient care that is adaptable to different settings, diverse populations and different acuity levels.​[^[5]] This standardized process helps pharmacists provide consistent services to patients and, more specifically, ensures principles of evidence-based practice are routinely used to *collect**, **assess**, **plan**, **implement** *and* **follow-up* with each patient. The process is supported by 3 inter-related elements: collaboration, communication and documentation. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the PPCP, outlining each step and methods of implementation, with an emphasis on self-care encounters. 

#### PPCP: The Core

The PPCP features a patient-centred core (see Figure 1) with continual collaboration, communication and documentation of care.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines patient-centred care as “providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.”​[^[7]] Many opportunities exist for centring the process around the patient in self-care encounters, such as actively listening to, informing and involving patients in their care.

In the context of self-care, collaboration occurs most often with patients, although other health-care practitioners (HCPs) may be contacted when additional information is needed or when referral is warranted.​[^[1]] Similarly, communication in self-care encounters is most often with patients, rather than HCPs, and requires active listening, empathy and upholding patient privacy (see Effective Pharmacist-patient Interactions). Ideally a self-care encounter begins with the pharmacist asking broad, open-ended questions, followed by focused, open-ended questions to obtain more specific information. Finally closed-ended questions are used to gather key information that may be important to the differential diagnosis or to further clarify information previously obtained.​[^[3]] The pharmacist must carefully listen to and consider the patient’s response, needs, wants, habits, preferences and beliefs to ensure the process remains patient-centred. Professionalism, interview proficiency and interpersonal communication skills are crucial in obtaining effective subjective information.​[^[1]] An informed or shared decision-making model, based on information exchange and mutual expression of preferences between the patient and pharmacist, is desirable when selecting nonprescription medications.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]

Self-care encounters should be documented, as it demonstrates “the pharmacist’s contributions to care, ensures continuity of care, provides legal evidence for professional liability, and contributes to billing and reimbursement needs.”​[^[1]] Documentation may be completed on paper or in a computer system, so long as it is timely and legible, and may include patient-specific factors, care plan details, notes on interventions or referrals, and follow-up information. Where documentation of every self-care encounter is not feasible, pharmacists should use their professional judgment in deciding which encounters are more pertinent to document (e.g., those in which the patient has been referred for further assessment or has many comorbidities).

#### PPCP: The 5 Steps

Self-care encounters in pharmacies typically occur via 1 of 2 paths. In one, a patient or caregiver initiates the interaction by contacting or approaching the pharmacist with a concern. In the other, the pharmacist or pharmacy staff initiates the interaction and offers assistance after observing the patient or caregiver in the nonprescription aisle.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] Reports from various countries indicate that when advice is received, the process is initiated almost exclusively by patients.​[^[12]] Regardless of the path, the pharmacist must build rapport with the patient to facilitate engagement and effective communication and complete the 5 PPCP steps to determine the most appropriate recommendation(s).​[^[13]]

#### Step 1: Collect

To understand the patient’s health status, subjective and objective information must be collected. This may include:



Professional clinical judgment should be exercised when determining which of these factors are pertinent to collect in each specific situation and which (if any) can be omitted.​[^[1]]​[^[13]] For example, asking about the use of public swimming pools may be important in suspected cases of athlete’s foot, but unimportant in the assessment of other ailments such as insomnia. For self-care encounters, most information collected will be subjective data gathered from the patient or caregiver during the interview. There may or may not be a need to collect objective information—unbiased data that can be collected through direct observation and measurement (e.g., laboratory or diagnostic tests); however, it is ultimately the pharmacist’s responsibility to assure that all gathered data is accurate, regardless of the source.​[^[3]]​[^[5]] It may be appropriate to perform physical assessment (mainly inspection and palpation) for certain consults but not for others. For example, plantar warts, athlete’s foot, and minor cuts and burns are easily inspected by a pharmacist. 

#### Step 2: Assess

This step involves analyzing the information gathered in Step 1 in order to identify and prioritize the patient’s problem based on severity and the potential to cause harm, as well as the patient’s desire for care.​[^[15]] Components of this step include:​[^[1]]



For self-care encounters, this step may or may not involve all components listed above, and involves differentiating the patient’s signs/symptoms to correctly identify the problem, its severity, urgency and most probable cause. 

#### Medication Assessment

In contrast to a comprehensive medication review involving evaluation of the patient’s medications for appropriateness, effectiveness, safety and adherence,​[^[6]] a self-care encounter generally requires a more targeted medication review.​[^[1]] For example, a targeted medication review in self-care may include assessing the cause of a patient’s chief complaint as potentially medication-related (e.g., was a patient presenting with vaginal candidiasis recently started on a medication known to increase the risk of this type of infection, such as an SGLT2 inhibitor?).​[^[13]] The pharmacist’s role in these situations is to identify and prioritize medication-related problems and make subsequent modifications to the patient’s medication regimen. While all are possible, the most likely medication-related problem in a self-care encounter is “needs additional drug therapy,” as patients are presenting with the intent to purchase a product to treat a disorder that may require a nonprescription medication for resolution.​[^[1]] It is also essential to consider the risks and potential benefits associated with each medication, including an assessment of whether current self-care therapies are working for the patient in the way they were intended.​[^[13]]

#### Patient History and Risk Assessment

Analysis of key information (e.g., health and functional status, risk factors, health data, cultural factors, health literacy, access to medications or other aspects of care) in this category may significantly influence patient assessment and approach to management. For example, if a patient with human immunodeficiency virus is seeking self-care for recurrent aphthous ulcers, the assessment would not conclude self-treatment appropriate, as the patient requires further medical evaluation and treatment beyond self-care.​[^[13]] 

#### Preventive Care Assessment

For self-care encounters, preventive care assessments are often focused on reducing the risk of recurrence of the presenting chief complaint. For example, if a patient presents with diaper dermatitis, the pharmacist may assess the need to prevent future diaper dermatitis and recommend a preventive plan that includes a barrier product.​[^[1]] Other examples of preventive care include immunizations, self-examinations and screenings. To appropriately assess the need for preventive care, the pharmacist must have an understanding of the requirements or evidence-based guidelines for current recommended preventive-care practices.​[^[15]]

#### Is Self-Treatment Appropriate?

Patient-specific data should be assessed to identify exclusions for self-treatment. It may not be appropriate for an individual to self-treat for several reasons. To establish whether or not the patient is an appropriate self-care candidate, ask if the patient:



A patient meeting any of these 3 criteria is not an appropriate self-care candidate and should be referred for further medical evaluation,​[^[16]]​[^[17]] since most medical conditions that can be safely self-treated are characterized as having no severe symptoms and no symptoms that are persistent or repeatedly return without an identifiable cause. Additionally, patients should not self-treat in an attempt to avoid evaluation and treatment by an HCP.

Additional exclusions for self-treatment include the following:​[^[1]]



It is the responsibility of the pharmacist to be knowledgeable of exclusion criteria for self-treatment and to collect appropriate information that may result in patient referral.​[^[1]]

| Red Flag | Possible Significance of Red Flag |
| --- | --- |
| Change in level of consciousness, change in senses (vision, hearing, taste), seizures, difficulty breathing | Infection, concussion, stroke, hypoglycemia, poisoning, overdose |
| Paralysis of face, arms, legs; difficulty speaking | Transient ischemic attack, stroke |
| Severe headache (“Worst headache I’ve ever had.”) | Cerebral aneurysm, stroke |
| Fever in infants <6 months of age | Infection, meningitis |
| Fever in those >6 months of age for >72 h | Infection |
| Fever, vomiting, headache, confusion, difficulty bending neck | Meningitis |
| Diarrhea or vomiting in high-risk groups, e.g., infants, children, elderly | Risk of dehydration; more intensive investigation may be required |
| Persistent bleeding | Clotting abnormalities |
| Spontaneous bleeding/bruising | Clotting abnormalities |
| Bleeding from any orifice | Internal bleeding |
| Discoloured urine or feces (rule out drug causes) | Internal bleeding |
| Chest pain | Acute coronary syndromes |
| Increasing breathlessness | Pulmonary embolism, heart failure, bronchospasm |
| Partial- or full-thickness burns to the face or mouth | May cause airway obstruction |
| Localized redness, swelling, tenderness, heat; pus | Infection |
| Yellowing of skin and/or eyes | Jaundice, liver damage |


#### Poisoning and Accidental Overdose

Management of the patient who may have been accidentally or intentionally exposed to a poison requires a specific type of assessment and triage. Suggested management is shown in Figure 2. The likelihood of accidental poisoning is highest with children, especially between 1 and 3 years of age.​[^[18]] Common sources of poisoning in children are nonprescription medicines (cough and cold products, analgesics), plants and cleaning agents. Determining the source of the poison, if possible, can be helpful in management.

#### Step 3: Plan

In a self-care encounter, information that has been gathered and analyzed in Steps 1 and 2 will culminate in 1 of 4 general recommendations:​[^[1]] 



If self-care is deemed appropriate, the pharmacist can provide the patient with suitable pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic therapies for prevention and/or treatment. If referring and recommending self-care measures, it is imperative to emphasize that the referral is the primary recommendation and explicitly state the repercussions of ignoring this advice.​[^[1]] For example, a patient presenting with severe dysmenorrhea may be referred for further assessment and/or treatment for alternative diagnoses, but provided with nonpharmacologic measures (e.g., heat therapy) and pharmacologic recommendations (e.g., use of an NSAID) by the pharmacist while waiting to see a physician.

The care plan should be developed in collaboration with other HCPs and the patient or caregiver, and should be individualized, evidence-based, safe, cost-effective and patient-centred. Four key areas the care plan should address include: 



In some countries and jurisdictions, the pharmacist’s care plan may be part of a recognized minor ailments prescribing program, which may include a specified range of treatment options.

##### Medication-Related Problems

For self-care encounters, this usually results in the pharmacist recommending a safe and cost-effective nonprescription product to resolve the “needs additional drug therapy” problem.​[^[1]] To ensure patient-centrality and an individualized approach, it is crucial to involve the patient in the decision-making process for product selection or discontinuation and to tailor therapy to meet the patient’s preferences and beliefs. For example, if possible, consider previous medication experiences and provide the patient with a choice of products, dosage forms and regimens, costs, and flavours. 

##### Goals of Therapy



For self-care encounters, the clinical parameter is likely to focus on resolution of the presenting sign or symptom, such as “alleviate the discomfort associated with primary dysmenorrhea” when an NSAID is recommended. Alternatively, the clinical parameter may be a preventive measure. Establishing the patient’s goals of therapy and educating on realistic time frames for achieving clinical outcomes in the context of the patient’s overall health goals and access to care is imperative and establishes clear expectations. For example, “curing” a cold is not possible, but relief of symptoms is. The complete goal of therapy for a febrile patient receiving antipyretic therapy may be “the patient’s discomfort associated with fever will be completely eliminated within 2 hours.”​[^[1]]

##### Patient Engagement

Every self-care encounter requires the pharmacist to engage the patient through education, empowerment and self-management.​[^[6]] The education should encompass the presenting illness and pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic recommendations as well as when to seek medical attention. Including patients in goal-setting to ensure their expectations align with the pharmacist’s recommendation empowers them and enhances their self-care confidence.

##### Care Continuity

The plan should include the continuity of care, involving follow-up, referral and transition of care to another HCP.

#### Step 4: Implement

This step involves execution of the developed plan, in which the pharmacist: 



The pharmacist should communicate the goals of therapy that were established and the subsequent self-care products that have been selected for the presenting illness on the basis of patient- or therapy-specific variables. The pharmacist should clearly articulate what the treatments are, the rationale for taking them/how they will help, proper use, onset of action, duration of use, and common adverse effects and how to manage them. It is important to advise the patient about what to expect from the treatment and to explain follow-up and monitoring parameters, including what actions to take if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within the expected time frame and when to seek a physician's advice.​[^[13]] Where applicable, the plan should include lifestyle modifications and nonpharmacologic therapies as well as preventative measures to empower patients to self-manage the problem. All of this information, including a detailed explanation of the problem, treatment recommendations and rationale, should be clearly communicated in patient-friendly language to the patient or caregiver. 

#### Step 5: Follow-Up—Monitor and Evaluate

The last PPCP step includes ongoing monitoring and evaluation of: 



It is imperative to evaluate the self-care plan outcomes and adjust the care plan when outcomes are not optimal. From a patient safety perspective, this step should include the documentation and reporting of any adverse drug events to appropriate personnel, followed by appropriate adjustments to therapy to avoid additional adverse outcomes. Changes to care plans should also be documented and communicated to the patient’s entire health-care team to ensure patient safety, effective follow-up and continuity of care. 

Patients should be provided with an appropriate follow-up and monitoring plan, including timing of next consult and triggers that would warrant a pharmacist or physician visit before the scheduled follow-up. Encourage patients to call or return if symptoms worsen or fail to resolve within established timelines. For example, “If your fever does not go away in 72 hours or if your neck becomes stiff, contact your doctor.” While follow-up may not be possible in some self-care encounters due to the patient being unfamiliar to the pharmacy or workload/time restrictions, there are times when follow-up is vital to ensure patient safety. Pharmacists should exercise professional judgment in determining which cases require follow-up. For example, parents seeking a rehydration fluid for their child should be contacted within 24 hours to determine whether the child is displaying signs of dehydration.​[^[1]]

#### Tools & Mnemonics for PPCP Efficiency

A systematic approach to determining patients’ self-care needs will result in consistent and comprehensive patient assessment and lead to optimal therapeutic outcomes.​[^[19]] Several mnemonics have been developed to assist pharmacists in standardizing their approach to information gathering, patient assessment and triage.​[^[16]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]] Examples are presented in Table 2. The SCHOLAR acronym is specific to an individual’s chief complaint and is intended to prompt users to collect this key information. The MAC(S) acronym is intended to prompt users to collect additional pieces of information specific to an individual’s history. If relevant, ask the patient about the possibility that they might be pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Evidence shows that the use of a structured interviewing framework improves user confidence, recommendations and counselling.​[^[16]] Furthermore, patient assessment is more comprehensive and there is less opportunity for error.

#### Summary

Patient assessment is one of the most important skills a pharmacist will use daily in practice. It is essential for identifying drug-related problems, identifying and managing minor ailments, referring patients who require a higher level of care, educating patients about disease and drug therapy, and facilitating more effective communication with other HCPs.​[^[3]]
