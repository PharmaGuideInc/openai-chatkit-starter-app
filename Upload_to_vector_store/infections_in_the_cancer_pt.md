#### Introduction

Infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients despite progress in their recognition, therapy and prevention. The ever-expanding armamentarium of antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy and immunotherapy has improved survival rates in cancer patients, but simultaneously has rendered them more susceptible to infections because of prolonged immune dysfunction.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Environmental precautions are important to prevent infection in cancer patients.



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Antimicrobials (antibacterials, antifungals and antivirals) used to treat infections in cancer patients are presented in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3.

#### Antibacterial Therapy



#### Antifungal Therapy



**Candida**



**Aspergillus**



#### Antiviral Therapy



#### Supportive Care Measures



#### Prevention of Infection in Cancer Patients



#### Vaccination of Cancer Patients



#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Algorithms

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to guide the management of patients with fever and potential infection, particularly in the context of cancer and chemotherapy. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

### Initial Condition
- **Temperature Criteria**: 
  - ≥38.3°C for one reading or ≥38°C for ≥1 hour.

### History
- **Type of Cancer (Immunologic Defect; Tumor-Related Obstruction or Dysfunction) – Likely Pathogen**:
  - **Neutrophil Dysfunction**: 
    - Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida spp.
  - **B Cell Dysfunction**: 
    - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae.
  - **T Cell Dysfunction**: 
    - Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium spp., Legionella spp., Cryptococcus spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, RSV.
  - **CNS Dysfunction**: 
    - Anaerobes, Enterobacterales.
  - **Obstruction**:
    - **GI**: Enterobacterales + anaerobes.
    - **GU**: Enterobacterales.
    - **Lung**: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacterales.

- **Iatrogenic Procedures**:
  - Surgery – skin flora, Enterobacterales.

- **Chemotherapy Administration and Timing**:
  - Effect on immunological function.
  - Effect on mucous membranes.

### Physical Examination
- **Site of Possible Infection – Likely Pathogen**:
  - **Skin**: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, diphtheroids, Enterobacterales.
  - **Lung**: S. pneumoniae, Enterobacterales, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Legionella spp., influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV.
  - **Bowel**: Anaerobes + aerobic gram-negative bacilli.

### Investigations
- **Tests**: CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, chest x-ray.

### Decision Points
- **Nonneutropenic**:
  - **Focus of Infection Located**:
    - Appropriate antibiotic therapy (see Table 1).
  - **Focus of Infection Unknown**:
    - Clinically stable: Await investigations and observe.
    - Clinically unstable: Combination therapy with cefazolin + aminoglycoside.

- **Neutropenic** (see Figure 2):
  - **Focus of Infection Located**:
    - Appropriate antibiotic therapy (see Table 1).
  - **Focus of Infection Unknown**:
    - Clinically stable: Await investigations and observe.
    - Clinically unstable: Monotherapy with ceftriaxone, or imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing infections in patients with cancer, considering their immunological status and potential sites of infection.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing febrile neutropenic patients. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Start Point:**
   - Febrile neutropenic patient.

2. **Initial Step:**
   - Evaluate: laboratory investigations.

3. **Risk Assessment for Outpatient Therapy:**
   - Considerations:
     - Duration of neutropenia ≥ 7 days?
     - Concurrent comorbid conditions?
     - Serious medical complications?
     - Uncontrolled cancer?

4. **Decision Point:**
   - If any risk factors are present, proceed to inpatient therapy.
   - If no risk factors, proceed to outpatient therapy.

5. **Inpatient Therapy:**
   - Determine if vancomycin is needed for mucositis, venous access infection, or colonization with MRSA. Consult an infectious disease specialist.
   - If yes, use:
     - IV vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, or cefepime; or
     - IV vancomycin + imipenem or meropenem.
   - If no, choose one of the following regimens and re-evaluate at 72 hours:
     - IV antipseudomonal combination therapy (a,b).
     - IV monotherapy (c).

6. **Risk Stratification:**
   - High risk: neutrophils < 0.5 x 10^9/L.
   - Low risk: neutrophils ≥ 0.5 x 10^9/L.
   - Not neutropenic: treat microbiologically or clinically documented infections for 10–14 days.

7. **High Risk Management:**
   - If not febrile, consider stopping aminoglycoside if no resistant gram-negative bacilli found and continue other antibiotics until neutrophils > 0.5 x 10^9/L and afebrile for ≥ 48 hours.
   - If febrile, add vancomycin and/or broaden antibiotic coverage.
   - Reassess febrility:
     - If not febrile, consider stopping antimicrobials if afebrile and stable ≥ 72 hours.
     - If febrile, after 4 days, re-investigate and add IV antifungal therapy (amphotericin B compound, caspofungin, or voriconazole) until neutrophils > 0.5 x 10^9/L and afebrile for ≥ 48 hours or until resolution of the fungal infection.

8. **Low Risk Management:**
   - If not febrile, consider switching to PO amoxicillin/clavulanate + fluoroquinolone or stop all antimicrobial therapy if stable and afebrile > 72 hours.
   - If febrile, modify regimen.

9. **Outpatient Therapy:**
   - Preferred: PO amoxicillin/clavulanate + PO ciprofloxacin.
   - Alternatives:
     - IV/PO clindamycin + PO ciprofloxacin or
     - IV piperacillin/tazobactam.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing febrile neutropenic patients, considering risk factors, and guiding therapy choices based on risk stratification and response to treatment.
