#### Pathophysiology

A wound is a disruption in the normal skin structure and functioning due to mechanical trauma and injury. Wounds can range from minor breaks in the epidermal layer of the skin to deeper injuries that involve the subcutaneous tissue, tendons, muscles, vessels, nerves and bone. 

Wounds are classified as acute or chronic:



Wound healing occurs either through regeneration or repair of the skin. Regeneration is the replacement of injured tissue with identical cells that are capable of regeneration such as epithelial cells. Repair occurs more commonly and is the process whereby injured tissue is replaced with connective tissue, which forms a scar. Wound healing begins at the time of injury and generally proceeds through 4 phases:​[^[2]]​[^[3]]



#### Wound Complications

The most common complications of acute wounds are infection and scarring.

#### Infection

All wounds are contaminated with bacteria to some extent, and infection is possible if the wound is not treated appropriately and promptly. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and fungi may be involved in wound infections. Infection with Clostridium tetani (found in soil) via a contaminated wound can be fatal. Patients with wounds that are dirty should be given a **tetanus vaccination** to prevent infection with this bacterium if their vaccination status is not adequate or unknown​[^[5]] (see Pharmacologic Therapy).

Minor infection presents with inflammation, tenderness to touch and warmth in the immediate area of the wound. It is important not to rely on changes in skin colour as a key indicator of infection as it may not be visible, particularly in darkly pigmented skin.​[^[6]] Other symptoms of wound infection may appear as discharge, delayed healing, abnormal odour, wound breakdown and increased pain.​[^[7]] These symptoms may indicate a more serious infection.

Wound factors that may increase the risk of infection include:​[^[7]]​[^[8]]



Patient factors that may affect wound healing and thereby increase risk of infection include:​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[10]]



#### Scarring

Scarring is a natural part of the healing process and occurs when there is a large deposit of collagen at the wound site. The most effective way to minimize scarring is to limit skin damage by treating wounds early and effectively.​[^[6]] Moist healing environments have been shown to decrease the extent of scarring and improve the healing of wounds by accelerating inflammatory and proliferative phases of repair.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

Scar tissue may be slightly raised and hyperpigmented, which improves as the skin continues to heal years after the injury.​[^[13]] Keloid scars are enlarged, raised scars that may spread beyond the original wound area. They may be itchy and painful and are difficult to treat. Keloid scars are more prevalent in darkly pigmented skin for unclear reasons.​[^[6]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The initial assessment of a wound determines if it can be self-treated or requires referral for further treatment. Superficial wounds that are small and accompanied by limited bleeding are suitable for self-management. See Burns for information specific to burn wounds.



#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Self-treatment of minor wounds includes the following steps:



**Débridement:** The removal of dead or contaminated tissue from the wound should be performed only by an appropriately trained health-care practitioner and under sterile conditions.​[^[4]]​[^[7]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

#### Cleansing and Antiseptic Agents

Use of antiseptics is appropriate only when the risk of infection is high (see Wound Complications). See Table 1.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: First Aid.

| Treatment | Uses | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saline solution | Cleansing agent for the initial removal of dirt and debris from a wound. | Not harmful to tissue. | Not always available; there is no evidence that saline is more effective than tap water for preventing infections in wounds.​[15] |
| Hydrogen peroxide 3% | Oxidizing agent that has antiseptic, disinfectant and deodorant properties used to clean wounds. | Effervescent action cleanses wounds.Has some mild antibacterial activity. | May cause tissue toxicity and impair wound healing through irritation of the tissue and destruction of regenerating epithelium.Has limited bactericidal effect.Little benefit over soapy water.Burning and stinging on application. |
| **** | Bactericidal in concentrations of 70–90% and used as a disinfectant for wounds and prior to injections. | Can decrease bacteria counts for 20–40 min after contact.Some fungicidal activity. | Not to be used on open wounds.High potential for drying the skin.Irritating to tissue.Burning and stinging on application. |
| Iodine | Used as a disinfectant and antiseptic for contaminated wounds, wound bed management and prevention of infection. | Aqueous solution is preferable as it is less irritating and drying than alcohol base. | Contraindicated in patients with iodine allergy.May be absorbed systemically; can be harmful if used on large areas or for prolonged periods of time. Use with caution in patients with thyroid disorder, children, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Stains skin and clothing.May irritate tissue and impair wound healing.May cause allergic sensitization.Burning and stinging on application. |
| Povidone-iodine | Used as a disinfectant and antiseptic for contaminated or infected wounds and for pre-operative preparation of the skin. | Nonirritating to skin.Rapid bactericidal activity.Broad-spectrum. | Contraindicated in patients with iodine allergy.May be absorbed systemically; can be harmful if used on large areas or for prolonged periods of time. Use with caution in patients with thyroid disorder, children, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Infection and tissue damage increased if used in combination with surfactants.May delay wound healing. |


#### Antibiotic Treatment

#### Topical Antibiotics

#### Prevention

Prophylaxis of infection: Risk of infection can be decreased by proper cleansing and covering of acute wounds and the use of antiseptics in wounds at higher risk (see Infection and Cleansing and Antiseptic Agents). **Topical antibiotics** are not recommended for prevention of infection in minor cuts and wounds. There is a risk of local allergic reactions and emergence of resistant organisms with the use of topical antibiotics. Studies (in postsurgical wounds) have shown only small absolute risk reduction for infection prevention with topical antibiotics compared to placebo.​[^[20]]

#### Treatment

Treatment of infection: Consider use of **topical antibiotics** in acute wounds only when specific signs of infection are present (see Infection), keeping in mind responsible antibiotic stewardship.​[^[21]] Superficial, mildly infected acute wounds may be treated with topical antibiotics such as **fusidic acid**, and **mupirocin**.​[^[19]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Various combinations of **bacitracin/gramicidin/polymyxin B/neomycin** are widely marketed for superficial wound infections but are potential sensitizers; their widespread use increases the risk of the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.​[^[21]] There is insufficient evidence to recommend one topical antibiotic over another except in the case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection where mupirocin is recommended.​[^[24]] If topical antibiotics are used, discontinue as soon as signs and symptoms of infection are no longer present. Consider further assessment and/or treatment if clinical improvement is not evident despite topical antibiotic therapy or if signs and symptoms of infection worsen at any time.

More information on topical antibacterials can be found in Table 3

#### Systemic Antibiotics

###### Prevention

Further assessment for prevention of infection in an acute wound with **oral antibiotics** is recommended in cases of animal or human bites, deep puncture wounds, and wounds involving the palms and fingers.​[^[22]]

###### Treatment

Treatment of an infection in an acute wound with **oral antibiotics** is recommended for confirmed infections involving deeper tissues (including puncture and bite wounds)​[^[22]] and may also be considered if there are systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, chills), or if a superficial or mild infection does not improve or worsens despite appropriate wound care and/or has not responded to topical antibiotic therapy. For further information on use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial skin infections, consult *CPS: Therapeutic Choices*: Bacterial Skin Infections.

#### Other Therapy

#### Honey

Various types and formulations of topical **honey** have been shown to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.​[^[25]] Systematic reviews have found that topical honey interventions improved rate of healing in some types of burn wounds​[^[26]] and resulted in better aesthetic results and lower wound complication rates compared to conventional dressings in acute surgical incisions​[^[27]] but evidence is limited and more study is required.

#### Aloe Vera

Systematic reviews have determined that evidence is inconclusive regarding whether **aloe vera** gel improves outcomes for acute wounds.​[^[28]] Some patients experience mild side effects of burning sensation, contact dermatitis or mild itching with topical application of aloe vera.​[^[29]] 

#### Tetanus Immunization

Tetanus is a potential complication of any wound in those whose tetanus immunization is incomplete or has lapsed.​[^[5]]​[^[22]] Even patients with apparently minor, clean wounds should receive a **tetanus booster** if their immunization is incomplete (less than 3 doses), they are uncertain when they received their last tetanus shot or their last tetanus shot was more than 10 years ago. Patients with dirty or complicated wounds require tetanus prophylaxis if more than 5 years have elapsed since their last tetanus booster.​[^[5]] Consider **rabies vaccination** in cases of bites from unprovoked animal attacks, especially where wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, foxes or bats are involved.​[^[3]]

#### Scar Treatments

Use of sunscreen on the affected area after a wound injury heals may help prevent the discoloration of scars due to sun exposure. Topically applied **silicone gels** and **sheets**, which hydrate the affected area, have been used in efforts to prevent scarring of newly healed wounds and to minimize the appearance of existing scars. A systematic review concluded that it is uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared to no treatment or most other treatments as studies were small and unreliable.​[^[12]]​[^[30]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

A monitoring plan for patients with minor cuts and wounds is provided in Table 2.

| Sign/Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bleeding | Monitor bleeding: should stop within 10 min (15 min if on anticoagulants). | Bleeding significantly slows or stops within 10–15 min of direct pressure. | Patient requires emergency medical treatment if blood is spurting or significant bleeding persists after 10 min of direct pressure (15 min if on anticoagulants). |
| Infection, e.g., swelling, inflammation that is tender to touch, red or dark streaks (depending on normal skin colour) from the wound, pus or fever | Monitor daily at dressing change for at least 48 h. | No signs or symptoms of infection present at 48 h. | Assess for further treatment if signs and symptoms of infection are present at or before 48 h. |
| Wound healing | Monitor daily at dressing change for 4–14 days (depending on wound type, depth and location). | Normally, healing wounds appear pink or red with tiny opalescent islands of epithelium throughout and no drainage. | If wound continues to weep, remains raw and red, or does not appear to be closing within 3 wk, further assessment is required. |
