#### Introduction

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) includes all tachyarrhythmias arising from above the ventricles. It usually has a narrow QRS width (≤120 ms). Occasionally the QRS complex during tachycardia is broad because there is coexistent bundle branch block. In this situation, the initial step is to exclude ventricular tachycardia, after which a differential diagnosis of SVT is performed (see Figure 1).

The classification of common forms of SVT is shown in Table 1.

| Arrhythmia | Clinical Significance of Arrhythmia |
| --- | --- |
| Atrial fibrillation | Significant because of thromboembolic risk |
| Atrial flutter | Probably similar thromboembolic risk to atrial fibrillation |
| Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) | Usually benign |
| Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT) | Usually benign; risk of sudden death if AVRT degenerates into pre-excited SVT (rare) |
| Atrial tachycardia (AT) | Usually benign unless it persists for prolonged period (rare) |


The terms “paroxysmal,” “persistent,” “long-standing persistent” and “permanent” are now used to classify atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter; the older term “chronic atrial fibrillation” is obsolete (see Table 2).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Paroxysmal | Recurrent self-limiting episodes (lasting less than 7 days) |
| Persistent | Continuous arrhythmia lasting >7 days and <12 months |
| Long-standing persistent | Continuous arrhythmia lasting >12 months; maintenance of sinus rhythm is an achievable goal |
| Permanent | The patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, since maintenance of sinus rhythm is no longer achievable or desirable |


Management of AF and atrial flutter is similar. The risk of thromboembolic complications should be assessed in both situations. Many patients have a combination of both arrhythmias, but there are some important differences in the management of the two. Firstly, it is often more difficult to achieve heart rate control in patients with atrial flutter than AF. Secondly, the threshold for using catheter ablation is lower for atrial flutter than for AF.

An algorithm to guide the management of symptomatic AF or atrial flutter is provided in Figure 2.

The heart is usually structurally normal in patients with atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) and focal atrial tachycardia (AT). AVRT is due to a congenital accessory bypass tract between the atria and ventricles. The circuit usually follows an antegrade limb through the atrioventricular (AV) node and a retrograde limb through the accessory pathway, although the opposite occasionally occurs. If the accessory pathway is capable of antegrade conduction during sinus rhythm, it usually manifests on the resting ECG as a delta wave and is known as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. AVNRT involves a localized short circuit within the AV node. Focal AT arises from a localized area of atrial myocardium that is capable of accelerated automatic firing.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Cardioversion

Electrical cardioversion is the process of delivering electrical energy to the heart to restore sinus rhythm. External defibrillators can be categorized as monophasic or biphasic energy delivery systems depending on polarity and electron flow during shock. Biphasic energy delivery has the advantage of lower energy requirement for cardioversion. A synchronized shock on the R wave is used, and there is no evidence that any paddle position is more effective than another. It is normal to start with the anterior-apex position, and if this is unsuccessful, then another position, usually antero-posterior, is tried. In general, any tachycardia that produces hemodynamic compromise, heart failure, or angina and is resistant to prompt medical management should be terminated electrically. Most supraventricular arrhythmias, with the exception of atrial flutter and fibrillation, are usually responsive to medical therapy and hence cardioversion is seldom necessary. Furthermore, cardioversion can be a useful adjunctive measure in patients with persistent AF or atrial flutter. 

 The initial success rate of cardioversion for AF is 70–90%, but only about 20% of patients will remain in sinus rhythm at 12-month follow-up. Using additional antiarrhythmic therapy can improve maintenance of sinus rhythm. For example, 50–65% of patients treated with amiodarone are still in sinus rhythm at 12 months. Direct current cardioversion has a low incidence of side effects. Arrhythmias induced by the cardioversion are generally caused by inadequate synchronization.

The duration of AF or atrial flutter should be clearly determined before proceeding with cardioversion. Importantly, all patients with AF or atrial flutter lasting ≥48 hours, those with a CHADS score ≥2 (see Table 3) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or atrial flutter ≥12 hours, and those with TIA or stroke in previous 6 months should be anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks prior to electrical cardioversion. Alternatively, anticoagulation can be initiated and a transesophageal echocardiogram performed to rule out the presence of left atrial thrombus. This strategy can expedite electrical cardioversion for patients requiring urgent rhythm control. Adequate anticoagulation should be maintained for a minimum of 4 weeks after cardioversion, regardless of the duration of anticoagulant therapy prior to cardioversion.​[^[1]] The need for long-term anticoagulation is determined by the presence of risk factors for systemic embolism (see Figure 3). 

#### Catheter Ablation

Catheter ablation is the precise application of radiofrequency or cryothermal energy, strategically targeting specific areas within the heart to induce tissue injury and thereby prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Pulse field ablation is a system under development to produce nonthermal lesions in cardiac tissue through irreversible electroporation and cell membrane disruption. Pulse field ablation may provide a novel therapeutic option and reduce traditional potential complications associated with radiofrequency and cryothermal injury such as esophageal injury or phrenic nerve injury.

In patients with re-entrant tachycardias (AVNRT or AVRT) or focal atrial tachycardia, the reported cure rates after catheter ablation range from 90–98%. The associated risk is much lower than the risk with catheter ablation for AF. Hence, the threshold for nonpharmacologic management of these arrhythmias is low. Catheter ablation is strongly recommended for patients with WPW and rapidly conducted pre-excited SVT. Catheter ablation should be considered as a first-line treatment option in patients with recurrent symptomatic AVRT, AVNRT or focal atrial tachycardia. Catheter ablation is also an option for patients with occasional episodes of AVNRT who desire complete rhythm control and for patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation. The success rate for catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter is usually about 95% with a low rate of complications; hence, ablation should be considered as first-line treatment for most patients with typical atrial flutter. Suitable patients can usually be rate controlled while awaiting elective ablation. If patients cannot be rate controlled, expedited ablation or electrical cardioversion are reasonable options.

Catheter ablation for AF is a recommended option for patients who are symptomatic and have failed or do not wish to remain on an antiarrhythmic drug long term.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Ablation is often not a complete cure for AF but can significantly reduce the arrhythmia burden. Success rates vary from 50–80% depending on technique, AF subtype and the extent of structural heart disease. Patients with paroxysmal AF have the highest success rate. In contrast, patients with long-standing persistent AF lasting >3–5 years have much lower success rates. There is mounting evidence that early intervention with ablation will prevent progression from paroxysmal to persistent atrial fibrillation.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] The technique involves ablation of the left atrium, primarily focusing on the areas around the pulmonary veins. The success of ablation seems to relate to electrical disconnection of AF triggers arising from the pulmonary veins and/or modification of the arrhythmogenic left atrial substrate. Procedural complications specifically related to AF ablation include a 2% risk of vascular access complications, a 1% risk of tamponade, a 0.25% risk of stroke and a 0.15% risk of death, usually due to atrial esophageal fistula. The fistula can develop insidiously 2–6 weeks post-procedure. Clinical features may include any or all of the following: fever, chest pain, stroke, decreased level of consciousness, upper abdominal pain, odynophagia, vomiting or GI bleeding. The use of PPIs may reduce the risk of GI bleed and is suggested after catheter ablation for AF.  

#### Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion

Some patients who would benefit from the use of an oral anticoagulant are not candidates because of a very high risk of hemorrhage. The optimal strategy to reduce the risk of stroke in these subjects is unclear. Among patients with nonvalvular AF, the vast majority of thrombi are located within or involve the left atrial appendage (LAA). This provides the rationale for the strategy of left atrial appendage amputation or occlusion to reduce the risk of systemic embolism.

Percutaneous LAA occlusion may be considered in the rare patient with AF at high risk of stroke who is not a candidate for antithrombotic therapy. Conditions where prolonged anticoagulation is contraindicated should be recurrent and irreversible. Examples include recurrent irreversible intracranial bleeding, GI bleed, retroperitoneal bleed, esophageal varices, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), intraocular bleed, irreversible pulmonary bleed and urogenital bleed. The current Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines give a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence for use of LAA closure devices.​[^[1]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Long-Term Management of Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

This first decision is whether to choose rate control (leaving atrial arrhythmia as the permanent rhythm) or to actively pursue sinus rhythm (rhythm control). The AFFIRM trial compared these 2 treatment strategies in 4060 patients and found no difference in stroke or death rates between the 2 groups.​[^[6]] However, patients in the AFFIRM trial were older (mean age 69.7) and were either asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms. Therefore, rhythm control should be actively pursued in patients with more than minimal symptoms, in asymptomatic young patients and in those with possible tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Data suggest that this latter diagnosis is a more frequent problem than previously thought.​[^[7]] In addition, the CCS guidelines recommend rhythm control in patients with recently diagnosed (<1 y) atrial fibrillation because of improved stroke and mortality outcomes.​[^[1]]

An overview of the rhythm control management of patients with AF is provided in Figure 4. Selection of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is determined by coexisting structural heart disease. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone for the prevention of recurrences of AF as shown by the Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation (CTAF),​[^[8]] but side effects may require stopping the drug in up to 18% of patients. In approximately 25% of patients, a transient rise in serum aminotransferase concentrations may occur after amiodarone is initiated. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but the drug should be discontinued if there is more than a 2-fold elevation.​[^[9]] Symptomatic hepatitis occurs in less than 3% of patients. It is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored at baseline and every 6 months. Thyroid function tests should also be monitored at baseline and every 6 months due to the risk of hypothyroidism (5–20%) and hyperthyroidism (2–3%). Abnormal thyroid function tests warrant evaluation by an endocrinologist but usually do not require discontinuation of the drug. 

Dronedarone was associated with a 24% relative risk reduction in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization or death.​[^[10]] However, dronedarone is not as efficacious as class IC agents or amiodarone in preventing AF recurrences.

Breakthrough episodes of AF can be terminated by either electrical or chemical cardioversion. Options for chemical cardioversion include oral flecainide or propafenone, IV amiodarone, ibutilide, vernakalant or procainamide (see Table 5). Vernakalant, an atrially selective antiarrhythmic, is reported to provide 50% conversion within 10 minutes of administration.​[^[11]] The CCS guidelines recommend catheter ablation when a rhythm-control strategy is desired but the patient remains symptomatic following adequate trials of antiarrhythmic drug therapy.​[^[1]]

#### Heart Rate Control in Patients with Persistent or Permanent Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

With the exception of some patients with intrinsic AV nodal disease (usually older individuals), most patients will need drugs to achieve rate control. Either a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) (see Table 6) is recommended for initial control of heart rate in patients with normal left ventricular function.​[^[1]] Digoxin should be considered only when response to first-line agents is inadequate or in cases where significant LV dysfunction is suspected.​[^[1]] Because of its potential toxicity, amiodarone should be avoided as a rate control agent for long-term use. Trials are ongoing with etripamil, an investigational calcium channel blocker administered intranasally.

The medication dose should be titrated to achieve a resting heart rate of ≤100 bpm on a 12 lead ECG or on 24-hour Holter monitoring.​[^[12]] Finally, if rate control cannot be achieved with medication, consider AV nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation.

#### Anticoagulation for Paroxysmal, Persistent, and Permanent Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

Use of an oral anticoagulant is recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke in patients who have atrial flutter or fibrillation and are at high risk for stroke.​[^[1]] Estimate stroke risk using the CHADS2 tool outlined in Table 3.​[^[13]] The estimated annual risk of stroke in a patient with a CHADS2 score of 0 who is not receiving an antithrombotic is 1.9%.​[^[13]] In the absence of antithrombotic therapy, the risk of stroke increases by a factor of about 1.5 for each 1-unit increase in CHADS2 score in patients with AF. In patients with a CHADS2 score of 0, additional risk factors (woman/person assigned female at birth, >65 y and diagnosis of vascular disease) that are part of the CHADS-VASc score​[^[14]] can further define risk. The recommendations of the CCS for choosing an antithrombotic agent for stroke prevention are summarized in Figure 3.

| Acronym | CHADS2 Risk Criteria | Assigned Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C | Congestive heart failure | 1 |
| H | Hypertension | 1 |
| A | Age >75 years | 1 |
| D | Diabetes mellitus | 1 |
| S | Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack | 2 |


Warfarin and ASA have been used for many years in this population, although ASA is less effective than warfarin. Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are approved for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with AF. Approval of dabigatran was based largely on the RE-LY study, which randomized patients to warfarin or dabigatran.​[^[15]] Dabigatran 150 mg twice a day was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism. Rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin in the ROCKET-AF trial and was found noninferior to warfarin.​[^[16]] When compared to warfarin in the ENGAGE TIMI 48 trial, edoxaban was shown to be noninferior.​[^[17]] Apixaban was shown to be superior to ASA in the AVERROES study​[^[18]] and to warfarin in the ARISTOTLE study.​[^[19]] The CCS guidelines suggest that when an oral anticoagulant is indicated, treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is preferred over warfarin.​[^[1]] The preference for one of the DOACs over warfarin is less marked among patients already receiving warfarin with stable INRs and no bleeding complications. Other factors (e.g., age, cost, renal function) may also influence drug choice. Clinicians should consider and, if possible, modify factors influencing bleeding risk during oral anticoagulant therapy (hypertension, antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs, excessive alcohol intake). Lower doses of DOACs should be used only in specific patients (see Table 7) to minimize prescribing of inappropriate doses shown to be less effective in preventing stroke.​[^[20]]

The summary of recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF or atrial flutter and coronary artery disease is shown in Figure 5.

Left atrial appendage occlusion might be considered for some patients who are not candidates for oral anticoagulants (see Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion).

#### Management of Re-entrant Tachycardias and Focal Atrial Tachycardia

There have been no large randomized controlled trials in patients with re-entry tachycardias or focal AT. An overview of the acute management of patients with AVRT, AVNRT and AT is illustrated in Figure 6. Observation without further treatment may be appropriate in certain asymptomatic patients who have low arrhythmia burden and no evidence of structural heart disease. Catheter ablation is considered first-line therapy for patients with recurrent symptomatic AVRT, AVNRT or focal AT, according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.​[^[21]] Indications for chronic pharmacologic therapy are presented in Table 4.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart titled "Approach to Rate and Rhythm Management of AF" (Atrial Fibrillation). It outlines the decision-making process for managing paroxysmal and persistent AF.

### Paroxysmal AF:
1. **Low Recurrence Burden:**
   - **Observation**
   - **Pill-in-pocket AAD therapy**

2. **High Recurrence Burden:**
   - **Maintenance AAD therapy**
   - **Catheter ablation** (linked from Pill-in-pocket AAD therapy)

### Persistent AF:
- **Initiate rate control and consider long-term treatment**

### Rhythm Control Preferred With:
- Recently diagnosed AF (within 1 year)
- Highly symptomatic or significant QOL (Quality of Life) impairment
- Multiple recurrences
- Difficulty to achieve rate control
- Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy

### Persistent AF Management:
1. **Optimize Rate Control:**
   - **Symptoms Persist:**
     - **Cardioversion**
       - If symptoms improve with sinus rhythm restoration, continue treatment.
       - If symptoms do not improve despite sinus rhythm, continue long-term rate control.
   - **Symptoms Resolve:**
     - Continue long-term rate control.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing AF based on recurrence burden and symptomatology, guiding treatment options such as observation, medication, cardioversion, and catheter ablation.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **procainamide** (generics) | 15–17 mg/kg over 30 min IV | Hypotension, torsades de pointes. | Risk of arrhythmias with drugs that also prolong the QTc interval, e.g., erythromycin, phenothiazines. | For chemical cardioversion. |
| **flecainide** (generics) | 50 mg Q12H POTitration: increase by 50 mg increments based on QRS intervals; reduce dose if QRS increases >20% from baselineMaximum: 200 mg Q12H PO Renal dysfunction: reduce initial dose by 50%Cardioversion/pill-in-the-pocket:Patients ≥70 kg: 300 mg × 1 POPatients <70 kg: 200 mg × 1 PO | Blurred vision, tremor, HF, VT proarrhythmia. | Metabolized by CYP2D6 (many potential interactions, e.g., celecoxib, desipramine, risperidone). | In patients with AF and/or atrial flutter, a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker should always be coprescribed with a Class IC agent. Not to be used in patients with coronary artery disease or structural heart disease. |
| **propafenone** (Rythmol, generics) | 150 mg Q8H POReduce dose if QRS prolonged >20% from baselineMaximum: 300 mg Q8H PO Renal/hepatic dysfunction: reduce initial dose by 50% and increase dosing interval to Q12HCardioversion/pill-in-the-pocket:Patients ≥70 kg: 600 mg × 1 POPatients <70 kg: 450 mg × 1 PO | Constipation, headache, metallic taste, VT proarrhythmia. | Reduce digoxin dose by 25–50%.Metabolized by CYP2D6 (many potential interactions, e.g., celecoxib, desipramine, risperidone). | Wide variation in patient response possible. Monitor QRS duration carefully.In patients with AF and/or atrial flutter, a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker should always be coprescribed with a Class IC agent.

| **amiodarone** (generics) | Usually 200 mg TID PO × 2 wk then 200 mg daily PO when treating atrial arrhythmiasIntravenous loading: 150 mg IV over 10 min followed by IV infusion of 900 mg/day to a total of 10 gLoading doses may vary | Various gastrointestinal, dermatologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic and thyroid abnormalities. Pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic dysfunction and aggravation of arrhythmias are rare but potentially life-threatening. | Reduce doses of beta-blockers, digoxin, procainamide, quinidine and warfarin by 50%. | Monitor transaminases and thyroid function Q6 months, CXR annually. |
| **dronedarone** (Multaq) | 400 mg BID PO | Diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, hepatic dysfunction (rare).Slight increase in plasma creatinine related to inhibition of secretion; no change in GFR. | Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, e.g., diltiazem, simvastatin.

| **ibutilide** (Corvert) | Patients ≥60 kg: 1 mg × 1 IV over 10 minPatients <60 kg: 0.01 mg/kg × 1 IV over 10 min; may repeat dose once after 10 min | Hypotension, torsades de pointes. | Risk of arrhythmias with drugs that also prolong the QT interval, e.g., erythromycin, phenothiazines. | For chemical cardioversion.Correct any hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to administering ibutilide. |
| **sotalol** (generics) | 80 mg Q12H POTitration: increase by 80 mg increments if QTc <460 ms; reduce dose if QTc ≥500 msMaximum: 240 mg Q12H POOlder patients: reduce initial dose to 40 mg Q12H PORenal dysfunction: reduce initial dose in renal failure | Hypotension, bradycardia, wheezing, VT proarrhythmia.Torsades de pointes, especially at higher doses or with renal dysfunction. | Digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, other beta-blockers; may cause AV block, bradycardia. | Since sotalol is a beta-blocker, use with great caution in view of the risk of QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes. |
| **vernakalant** (Brinavess) | Initial dose: 3 mg/kg (max 339 mg) IV over 10 minMay give second dose if no response 15 mins after first dose completedSecond dose: 2 mg/kg (max 226 mg) IV over 10 min | Atrial flutter, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia.Dysgeusia, hypotension, sneezing. | Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. Class III or IC antiarrhythmic drugs. | For chemical cardioversion.Correct any hypokalemia prior to administering vernakalant. |
