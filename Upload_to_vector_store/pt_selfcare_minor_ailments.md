#### Introduction

Self-care plays a prominent role in the efficient and effective functioning of the overall health-care system, as it is essential for reactive and preventive care. Growing evidence that self-care leads to improved patient outcomes and decreased health-care costs contributes to the expansion of self-care worldwide. In many countries, self-care is being promoted as part of a greater public policy agenda seeking to divert patients from the formal health-care system in an effort to save resources while maintaining acceptable levels of care. As one of the most trusted and accessible health-care professionals (HCPs), pharmacists continue to be a preferred source for accurate and timely self-care information.

#### Self-Care

There is no single definition of self-care that is universally accepted in the literature, as definitions vary depending on the setting in which the term is used and stakeholders’ perspectives.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] The World Self-Medication Industry defines self-care as *a lifelong habit and culture. It is the action individuals take for themselves and their families to stay healthy and take care of minor and long term conditions, based on their knowledge and the information available, and working in collaboration with health and social care professionals where necessary*.​[^[4]] Other definitions have been offered by different health professions, governments, and industry,​[^[1]]​[^[3]]​[^[5]] and vary as to who engages in self-care behaviour, what motivates self-care behaviours, and the extent to which HCPs are involved.​[^[1]] The diversity of self-care definitions has evolved and become expansive over 4 decades, illustrating the growing recognition of the multidimensionality and value of self-care.​[^[1]]

All health-related activity can be described on a continuum, from 100% self-care, e.g., brushing one's teeth, to 100% professional care, e.g., neurosurgery (see Figure 1).​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Self-care represents the actions taken by individuals for their own well-being and involves healthy choices, avoidance of risk factors, recognition of one's symptoms and aspects of self-management. Increased involvement by others is required as individuals progress along the continuum.​[^[8]] There is also growing recognition that patient and caregiver engagement, understanding and support are essential across the entire continuum, as they are associated with patient health and well-being as well as health system efficiency, quality and overall performance.​[^[9]]

#### The 7 Pillars

The International Self-Care Foundation provides an evidence-based registry of effective self-care practices. They are grouped into 7 domains (or pillars) of self-care activities and specific behaviours (see Figure 2).​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

 It is known that unhealthy behaviours, e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet and insufficient exercise, tend to occur together in individuals and particular segments of the population. Interestingly, healthy behaviours in the 7 pillars also occur together. This implies that if a person is motivated toward 1 self-care aspect, e.g., smoking cessation, he or she may also be more likely to assume other healthy behaviours, e.g., losing weight.​[^[10]] Developing a personalized self-care index has been suggested. This would address any potential deficits in self-care with an action plan, including identifying domains where guidance (perhaps from a pharmacist) is warranted.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Clinicians can use this approach to better understand patients’ self-care practices and to tailor specific interventions aimed at improving 1 or more of the domains.

#### Minor Ailments

Minor ailments (also known as common ailments, common conditions, minor illnesses, self-limiting conditions, self-treatable conditions or ambulatory conditions) are generally defined as “common or self-limiting or uncomplicated conditions which can be diagnosed and managed without medical intervention.”​[^[13]] Minor ailments represent an important aspect of self-care, given that the public is more apt to self-treat such ailments. Generally speaking, minor illnesses are short term. The most common in Canada are muscle aches and pains, cold or flu, headaches, cough, back pain, heartburn and indigestion, allergies, insomnia, and menstrual cramps.​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Approximately 28% of Canadian adults experience viral upper respiratory infections (e.g., the common cold) each month, costing the health-care system $625 million annually in physician visits alone.​[^[16]] Ten complaints accounted for 75% of the costs associated with minor ailment consultations in the United Kingdom: back pain, indigestion, dermatitis, nasal congestion, constipation, migraine, acne, cough, sprains/strains and headache.​[^[17]] 

Discussions of *self-care* and *minor illness* often go hand in hand, but they are not the same. Self-care is the broad approach taken for the target illness, be it *minor* or otherwise. The following examples aid in differentiating the 2. A person might seek medical care for a minor illness, disregarding any self-care measures in the process. A common example would be visiting a doctor for a cold rather than staying home and drinking warm fluids. On the other hand, a person can engage in self-care activities for a *serious* illness. Elevating one's feet when they are swollen due to heart failure is an example. Recognition is growing that serious chronic conditions do involve a tremendous investment in self-care.​[^[2]]

Some clinicians caution that using *minor* or *self-limiting* as adjectives to describe these ailments could be perceived as demeaning to pharmacists and patients, as they imply that the patient’s suffering is trivial and that the pharmacists’ intervention insignificant. These clinicians suggest the term *ambulatory ailments*, which avoids undermining the seriousness of the affliction and the professional importance of pharmacist services and training.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] However, *minor ailments* has been an internationally accepted term that is extensively cited in the literature; any change in terminology, therefore, may cause confusion amongst clinicians, researchers and patients.​[^[19]] Irrespective of vocabulary used, pharmacists have a long history of helping Canadians manage these conditions, often using nonprescription medications and, more recently, using prescription therapies in select jurisdictions (see Pharmacist Prescribing).​[^[20]] 

#### The Public's Response to Illness

When ill, patients initiate a complex process to determine how best to return to health. This includes an assessment of symptom severity and how they will impact day-to-day life, all within the context of their present health, social circumstances, finances and other forces.​[^[21]]

Several options may be considered: do nothing (wait-and-see approach), use a nonmedicated form of treatment (like a warm compress or bed rest), take some form of medication or opt to seek professional care. In the United Kingdom, 87% of patients report self-treating minor illnesses often, with 42% saying they do it all the time.​[^[22]] Americans took the following actions for their most recent health condition (multiple responses allowed): used a nonprescription/over-the-counter (OTC) drug (77%), adopted a wait-and-see approach (69%), consulted a doctor (43%) or used a prescription medicine (38%).​[^[23]] In broad terms, people tend to self-treat symptoms such as cold, flu, cough, sore throat, headache, heartburn, constipation and indigestion. When people experience backache, red eyes, depression or chesty cough, they prefer to consult health professionals.​[^[14]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]

If minor ailments do not overly interfere with normal activities, doing nothing is the common approach. In Canada, 66% of sufferers usually wait and see if their symptoms improve before taking medication, while 24% take medications as soon as they feel unwell.​[^[26]] Situations most likely to be left untreated in the United Kingdom have been thinning hairline, bruises and tiredness.​[^[27]] If the situation exceeds the comfort level for self-assessment, a person may ask for advice. This is not a given, of course, as some may still engage in self-care inappropriately. Before involving professional care, many may have already attempted some form of action.​[^[26]]​[^[28]] In America, 81% of adults claimed to use nonprescription medicines as a first response to minor ailments.​[^[29]] 

#### Self-Medication

#### Pros and Cons of Self-Medication

There is benefit in the self-medication of minor ailments; it is safe and effective when done within appropriate parameters. Self-medication can free up both patient time and physician workload, reducing costs and the number of emergency-room visits. Physicians report that many consults involving minor illnesses could be handled by less formalized care.​[^[17]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]] Another benefit is there may be a sense of accomplishment in effectively caring for one's own health, which may motivate a person to take on more responsibility. 

Conversely, attempts at self-care and self-treatment can sometimes delay professional care and may worsen some conditions, leading to serious and/or costly complications. Less monitoring by a health-care professional carries a degree of risk. At the time H2-receptor antagonists were switched to nonprescription status, British physicians’ concerns included masking of serious conditions, missed diagnoses, loss of control by the doctor and the inappropriate use of drugs.​[^[32]] While nonprescription medications have favourable safety profiles, they still have the potential for side effects and drug interactions. 

Self-medication has financial implications. Nonprescription medicines may be less expensive than those prescribed for a patient, depending on insurance coverage. Self-medication can reduce the financial burden on government health-care budgets, with those costs tending to be transferred to the public. A study of 7 European countries found that more than 11.5 billion euros could be saved annually if self-medication were increased.​[^[33]] Industry data suggest that every dollar spent on nonprescription medicines saves the American health-care system $6–$7.​[^[34]] Canadian industry figures determined that if the 16% of people who saw a doctor for mild cold or flu symptoms practised self-care instead, it would save $98 million annually.​[^[16]]

Several authorities have considered using nonprescription sales figures as an early detection system for public health concerns (including infectious outbreaks).​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]]

#### Patterns of Medicine Use

Approximately 3000 nonprescription products and over 20 000 marketed natural health products are available for human use in Canada.​[^[38]] The self-care product industry in Canada generated approximately $5.35 billion in sales in 2017.​[^[39]] Nonprescription medicines and medical non-durables represented 14.8% of all drug expenditure in Canada.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] By category, the most significant areas were analgesics ($593 million), vitamins ($418 million), other natural health supplements ($582 million), cough and cold products ($288 million), allergy and sinus remedies ($232 million), therapies for upset stomach ($167 million), and laxatives ($151 million).​[^[39]]

Many people frequently turn to these agents for symptom relief; they are an essential component of most health-care systems. Six of the 10 most frequently used medicines in the United States (including the top 4) were available without prescription.​[^[41]] More Americans had taken a nonprescription medication during a 6-month period in 2001 than a prescription drug.​[^[24]] Those who did used an average of 2.2 per month; slightly over one-quarter were taking 3 or more agents. Almost 75% of older adults using prescribed medicines were concurrently using nonprescription medicines, dietary supplements or both.​[^[42]] Over a 30-day period, 53.7% of 3-year-old children had been given a nonprescription product.​[^[43]]

In Canada, the BeMedWise survey found that 66% of respondents had purchased a nonprescription product within the past 6 months; as many as 12% were using 1 agent on a daily basis.​[^[44]] Industry data found the figure for daily use to be approximately 42%.​[^[45]] Over half of Ontario seniors were reported to be using 1 or more nonprescription medicines.​[^[46]] 

The propensity for use varies with factors such as gender, age, geographic location, educational attainment, income level, marital status, health status and race. Women appear to have higher consumption rates than men.​[^[23]]​[^[45]] Young adults can also be prominent users of nonprescription medications.​[^[47]] The specific types of products change with age.​[^[48]] Older adults use more laxatives than youths, while the opposite trend has been found for analgesics.​[^[49]] In Canada, young adults tend to use a wide range of products on an infrequent basis, whereas older adults have lower consumption rates overall but are heavier users of a limited number of products. Seniors may be more inclined to seek professional care for symptoms.​[^[15]] People with higher levels of education and household incomes may be more likely to use nonprescription medications.​[^[14]]​[^[47]]​[^[49]]​[^[50]]

#### Sources of Health-Care Advice

Most people are likely to suffer through multiple episodes of minor ailments. Action will be taken and its value ascertained by the user. Over time, a repertoire of skills will evolve based on those experiences.

People likely learn about health issues by first attempting to deal with them on their own. They consider the information they already have; things they have read or seen in the media and learned from personal experience. If this fails, they will look beyond themselves to seek advice from a circle of family, friends and other trusted intimates.​[^[51]] The importance of family and friends as sources of lay information cannot be underestimated. Perhaps because they possess less experience, younger adults are more likely than older adults to consult family and friends. If they are still unsuccessful, they will move on to a third circle to consult with experts. This could be more common for first instances or in rare situations.

As might be expected, people tend to look for information on a condition once it affects them, not before. Few participants in Canadian focus groups, with the exception of young mothers, had made any attempt to learn about self-care before being afflicted with a specific ailment.​[^[52]] Canadians do, however, claim they seek out information on the products they use, albeit more for prescribed agents than nonprescription medications.​[^[53]] Women and those 35 years of age and over were most likely to regularly seek information for first-time medicine use. In a survey in which people were asked to consider an antacid, a cold medicine, a laxative or an analgesic, young and older adults responded similarly regarding the extent to which they read product labels.​[^[54]] Older adults took almost twice as much time as younger adults to view information, but were also more organized in their searches. Both groups took less time to review information about pain relievers, as almost all subjects had previously used or purchased them.

Package labelling provides critical information to nonprescription medicine users. In most countries, a medicine that cannot be taken safely and effectively by following directions provided on (and in) the package is likely to remain available by prescription only. Accordingly, much interest has been shown in the readability of information and the public's propensity to look at it. Of further concern are adult literacy and numeracy skills. 

Industry data indicate that 91% of Canadians claim to read labels carefully before using a product for the first time​[^[55]] and appear to be satisfied with it.​[^[14]] Re-reading a label was necessary for 77% of Americans when giving the medication to a child or if they hadn't read the label for some time.​[^[24]] British patients surveyed during medical visits also indicated strong agreement for reading package instructions when taking a medicine for the first time.​[^[56]]

Less enthusiastic results from older Canadian government data found that 62% of participants stated they *always* read labels, 16% *often* read them, 9% reported *sometimes*, 6% did this *seldom*, while 7% *never* read them.​[^[57]] National consumer surveys in the United States and Canada suggest that most people do not read all of the information appearing on the package prior to first purchase.​[^[24]]​[^[58]] Only 40% of Canadians read active ingredients, followed by the dosage (34%), the symptoms the drug treats (26%), possible side effects (23%), directions for use (18%) and warnings (10%) when buying a product for the first time.​[^[58]]

Americans were asked to indicate which drug information source(s) they had used within a 6-month period. The top 4 sources were advertising or promotion from TV/newspapers/magazines (49.7%), followed by a doctor (47%), articles or information from TV/newspapers/magazines (46%), and from a pharmacist (38%).​[^[24]] A Canadian survey showed that 65% of respondents *always/often* obtained nonprescription information from pharmacists, followed by advertising (63%), media reports (57%), word of mouth (53%), physicians (34%), product labels (20%) and the internet (10%).​[^[59]]

Internet use has undoubtedly grown.​[^[60]] In 2016, “health” accounted for approximately 5% of the 2 trillion Google searches worldwide.​[^[61]]​[^[62]] Of the top 10 most searched health topics in 2017, 8 of them were amenable to self-care practices.​[^[63]] Today, to be used successfully, the internet still requires skills in eHealth literacy that not all users possess.​[^[60]]​[^[62]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]] Nonprescription medicine purchases over the internet may have inherent risks as well.​[^[66]]​[^[67]] While many health-care professionals question the value of the internet due to lack of empiric data,​[^[68]] at least 1 review suggested it has generally had a positive impact on consumer health.​[^[69]]

For many, doctors and pharmacists are the most accessed sources of information; doctors are seen as a first choice for some.​[^[70]] Mothers in the United Kingdom often consulted a pharmacist if their children had coughs, colds, or aches and pains, but turned to their doctor for childhood fever, sickness, diarrhea and rashes.​[^[71]] Other people turn to their pharmacist first when professional intervention is considered.

Patients appear to have a subconscious threshold after which they deem it necessary to seek care. Subjects were asked to consider situations such as *cough today* versus *cough for several days* and *diarrhea today* versus *diarrhea for several days*.​[^[72]] While higher risk was attributed to the longer-lasting scenarios, it appeared to be less risky from a social perspective to discuss a problem if it had persisted for several days. In other words, it may be less embarrassing at that point. A desire not to bother a doctor or waste his/her time has been observed.​[^[73]]

With the introduction of Telehealth in some jurisdictions and the rise of sharing health experiences using social media,​[^[74]] the dynamics of how or when the public turns to physicians or pharmacists (or any other source) may change.

#### Regulations

#### Global Perspectives

Nonprescription medications are regulated in all Western countries. Differences exist, however, among the drugs that are classified as nonprescription and the nature of these restrictions.​[^[75]]​[^[76]]​[^[77]] The Netherlands added a new over-the-counter (OTC) category in 2007 to allow greater product access. Before that, all agents were restricted to pharmacy sale. Contact with a pharmacist is now not required. Italy relaxed requirements for sale by making all OTCs available in nonpharmacy outlets, but a pharmacist must be on the premises in any outlet that sells them. Australia and New Zealand have a prescription category and 3 OTC categories: behind-the-counter (BTC), pharmacy-only and OTC. France has 4 drug schedules. The United Kingdom has BTC and OTC categories for nonprescription medicines, where the OTC category allows for sale from nonpharmacy outlets. Its BTC category is under the supervision of a pharmacist, but counter assistants can be involved in some transactions. In the United Kingdom, pharmacists have been advised to use structured counselling protocols when discussing OTC medicines with the public.​[^[65]]

There is less pharmacy control in the United States, where a nonprescription product may be sold from any retail outlet. However, many drugs available without prescription in other parts of the world require prescriptions in the United States. The American pharmacy profession has lobbied for years to obtain a pharmacist-only category of drug distribution (a third category of medicine). Supporters state such a move would better ensure public safety as agents are switched to OTC status. There is also concern that the sale of potent agents is increasingly in the hands of unskilled retailers. Opponents of the category argue that it goes against free-market principles and that stringent labelling requirements are enough to ensure public safety. Some states have adopted the spirit of a pharmacist-controlled category in an effort to curb pseudoephedrine diversion to crystal meth production. In 2012, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration announced the Nonprescription Drug Safe Use Regulatory Expansion initiative, which would allow select prescription products to be available as nonprescription if specific restrictions are followed.​[^[78]] In July 2018, a draft document proposing criteria for the conditions of safe use was released.​[^[79]] 

#### Canadian Drug Schedules

In 1991, Health Canada implemented changes to the drug scheduling system. The main thrust was to harmonize the 10 provincial systems already in place, enabling firms to advertise nationally and allowing the public to purchase products under similar conditions in each province. Previously, significant differences existed across jurisdictions; a product sold in 3 provinces could have had 3 different conditions of sale. The legislation resulted in 4 drug categories: a prescriptive schedule, sale by pharmacists only (BTC; no public access), pharmacy-only sale, and no sales restrictions (unscheduled). 

The National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) developed scheduling criteria corresponding to the level of professional intervention and advice necessary for the safe and effective use of drugs by consumers. Drug scheduling is now guided by an advisory committee of NAPRA, the National Drug Scheduling Advisory Committee (NDSAC). When NDSAC considers the placement of a drug, the drug is assessed for a series of factors for each schedule. The factors are based on differing degrees of counselling or supervision necessary to encourage appropriate use. Progressively less professional control is required in moving from Schedule I to Unscheduled (see Table 1). The usual impetus for considering a change in drug status is by manufacturer request. 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Schedule I | Drugs that require a prescription as a condition of sale. |
| Schedule II | Drugs that are available only from a pharmacist and without a prescription. There is no opportunity for patient self-selection. |
| Schedule III | Drugs that are available without a prescription from the self-selection area of a pharmacy, which is operated under the direct supervision of a pharmacist. |
| Unscheduled | Drugs not listed in Schedules I, II or III that may be sold from any retail outlet. Unscheduled drugs can be sold without professional supervision. |


A drug under review is first assessed using the factors for Schedule I (prescription). Should sufficient factors apply, the drug remains in this schedule. If not, the drug is assessed against the factors for Schedule II. One factor in Schedule II is as follows: *the drug may cause serious or significant adverse drug reactions or drug interactions that cannot be adequately addressed through product labelling*. If the agent fails to meet the stipulations of this schedule, it is subsequently assessed against the factors in Schedule III (pharmacy only). One Schedule III example is *the drug is a new ingredient for self-medication and the availability of the pharmacist to provide advice can promote appropriate use*. Should the drug not meet the factors for any schedule, it becomes unscheduled and can be sold in any retail outlet. Canadian pharmacists appear to favour tighter control for some existing unscheduled agents,​[^[80]] and have reservations about lessening restrictions on other agents used in chronic conditions.​[^[81]]

#### Professional Control of Pharmacist-Only (Schedule II) Products

When a patient describes symptoms to a pharmacist, the course of action to be taken is clear: the patient and symptoms are assessed and a recommendation is made. Most requests for a pharmacist-only product, however, occur as a result of a product request at the counter specifically by name. Symptoms may not even be mentioned. When a patient directly asks for a Schedule II product by name, to what extent should pharmacists assess the purchase?

Product requests made in this manner can be problematic.​[^[82]] British pharmacists have stated that detailed questioning may not be necessary when consumers request specific products and may even be counterproductive in terms of customer satisfaction.​[^[83]] A similar position is that pharmacists must be readily available to advise pharmacy customers, but do not necessarily have to be involved in every request for a medicine.​[^[84]] 

Pharmacists may face a professional dilemma in this area. Many customers request medicines they have used before. Under these circumstances, questioning from a pharmacist may be perceived as interference or interrogation. Conversely, the sale of medicines without professional input could impact on patient care and may weaken the argument for restricting them to BTC status. Previous use does not guarantee the agent is being used correctly. In recognition of the problem, the International Pharmaceutical Federation stated:​[^[85]] *When a nonprescription medicine is requested by name, the pharmacist should not assume that the inquirer has adequate knowledge of the medicinal product. In all cases the person should be asked if any other medication is being taken and if the medicine has been used previously before deciding whether the medicine requested is appropriate for supply or whether it is necessary to ask additional questions before deciding on the advice to be given.*

#### The Role of the Pharmacist in Self-Care

Advising consumers on self-care is one of the pharmacist's main responsibilities. Duties are outlined in the standards of pharmacy practice, including those of NAPRA. In general, when it is requested or deemed appropriate, a pharmacist will assess the patient's situation and then consider 1 of 3 recommendations: provide assurance that drug therapy is unnecessary; suggest treatment with nonpharmacologic measures or a nonprescription product, or both; or refer the patient to the appropriate medical practitioner with or without self-care recommendations for the interim. 

A tremendous number of consultations take place every year in pharmacies. Over a 5-month period in 1992 in British Columbia, pharmacists in 56 pharmacies were involved in 3480 interventions involving nonprescription products.​[^[86]] On a national scale, the Community Pharmacy Intervention Study (CPhIS) provided data from 524 pharmacies.​[^[87]] According to pharmacists’ records, requests for advice on minor illnesses were made an average of 2.8 times a day (ranging from 0–36 requests) although significant underreporting is possible. Extrapolating these estimates nationally, Canadian pharmacies would have made nearly 50 000 interventions each business day or over 15 million interventions during that year.

When consumers make purchases in pharmacies, however, most transactions occur without a pharmacist's assistance. Product sales have been tracked in pharmacies in Ireland; 632 medicines were purchased during the study period, of which 22.3% were sold with advice.​[^[88]] In Australian pharmacies, 27.5% of transactions involved advice following symptom presentation.​[^[89]] A small Canadian study observed 860 consumers in 1 city making purchases; 11.6% received advice when selecting a product.​[^[90]] In Europe, most nonprescription medications sold in pharmacies are personally recommended by pharmacists—a testament to the strong influence pharmacists can have on a patient’s choice and use of nonprescription products.​[^[91]] Consumers generally initiate the interaction and appear ready to accept recommendations made by pharmacists.

A recent online survey with 500 respondents showed that individuals who consulted a pharmacist before purchasing nonprescription products were not only better able to identify side effects and take appropriate action than the group that did not consult the pharmacist, but they were also significantly more likely to say that they would consult a pharmacist in the future. The authors concluded that it is imperative for individuals to be able to consult with pharmacists, *to improve consumers’ awareness of side effects and to self-medicate appropriately, and hence improve their quality of life*.​[^[92]]

Pharmacist assistance in the product selection process is beneficial to the Canadian health-care system. CPhIS data suggests that pharmacist interventions could save the system $265.6 million per year.​[^[87]] Interventions by pharmacists have been tracked to assess the impact on identification of drug therapy problems.​[^[93]] Researchers in California directed pharmacy students to offer help to consumers as they were inspecting a particular product. Over 12 weeks, 277 encounters took place and of those, 7.2% had the potential for people to purchase the wrong medication.​[^[94]] The same team later expanded the project to 5 pharmacies within the state and found that 1.3% of customers were referred to a physician, 13.4% ended up not buying a product and 25.4% purchased a different product than intended (although this was mainly based on trade name to- generic conversion).​[^[95]]

#### Providing Education and Collaborative Care

The pharmacist is responsible for educating the patient on properly identifying signs and symptoms of conditions amenable to self-diagnosis and ways to effectively self-treat. Also important is assisting patients in recognizing circumstances when it would be more appropriate to consult a physician or emergency medical care. This requires that pharmacists exercise enhanced clinical judgment, with particular attention to the presence of alarm features, previous treatment attempts and behaviours suggesting avoidance of care. Accurately identifying the need for further medical assessment is crucial for avoiding delays in the treatment of more serious ailments. When patients understand the symptoms that correspond with their disease, they can recognize these symptoms early on and more effectively manage their disease as well as prevent complications and recurrences.​[^[96]]​[^[97]] An analysis of more than 30 000 patients found that individuals who are the least skilled and confident in making health-care decisions have increased medical costs compared with those who are the most confident.​[^[98]] This suggests that better informing patients about their conditions and appropriate self-care choices may reduce costs to patients and the health-care system as well as improve health outcomes.​[^[12]] Education specifically designed for the patient’s level of understating is central to self-care monitoring.​[^[96]]

Pharmacists are well-positioned to provide education on the proper use of selected self-care products and to monitor safety endpoints at appropriate timeframes. Note that monitoring for safety is also important for some nonprescription products, even when used appropriately; NSAIDs, for example, can cause serious adverse gastrointestinal effects even when used at low doses and for short durations, warranting continuous pharmacist monitoring.​[^[99]] 

Last but not least, collaboration with other HCPs is a key step in implementing system-wide improvements to facilitate the delivery of safe and effective self-care and to reduce health-care costs. 

#### Facilitating Safe and Effective Self-Care

Appropriate use of nonprescription medications is dependent on the knowledge, perceptions and related behaviours of both pharmacists and their patients. Inappropriate use of nonprescription products can increase morbidity, mortality and related health-care costs. One reason for this is that these medications have the potential to interact with prescription products, causing adverse events, especially in vulnerable patient populations (e.g., older adults, immunocompromised individuals). The increased risk of adverse outcomes secondary to self-medication in these groups may be related to the presence of multiple disease states, higher prescription drug use, and/or impairments in activities of daily living. Other vulnerable patient populations include infants, children, and women who are pregnant or lactating. For example, serious drug-related problems have occurred in pregnant women following the use of contraindicated nonprescription medications (e.g., NSAIDs in the 3​[^rd] trimester).​[^[100]] Thus, pharmacists should ensure patients understand that self-care products are not without safety risks, and emphasize the importance of using these products as directed. 

Nonprescription and natural health product drug misuse and abuse includes using these products for reasons other than those intended and/or exceeding recommended dosages.​[^[101]] Factors that may contribute to inappropriate nonprescription drug use include public perception that these medications are without safety concerns and ease of procurement.​[^[101]] Inappropriate self-medication practices can lead to notable patient harm. Exceeding maximum recommended doses for vitamin D, for example, can cause hypercalcemia and subsequent renal complications; an increasingly relevant concern as the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency rises and supplementation becomes more popular.​[^[102]]​[^[103]] 

Rates of nonprescription drug abuse have increased over time. Evidence suggests that nonprescription drug abuse can occur in all patient populations. However, those with mental health issues, pain disorders and diseases of aging may be more susceptible.​[^[101]] Although abused products vary from country to country, a 2013 systematic review identified codeine products, laxatives, sedative antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate), cough products (e.g., dextromethorphan) and decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine) as the 5 most commonly abused drug classes worldwide.​[^[104]] Additionally, discovery of loperamide’s ability to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms at high doses has led to its abuse and toxicity.​[^[105]] Detecting and deterring misuse and abuse of such agents continue to be an important aspect of practice for pharmacists.

#### Pharmacist Prescribing

While nonprescription drug therapy can effectively manage certain conditions, many minor ailments can be far more complex, often requiring prescription drugs for effective and long-term treatment.​[^[106]]​[^[107]] Under these circumstances, allowing pharmacists to prescribe would eliminate the need for many of these patients to seek care elsewhere (e.g., emergency department, physician’s office), improving the efficiency of care, reducing physician visits and increasing the accessibility to prescription medication.​[^[106]]​[^[108]] Pharmacists prescribing for minor ailments (PPMA) programs grant pharmacists the option of selecting medications traditionally under control of prescribers for minor ailment treatment.​[^[106]] 

#### Rationale

There is considerable worry about the escalating costs of care as well as access to physicians.​[^[20]] In 2017, it was estimated that total health expenditure in Canada reached $242 billion, or $6,604 per person, representing 11.5% of the gross domestic product.​[^[109]] A 2013 report estimated that introducing a pharmacist-led prescribing program involving 9 minor ailments could save $12.3 million over 5 years in Ontario alone.​[^[110]] In 2016, 15.8% of Canadians 12 years of age and older (approximately 4.8 million people) reported that they did not have a regular health-care provider.​[^[111]] A survey showed that physicians in Saskatchewan estimated 10–30% of their consultations were for minor ailments.​[^[20]] In the United Kingdom, 40% of general practitioner (GP) consultations and 8% of accident and emergency department visits are for minor ailments.​[^[112]] One study found minor ailments account for 13.2% of visits to GPs and 5.3% of emergency department visits in Scotland.​[^[113]] Arguably, if these consults were managed in the pharmacy setting, this could alleviate wait times for, and increase access to, physician care. Realizing the cost-saving potential and convenience afforded, several countries have implemented PPMA, with no reported compromises in patient safety, quality of care or efficacy of treatment.​[^[13]]​[^[97]]​[^[114]]​[^[115]] Furthermore, research shows that GPs are generally in favour of diverting the care of minor ailments to other care settings. Some are concerned with the ethics of pharmacists diagnosing, then prescribing an agent, as well as whether pharmacist-directed care will be of an appropriate standard.​[^[20]] Although data is limited, the public response to PPMA has been positive, with patients seeking pharmacists’ help judiciously.​[^[20]] Support from key stakeholders has fuelled the rapid evolution and expansion of PPMA in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Sweden. 

#### Distribution of Prescriptive Authority

Regulations differ from country to country and even between jurisdictions within the same country. The United Kingdom has the longest history of nontraditional prescribing, dating back to 2003.​[^[116]] There, Pharmacy-based Minor Ailment Schemes (PMASs) allow pharmacists to supply any nonprescription agent in addition to a prescription medication through locally agreed protocols, or by supplementary and independent prescribing.​[^[113]] In Canada, Alberta became the first province to allow prescribing by pharmacists in 2007. Pharmacists in this province have more autonomy, as they can prescribe most medications and are not limited to specific ailments. All the remaining provinces have since allowed for some degree of prescriptive authority by pharmacists for approved conditions. Pharmacists in Saskatchewan are limited to selecting from a set formulary of medications for a specified condition and must follow a detailed protocol. There is no overarching national initiative, and government reimbursement (or lack thereof) of the service also varies by province.​[^[20]] Saskatchewan is currently the only province where pharmacists are compensated by the provincial government for prescribing treatments for minor ailments. 

#### Evaluation of Services

While the evaluation of clinical outcomes subsequent to pharmacist prescribing for minor ailments in Canada is limited, the results to date are promising.​[^[117]]​[^[118]] In 1 small study out of Saskatchewan, symptom resolution was high, with 86.7% of patients reporting a change that was significant or greater.​[^[118]] Patient satisfaction with the service in general was also positive.​[^[117]] One United Kingdom review showed a high proportion of patients reported complete resolution of symptoms after a PMAS consultation (ranging from 68–94%) and a low rate of GP re-consultation following PMAS use (ranging from 2.4–23.4%).​[^[13]] Another United Kingdom study demonstrated comparable symptomatic and quality-of-life outcomes for individuals seeking treatment for minor ailments from an emergency department, a GP or a community pharmacy.​[^[97]] A recently published systematic review summarizing the evidence around the views and experiences of a diverse range of stakeholders on pharmacist prescribing globally was predominantly positive,​[^[116]] reaffirming previous research results.​[^[119]] The success of PPMA programs has emphasized the value of pharmacists as care providers and encourages further expansion of pharmacists’ scope of practice and pharmacy-based services. Such initiatives may further reduce strain on health-care systems and facilitate sustainability. 

#### Conclusion

The global health-care system, faced with a growing and aging population, is expected to undergo significant changes in order to remain economically viable while improving the access to and efficiency of care. Self-care and self-medication will continue to be powerful forces driving these changes in society and for HCPs.​[^[12]] Understanding how consumers manage minor illnesses is important, more so as growing numbers of increasingly potent prescription products are considered for reclassification to nonprescription status.​[^[120]]​[^[121]]​[^[122]]​[^[123]]​[^[124]] Research shows that encouraging pharmacist-guided self-care and PPMA programs are effective means of reducing health-care costs without compromising quality of care. Essential to the success of these initiatives is identifying opportunities for increasing public awareness of pharmacists’ expertise in self-care and improving patient engagement.​[^[125]]​[^[126]]

Concern continues about adverse events associated with *all* medicines, including nonprescription medications. Pharmacists have a key role in reducing risk during use. It is also crucial that the public appropriately perceive them as medicines that require careful use. That said, the potential to safely self-medicate has never been better. Hundreds of self-help brochures are available to aid the consumer. Pharmacists and physicians continue to provide support. The internet has many portals for minor illnesses, and phone-in lines (either stand-alone or associated with a product) are available.

Pharmacists have a balancing act to perform: being aware of patients' need for information, helping prevent illness, intervening when problems arise, continuing to build public perception that nonprescription products are medicines requiring due care, and at the same time not being paternalistic and impinging on patients' opportunity to choose medication. Life-long learning to stay current is paramount if pharmacists wish to optimize their unique qualifications and accessibility in the community as preeminent self-care advisors and drug therapy managers in this rapidly changing self-care environment.​[^[12]]​[^[127]]
