#### Introduction

This chapter describes the recommended therapy for several dental conditions: dentin hypersensitivity (sensitive teeth), cracked tooth syndrome, postendodontic discomfort, acute alveolar osteitis (dry socket), pulpal inflammation (pulpitis), pulp necrosis, apical periodontitis and apical abscess.

For patient assessment, see Figure 1. For an illustration of tooth anatomy, see . Throughout the discussion, the anatomical term “apical” refers to the direction toward the apex or root tip; “coronal” refers to the direction toward the crown, or external or visible part of the tooth.

#### Pain Management in Dental Conditions

Several of the dental conditions discussed in this chapter involve acute dental pain, which can usually be managed with NSAIDs, acetaminophen or a combination of both. Evidence suggests that the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is more effective than either agent alone and may be more effective than most commonly prescribed opioids, such as codeine.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Opioids should not be prescribed unless there is an absolute contraindication to other therapeutic options or there is persistent pain despite optimized dosing.​[^[3]] If prescribed, limit quantities to a 1–2 day supply. For more information on commonly prescribed analgesics and antibacterials for dental conditions, see Table 2 and Table 3; see also: Drugs in Dentistry.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of corticosteroids for management of postoperative pain and inflammation​.​[^[4]]

#### Choices During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Regular dental care during pregnancy and breastfeeding is recommended.​[^[5]] Oral radiography is considered safe in pregnancy, as long as appropriate shielding and protection is provided (e.g., lead apron, thyroid collar, high-speed films).​[^[6]] Pregnant patients requiring essential and/or emergency treatment should receive the minimum number of x-rays needed for diagnostic purposes; elective x-rays should be deferred until after pregnancy.​[^[7]] 

#### Pregnancy

Acetaminophen is considered safe to use during pregnancy and is the drug of choice.​[^[8]] Avoid NSAIDs in the third trimester, due to increased risk of premature closure of ductus arteriosus. NSAIDs are not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to increased risk of oligohydramnios.​[^[9]] If NSAIDs are necessary, prescribe the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible. Use beyond 48 hours may require ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected.

As with nonpregnant patients, reserve opioids for severe pain that is unresponsive to other options. Although opioids are considered generally safe in pregnancy, there is some evidence to suggest a possible small increased risk of congenital anomalies, particularly oral clefts, with first-trimester exposure.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] If opioids are used in late pregnancy, monitor the newborn for signs and symptoms of withdrawal.

Fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and clarithromycin are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Penicillins may be preferable options.

#### Breastfeeding

Acetaminophen is considered safe to use during breastfeeding and is the drug of choice. Most NSAIDs are safe to use during breastfeeding. Ibuprofen is preferred due to its short half-life and extensive history of use in this patient population. As with nonbreastfeeding patients, reserve opioids for severe pain that is unresponsive to other options. Codeine is not recommended during breastfeeding, as those who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 (which converts codeine to morphine) may have resultant high levels of morphine in their breast milk.​[^[12]] Morphine may be a safer opioid alternative.

For a discussion of general principles of drug use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, see: Drug Use During Pregnancy and Drug Use During Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Dentin Hypersensitivity

#### Pathophysiology

Dentin is a component of tooth structure, along with enamel, cementum and pulp. It is composed of tubules containing fluid that is in contact with the pulp. External stimuli disturb or cause movement of this fluid, thereby activating the nociceptive receptors in the pulp and leading to the perception of pain.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] 

Dentin hypersensitivity, also known as sensitive teeth, is characterized by sharp pain of short duration arising from exposed dentin in response to various stimuli that cannot be ascribed to any other dental defect or pathology. Dentin can become exposed due to gingival recession (from toothbrush abrasion or periodontal disease), enamel loss (from consumption of acidic foods and beverages or vigorous tooth brushing with an abrasive toothpaste) or abfraction (a noncarious lesion) occurring at the cementoenamel junction on the lingual or buccal side of the tooth. Painful stimuli are generally chemical (e.g., acid, tooth whitening treatments), thermal (e.g., cold or hot drinks or food, exposure to air), mechanical (e.g., toothbrush, probe, fingernails) or osmotic (e.g., sugar, gel) in nature.

The prevalence of dentin hypersensitivity falls between 4% and 74% of adults.​[^[15]] It is encountered more often in young individuals with root exposure due to rapid gingival recession. Maxillary teeth seem to be more frequently affected, and the buccal surface is the site most often involved.​[^[16]]

#### Prevention

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Fruits | Citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime), pineapple, apple, pomegranate, blueberries, tomato, dried fruits |
| Other foods | Sour candies, tomato-based sauces (ketchup, salsa, pasta sauce) |
| Beverages | Soda, sweetened beverages, sports drinks, flavoured water, fruit juice, coffee, other caffeinated drinks |


#### Treatment

Evidence is insufficient to permit the development of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. The following recommendations are based on clinical experience.​[^[20]]

Chemical or physical blockade of the patent dentinal tubules can prevent movement of the fluid they contain. Physical blockade protects the exposed dentin and occludes the patent tubules. This is achieved by application of fluoride varnishes, sealants, composite resins, glass ionomer cements or soft tissue grafts by the dental professional. Oxalate salt preparations or glutaraldehyde/hydroxyethyl methacrylate (GLUMA), which often provide pain relief soon after administration, may also be applied. In resistant or recurrent cases, the dentist may employ other physical techniques or laser therapy to achieve a fast and more sustained resolution of pain.

Chemical desensitization involves decreasing nerve (pulp) sensitivity via depolarization with potassium salt formulations. **Desensitizing toothpastes** typically contain potassium salts but may also contain strontium, stannous fluoride, nano-hydroxyapatite, arginine or calcium sodium phosphosilicate. These appear to exert their effects via a physical blockade of patent dentin tubules. The results of a meta-analysis of desensitizing toothpastes suggest arginine or nano-hydroxyapatite may be more effective than others.​[^[21]] 

Desensitizing toothpastes should be applied with a soft or ultra-soft toothbrush. Several commercially available products have received the Canadian Dental Association (CDA) seal of approval (e.g., Sensodyne, Colgate Sensitive, Crest Pro-Health, NovaMin). Advise patients that it may take up to 2 weeks to achieve benefit from a desensitizing agent.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, see: Dentifrices. 

#### Cracked Tooth Syndrome

#### Pathophysiology

Sudden pain that occurs on biting and ceases after the pressure is withdrawn is a classic sign of a cracked tooth.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] The pain may be sharp, intense, and of short duration and may occur when eating or when biting on an object, e.g., pencil. Although the usual stimulus is biting, some patients experience sensitivity to thermal changes (particularly cold) or upon exposure to sweets.​[^[24]] The pain may originate from the pulp or the periodontium.

A cracked tooth can occur as a result of trauma, extensive filling, or when an intact tooth with an opposing cusp is occluding against a marginal ridge or a foreign body such as a lingual barbell worn by individuals with tongue piercings.

#### Treatment

Refer the patient to a dentist; various restorative techniques are used to treat cracked teeth.​[^[25]] The prognosis depends on the type and the extent of the crack. A poor prognosis is associated with fractures occurring below the level of the alveolar bone; in these cases, extraction is usually required. 

#### Postendodontic Discomfort

#### Pathophysiology

An endodontic treatment (root canal) is a procedure used to eliminate pulpal and periapical diseases. Root canals involve mechanical and biochemical débridement and treatment of the canal system of the affected tooth. Discomfort following endodontic treatment is common. Less commonly, the apical extrusion of debris produced during the procedure may lead to an acute apical abscess or apical periodontitis, marked by swelling and pain.

#### Treatment

Usually the pain is mild and requires either no medication or mild analgesics. NSAIDs may be the best choice for postendodontic pain; if insufficient, consider adding on acetaminophen.​[^[26]] See Pain Management in Dental Conditions. If swelling is present and an apical or periodontal abscess is suspected, advise the patient to consult a dentist immediately. Appropriate treatment includes draining the abscess through the canal or by incision, and NSAIDs or a combination of analgesics for pain control (see Acute Apical Periodontitis and Acute Apical Abscess).

#### Acute Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket)

#### Pathophysiology

Approximately 1–4% of patients undergoing surgical extraction of an impacted third molar (wisdom tooth) will experience a painful complication known as acute alveolar osteitis (dry socket).​[^[27]] In this condition, the healing process is delayed and the bone of the socket is exposed and extremely sensitive. The moderate to severe pain generally develops 1–3 days after the procedure, is usually dull and throbbing, and often radiates to the ear. The extraction site may have a foul odour and impart a bad taste in the mouth. Regional lymphadenitis may be seen in some patients. Rarely, patients may present with fever that is self-limiting if untreated. The etiology is not completely understood but increased fibrinolytic activity at the surgical site is suspected. Risk factors identified include use of oral contraceptives, traumatic and/or multiple extractions, older age and smoking.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]

#### Treatment

Chlorhexidine oral rinse is commonly prescribed after wisdom tooth extraction prophylactically to prevent alveolar osteitis, especially in high-risk patients (patients who smoke, poor oral hygiene, active inflammation).​[^[30]]​[^[31]]

If patients experience acute alveolar osteitis, advise them to consult a dentist as soon as possible. Treatment generally consists of gentle irrigation of the site with normal saline followed by the insertion of an iodoform gauze soaked with eugenol for pain relief. The dressing may be changed every second to third day for 3–6 days if the pain persists. After a few days and once the pain has resolved, the patient may gently irrigate the site at home using a curved syringe supplied by the dentist.​[^[32]]

Even without intervention, acute alveolar osteitis is not typically associated with any sequelae other than pain throughout the healing period. Provide patients with adequate systemic analgesia such as an **NSAID** and/or acetaminophen. See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

#### Pulpal Inflammation (Pulpitis)

#### Pathophysiology

Pulpitis is usually reversible if there are enough reparative cells remaining in the pulp to allow recovery. If left untreated, it may progress to irreversible pulpitis requiring endodontic therapy to stop the inflammatory process.​[^[14]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]] Reversibility may be preserved if the cause is rapidly removed. Common causes include:​[^[14]]​[^[18]]



When the pulp is exposed to a noxious stimulus, an inflammatory reaction is induced with classic manifestations of:



The main symptom of reversible pulpitis is sensitivity or mild pain of brief duration after exposure to cold, sweets and sometimes heat. The pain subsides upon removal of the stimulus. There is no spontaneous pain or pain on biting. Usually a cause can be identified on dental examination. The type of insult and the patient’s age are important factors that affect whether the pulp can recover. With aging, the ability of the pulp to repair itself diminishes.

If patients experience discomfort following a recent restoration or periodontal scaling, reassure them that the symptoms should diminish and disappear over a 3-month period.

With irreversible pulpitis, the pain can occur spontaneously and it may be more prolonged on exposure to the initial stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis results from significant pulpal injury (e.g., from caries, trauma, or cumulative effect of multiple or deep restorations) and does not respond to removal of the causative factor.​[^[14]]​[^[17]] 

#### Treatment

Reversible pulpitis is treated by correcting the cause.​[^[14]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[35]] In patients experiencing discomfort following restoration or periodontal scaling within a 3-month window, symptomatic treatment (e.g., **desensitizing toothpaste**) may help, and symptoms should be monitored. If the discomfort worsens or lasts longer than 3 months, the patient should seek dental advice.

Caries are treated by removing the decay and placing a filling to occlude the dentinal tubules. If a noninvasive option is preferred, silver diamine fluoride can be applied to manage the caries.​[^[36]] If the cavity is extensive and the exposed pulp is carious, the pulpitis is classified as irreversible. In these cases, the treatment of choice is a root canal.

In some cases, extraction may be necessary. Some dental practitioners pretreat patients with 600 mg of ibuprofen 1 hour pre-extraction, for maximal analgesia.​[^[37]] Postextraction, pain is usually controlled with nonprescription analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen **sodium**) or prescription doses of **NSAIDs**.​[^[35]] See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

There is insufficient evidence to support the benefits of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.​[^[38]]

#### Pulp Necrosis

#### Pathophysiology

Pulp necrosis may result when inflamed pulp degenerates further; causes are the same as those seen with irreversible pulpitis. At this stage, the reparative potential of the pulp is totally absent and the pulp lacks viable tissue. Inflammation of the periapical tissue often occurs in the setting of pulp necrosis.​[^[14]]​[^[18]]

Often, the patient has had a previous episode of symptoms related to irreversible pulpitis. Necrotic pulp does not respond to stimuli such as cold or heat. The patient may feel spontaneous dull and throbbing pain that worsens on lying down or that is stimulated by biting. The latter suggests inflammation of the periapical tissues.​[^[14]]​[^[18]]

#### Treatment

The appropriate treatment options are extraction or endodontic therapy (root canal). An **NSAID** or **acetaminophen** may be prescribed by the dentist for a few days for possible postoperative pain or discomfort.​[^[14]] See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

#### Acute Apical Periodontitis

#### Pathophysiology

Acute apical periodontitis is moderate to severe inflammation of the periodontal tissues located near the apex of a tooth, presenting with pain that may worsen upon biting. Although it is most frequently associated with a pulpal condition (reversible or irreversible inflamed or necrotic pulp), nonpulpal causes have been identified such as trauma or bruxism (grinding or clenching the upper and lower teeth together, often while sleeping). The periapical tissues show a marked inflammatory response with vasodilation and polymorphonuclear lymphocyte infiltration.​[^[14]]​[^[35]]

#### Treatment

Acute apical periodontitis is treated by tooth extraction or endodontic therapy. If endodontic treatment is chosen, canal débridement and drainage should be performed by a dentist on an emergency basis. Generally, the drainage provides partial to complete relief of the pain. Some discomfort may persist for a few days and can be managed with **acetaminophen** or an **NSAID**. See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

#### Chronic Apical Periodontitis

#### Pathophysiology

Chronic apical periodontitis is a type of granuloma with inflammation around the tooth’s root tip. Some patients may be completely asymptomatic and unaware of the problem while others may experience mild sensitivity on biting or percussion (i.e., the dentist may test by tapping on the tooth).​[^[14]]​[^[35]] The condition is usually a low-grade, long-standing response to canal bacteria and irritants and presents as apical radiolucency on x-ray, which is often when the condition is discovered. The cause is usually necrotic pulp, but chronic apical periodontitis may be associated with other conditions including central giant cell granuloma or cemental dysplasia.​[^[14]]​[^[35]]

#### Treatment

Chronic apical periodontitis can be treated with the same modalities as necrotic pulp (extraction or root canal). An analgesic such as **acetaminophen** or an **NSAID** can relieve some potential postprocedural discomfort; antibiotics are usually not indicated.​[^[14]]​[^[35]] See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

#### Acute Apical Abscess

#### Pathophysiology

Acute apical abscess (also known as periapical or periradicular abscess) is an infection resulting from bacterial invasion of the ligament space surrounding the root and/or apex of the tooth. Patients experience severe pain when biting or palpating the affected tooth.​[^[14]] In severe cases, the patient may present with fever, swelling of the tissues adjacent to the tooth, and tenderness of the cervical and submandibular lymph nodes.​[^[39]] 

#### Treatment

The gold standard of therapy is to remove the cause of infection and involves primarily establishing drainage through the root canal by a dentist on an emergency basis.​[^[14]]​[^[18]]​[^[35]] If swelling is severe, drainage of pus through the fluctuant tissue may be required. Routine use of **antibiotics** is not usually recommended; it may be considered in immunocompromised patients.​[^[40]] Antibiotic therapy is recommended if there are signs of systemic involvement (e.g., fever).​[^[41]]

If extraoral (i.e., outside the mouth) swelling occurs, refer the patient to a dentist immediately. If a dentist is not available, the patient should seek medical assistance. Treatment with an antibiotic (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin, azithromycin, moxifloxacin or a combination of metronidazole with amoxicillin) is required.​[^[14]]​[^[39]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]] Clindamycin is no longer recommended as a first-line option in penicillin-allergic patients due to increased risk of *Clostridioides difficile* infections and limited efficacy in odontogenic infections.​[^[44]]​[^[45]] If not treated promptly, the infection may spread to surrounding tissues and structures or lead to sepsis. Severe cases have required drainage of extraoral pus.​[^[42]]​[^[46]] For more information on commonly prescribed antibacterials for dental conditions, see Table 3. 

#### Chronic Apical Abscess

#### Pathophysiology

Chronic apical abscess (also known as suppurative apical periodontitis) refers to an apical lesion that has established drainage through a sinus tract.​[^[18]]​[^[47]] The patient may report a “gumboil” or a foul taste in the mouth. The culprit tooth is usually asymptomatic. Gentle pressure on the gum may expel pus from the fistula.​[^[18]]​[^[42]]​[^[47]] The cause of this condition is usually necrotic pulp. 

#### Treatment

The usual treatment of chronic apical abscess is tooth extraction or a root canal procedure. Analgesics such as **NSAIDs** or **acetaminophen** can relieve potential postprocedural discomfort, and antibiotics are not usually indicated.​[^[14]] See Pain Management in Dental Conditions.

| **amoxicillin** (generics) | 250–500 mg TID PO x 3–7 days | Usually well tolerated. Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from minor rashes to anaphylactic shock). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. | Penicillins may increase serum concentration of methotrexate and decrease serum concentration of the active metabolite of mycophenolate.Tetracyclines may decrease the therapeutic effect of penicillins.May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. | First-line choice for most dental infections. Has a broader spectrum of coverage than penicillin; provides more convenient dosing. |
| **amoxicillin** (Clavulin, Apo-Amoxi Clav, other generics) | 500/125 mg TID x 3–7 days | Usually well tolerated. Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from minor rashes to anaphylactic shock). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.Diarrhea is more common than with amoxicillin alone. | Penicillins may increase serum concentration of methotrexate and decrease serum concentration of the active metabolite of mycophenolate.Tetracyclines may decrease the therapeutic effect of penicillins.May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. | May be considered after failure to respond to penicillin alone or with concurrent chronic sinusitis. |
| **penicillin V** (generics) | 300–600 mg QID PO x 3–7 days | Usually well tolerated. Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from minor rashes to anaphylactic shock). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. | Penicillins may increase serum concentration of methotrexate and decrease serum concentration of the active metabolite of mycophenolate.Tetracyclines may decrease the therapeutic effect of penicillins.May enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin. | First-line choice for most dental infections. Requires administration on an empty stomach (1 h before or 2 h after a meal). |
| **doxycycline** (Doxycycline, other generics) | 100 mg once daily or BID PO x 3–7 days | Gastrointestinal upset; yeast overgrowth; photosensitivity; may increase risk of azotemia; pseudotumor cerebri. | Serum concentrations of tetracyclines may be reduced by antacids, calcium, magnesium and iron salts, carbamazepine, chronic alcohol ingestion, phenobarbital and phenytoin. Methotrexate concentrations may be increased by tetracyclines.Avoid combining with retinoic acid derivatives due to increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri. | Consider in penicillin-allergic patients and infections of periodontal origin. Not recommended for use in children and pregnant patients. |
