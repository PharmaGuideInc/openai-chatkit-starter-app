#### Introduction

The occurrence of a first transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke increases the risk of experiencing a second ischemic event. Patients experiencing a TIA or mild stroke (without disabling deficits) may derive the most long-term benefit from full investigation and treatment. Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke is the main subject of this chapter. Primary prevention of stroke is covered in detail elsewhere (see Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease).

The short-term prognosis after a first TIA is worse for patients with certain characteristics and symptoms; in these individuals, the incidence of stroke within 2 days of TIA is around 8%.​[^[1]] Adverse prognostic indicators include >60 years of age, blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, diabetes mellitus, speech and/or motor symptoms, and duration of symptoms >10 minutes. Accordingly, these higher-risk patients should be promptly investigated and treated, ideally the same day, especially if the symptoms occurred in the past 48 hours.​[^[2]] An evaluation by a physician with stroke expertise is recommended. Studies have reported a substantial reduction in risk associated with optimal urgent management.​[^[3]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Therapeutic options for preventing the recurrence of ischemic stroke are summarized in Figure 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Carotid Endarterectomy



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Antiplatelet agents (see Table 1) are the drugs of choice for long-term prevention of atherothrombotic events (embolic phenomena secondary to intra-arterial disease).​[^[2]]​[^[11]] Oral anticoagulants are used to prevent cerebral ischemic events from emboli presumed to be of cardiac origin (see Supraventricular Tachycardia).

Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments have been shown to be effective for patients who have previously experienced a TIA or an ischemic stroke.​[^[2]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]] Discussion of appropriate treatment options and targets can be found in Dyslipidemias and Hypertension.

#### Antiplatelet Agents

#### Acetylsalicylic Acid

Often given as initial therapy for stroke prevention, ASA, when used in high-risk individuals, results in about a 25% relative risk reduction (RRR) of vascular events (cardiac and cerebral). Its protective effect is more modest in patients with TIA or ischemic stroke, with approximately 13% RRR for the prevention of major vascular events.​[^[11]]​[^[14]] It is well tolerated with side effects that are often dose-dependent. Patient acceptability and low cost are advantages. The recommended dosage for stroke prevention is 80–325 mg/day,​[^[2]] depending on the patient’s tolerance and the clinical situation. 

When combined with an oral anticoagulant, ASA 100 mg/day provides better protection against cardioembolic events than an anticoagulant alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves;​[^[15]] however, this combination does increase the risk of systemic bleeding and should be used with caution.

#### Thienopyridines

Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is somewhat more effective than ASA for the prevention of ischemic events, including stroke, in patients at high risk of ischemic events.​[^[16]] The absolute difference in annual rate of ischemic stroke, MI or vascular death between clopidogrel and ASA is 0.5%, corresponding to an 8.7% RRR in favour of clopidogrel. Thus, clopidogrel is an alternative antiplatelet agent in patients who are allergic to or cannot tolerate ASA.​[^[16]] It can be prescribed as an alternative in patients who have new cerebral ischemic events while on ASA, although there are no clinical trials to support this practice.

In patients with a history of stroke or TIA, combined use of **low-dose ASA and clopidogrel** long-term is associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, and does not significantly reduce the rate of ischemic events, including stroke.​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Long-term use of ASA plus clopidogrel is not routinely recommended for secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.​[^[2]] However, short-term use of the ASA/clopidogrel combination for between 21 and 30 days has recently been shown to be beneficial in the acute setting.​[^[2]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]

#### Dipyridamole/ASA

Dipyridamole/​ASA (200/25 mg) given twice daily reduces the relative risk of stroke by 23% (mostly for ischemic stroke) when compared with ASA in patients with cerebral ischemic symptoms.​[^[22]] This finding was confirmed in a randomized controlled trial in which the incidence of death, stroke, MI or major bleeding complications was significantly lower in patients with cerebral ischemia treated with dipyridamole/ASA than ASA alone (absolute risk reduction 3%, RRR 19% and NNT 34 over a mean of 3.5 years).​[^[23]] No increased risk of cardiac events was reported in the dipyridamole/ASA groups in either study; however, a higher daily dose of ASA may be desirable in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease. The addition of ASA 81 mg once daily to the twice-daily dipyridamole/ASA combination appears reasonable in these patients, though the efficacy and safety of this measure are unknown. Because dipyridamole/ASA is administered twice a day and it is associated with a higher rate of drug discontinuation due to side effects, e.g., headache, it is recommended as a second-line option.

#### Anticoagulants

#### Vitamin K Antagonists

Oral anticoagulants prevent cerebral and systemic emboli in patients with acute MI, valvular and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic cardiac valves. The risk of bleeding is influenced by many factors, e.g., the intensity of anticoagulation, concomitant use of high doses of ASA or other drugs with antiplatelet effects.​[^[24]] Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) are superior to clopidogrel plus ASA for prevention of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke.​[^[25]] For most patients, the INR target is 2.5 with a goal time in therapeutic range >70%.​[^[2]] Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and prior TIA/stroke may require a higher target INR of 3.​[^[26]]

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation based on the results of the RE-LY study.​[^[27]] The oral factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are also approved for this indication.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]] Most clinical practice guidelines consider these novel anticoagulants useful alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention.​[^[2]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] In many cases, these agents are suggested as a first choice, especially for patients in whom anticoagulant therapy needs to be initiated. Overall, they have similar or superior efficacy for the prevention of ischemic events and a comparable if not better safety profile, in particular for intracranial hemorrhages. Cautious patient selection is important, especially in elderly patients with renal insufficiency in whom renal function monitoring is advised. Combining direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists with antiplatelet therapy is not recommended unless there is an additional cardiac indication. Specific agents are available to reverse the antithrombotic effect of these agents in certain circumstances (e.g., urgent surgery).​[^[34]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Secondary Stroke Prevention and Pregnancy

During pregnancy, the risk of stroke is highest during the peripartum and postpartum periods. A multidisciplinary approach including stroke and maternal-fetal medicine expertise is suggested for optimal management and prevention.​[^[35]] 

#### Secondary Stroke Prevention during Pregnancy

The choice of an antithrombotic will depend mostly on the stroke etiology: anticoagulants if cardioembolic or antiplatelet for all other etiologies. If an antiplatelet agent is required, low-dose ASA 81 mg daily would be the medication of choice, as there is less evidence to support the safety of other antiplatelets during pregnancy. When anticoagulation is indicated, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred, warfarin is potentially teratogenic, and insufficient information exists at present for the DOACs during pregnancy. Pharmacological blood pressure management for stroke prevention (ischemic and hemorrhagic) during pregnancy should include as first choices labetalol, methyldopa or long-acting nifedipine. Close monitoring of blood pressure is suggested and the recommended target is < 140/90 (see also Hypertension). Management of hyperlipidemia should be based on a healthy diet and exercise. There is a lack of reliable information regarding the safety of statins during pregnancy; it would thus be reasonable to avoid these drugs.

#### Secondary Stroke Prevention and Breastfeeding

Low-dose ASA is considered safe during breastfeeding, but the safety of other antiplatelet agents is unknown. Warfarin is also considered safe during breastfeeding, but the safety of the DOACs has not been established. The same group of antihypertensive medications considered safe in pregnancy, can be used during breastfeeding. Other drugs may also be considered (see Hypertension). Lipid-lowering medications are not recommended during breastfeeding.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
