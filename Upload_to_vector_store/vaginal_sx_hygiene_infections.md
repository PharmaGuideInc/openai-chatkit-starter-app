#### Vaginal Physiology

The vagina is a fibromuscular structure that connects the external genitalia, or vulva, with the internal cervix and uterus. It provides a channel for the removal of menstrual discharge, and the transverse folds or rugae of the vaginal wall allow the flexibility of size and shape that are required for sexual intercourse and childbirth.

Normal vaginal length is variable but is usually between 8 cm and 10 cm. The vagina is positioned at a 45° angle, upwards and posteriorly. It is in close proximity to the bladder, urethra, perineum and rectum (see Figure 1).​[^[1]]

A healthy vaginal environment is maintained by balancing many host factors including bacterial flora, hormonal influences and the epithelial cells lining the vaginal wall. Estrogen induces the maturation of the epithelial cells and stimulates the proliferation of epithelial basal cells. It also increases the cells’ ability to store glycogen, which is subsequently metabolized to lactic acid by the vaginal bacterium Lactobacillus vaginalis, making the vagina acidic with a pH of 3.5–5.5. The nonpathogenic lactobacilli thrive in the acidic environment while the proliferation of more troublesome microflora is controlled.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]

Normal vaginal discharge varies in quantity, consistency and appearance throughout the menstrual cycle. This discharge can be due to mucus production of the cervical glands, a transudate from the capillaries of the vaginal walls and/or from other sources such as the uterus. Monthly hormone fluctuations are responsible for the changing characteristics of the discharge. Sometimes the discharge is pasty, white or colourless and scanty. Around the time of ovulation, it is wet and slippery with the consistency of uncooked egg white. There may be no apparent discharge on the days immediately after menses has stopped. Vaginal discharge contributes to the health of the vagina and helps to maintain the pH and normal microflora. It should not cause irritation, burning or itching.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

A mild odour may occur when vaginal discharge combines with secretions from glands in the vulvar area. This odour should not be unpleasant or cause concern. Causes of unusual or unpleasant odour, genital irritation or itching may include poor hygiene, allergic or sensitivity reactions to products used, vaginal infections, or a forgotten tampon.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

#### Genital Hygiene

#### Introduction

Proper genital hygiene can be achieved very simply. The perineal area should be washed once daily using warm water and mild unscented soap or hypoallergenic options. The outer labia should be gently separated and the clitoral area cleaned and rinsed. This area can be sensitive to perfumes and harsh ingredients in some soaps, so only mild products should be used. Shower gels, scrubs and bubble baths should be avoided. After cleansing, the perineal area should be rinsed well with warm water to remove soap residue and then gently dried.

The vagina cleanses itself naturally through its secretions and does not require further cleansing.​[^[1]]​[^[5]]



The regular use of panty liners, continence pads and sanitary napkins can also cause vulvar irritation by increasing moisture and temperature of the area, as well as possibly modifying the vulvar skin pH. These products should be changed frequently and their use avoided unless necessary.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[13]]

#### Vaginal Douching

Douching is a process of instilling fluid into the vagina and flushing the cavity. 

There are no substantiated benefits to routine douching and it can be associated with significant adverse outcomes:



Despite the possible adverse outcomes, douching is still used for a variety of reasons. To decrease potential risks, it is important to provide sound advice to help prevent adverse effects. The use of suitable solutions and an appropriate technique are important safety factors. Douching is never recommended as a contraceptive method or as a treatment for a suspected vaginal infection.​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

Examples of douching solutions include:



Instillation of the solution is by means of a vaginal syringe. There are 2 types of syringes—the fountain syringe and the bulb syringe. The fountain syringe consists of a piece of tubing attached to a bag (similar to a hot water bottle). A rounded plastic nozzle on the end of the tubing is inserted into the vagina. Gravity creates the flow of the solution. The bulb syringe has no tubing; the vaginal tip is attached directly to a small bag or bottle. The fluid is forced out of the bulb by squeezing the device or by the inward pressure exerted by the distended walls of the bulb.

Proper technique is essential for safe douching. The pressure used to instill the solution should be gentle, not forceful. Too much pressure may cause reflux of the solution (and possibly of bacteria) into the uterus and increase the risk of pelvic infection. Correct technique is outlined in Vaginal Douching—What You Need to Know.

#### Other Genital Hygiene Products

Genital towelettes (e.g., Tucks) are premoistened disposable wipes that are generally safe for occasional use. They contain ingredients such as perfumes, astringents, emollients and anti-infectives and can be irritating or cause allergic reactions. Mild soap and warm water are preferred for daily cleansing.

Genital washes (e.g., Summer’s Eve) are liquid cleansers designed for daily use on the external genitalia. They provide no additional benefit over mild soap and water, but there is no significant risk to their use. 

Genital deodorant sprays (e.g., Summer’s Eve FDS) contain ingredients such as perfumes and propellants and are marketed to reduce genital odour. Their use is not recommended. They can mask the odour of infections and cause treatment delays. Their use is associated with a high incidence of irritation and allergic reactions. If used, they must not be applied to the inside of the vagina. 

The use of talcum powder and similar products are also of concern. The International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) classifies talc as possibly carcinogenic to humans. There is limited and mixed evidence available to identify perineal talc use as a risk factor for ovarian cancer but the American and Canadian Cancer Societies caution people about the possible risk of use.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

#### Vaginal Dryness

#### Pathophysiology

It is common to have periods of time when vaginal lubrication is decreased. Low estrogen levels during perimenopause or postmenopause, in the postpartum period, during breastfeeding, and immediately following menses may result in vaginal dryness. Tampons and certain medications can contribute to decreased vaginal lubrication.

Medications associated with decreased vaginal lubrication include:​[^[24]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]



This decreased lubrication may be transient or it may be long term, as is often the case for those who are peri- or postmenopausal.​[^[4]]

Reduced estrogen levels cause thinning of the vaginal tissue, loss of collagen support, increased vaginal pH and reduced production of vaginal lubrication even when sexual arousal has occurred. These changes are associated with a number of vaginal symptoms, including:​[^[24]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The majority of patients seeking advice and relief from vaginal dryness are in peri- or postmenopause. Approximately 15% of perimenopausal and 29–57% of postmenopausal patients experience symptoms of urogenital atrophy, now referred to as Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), including vaginal dryness.​[^[24]] These symptoms can present long after the menopausal transition.​[^[25]] 

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Some relief from vaginal dryness may result from increasing blood flow to the pelvic region through sexual stimulation. Any form of sexual excitement may help restore vaginal moisture. Intercourse is not necessary to achieve this effect and should be avoided if it is painful.​[^[24]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Feminine Care Products: Vaginal Lubricants; Herbal and Natural Health Products: Single Entity.





Prasterone is a vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that has been shown to reduce dyspareunia and vaginal dryness and may therefore be considered in patients with GSM.​[^[33]] A small study suggests that prasterone may be as effective as vaginal estrogen therapy; however, additional studies are required.​[^[34]] 

Ospemifene is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM). In randomized controlled trials, daily oral dosing of 60 mg was associated with decreased dyspareunia, decreased vaginal dryness and an improvement in vaginal pH levels compared with placebo.​[^[35]]

Carbon dioxide laser therapy has also been used cautiously in patients who are unable to use estrogen based products for the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, which includes symptoms of atrophic vaginal changes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials with 270 patients showed no significant difference between response to laser therapy and vaginal estrogen.​[^[43]] Further research is needed but there is some signalling that laser treatment may be an alternative for some patients.

 

#### Natural Health Products

Black cohosh has been used in the management of menopausal symptoms including vaginal dryness, although evidence of efficacy is generally of low quality.​[^[44]]​[^[45]] Black cohosh can cause nausea and headache and is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. The usual dose is 3–6 mL per day of a 1:5 tincture in 60% ethanol, or 500–1000 mg dried root or rhizome 2–3 times daily. Black cohosh should be used with caution in patients already taking estrogen and there is concern about its ability to potentiate the action of antihypertensive drugs.​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]] Hepatotoxicity after the use of black cohosh supplements has been reported, but analysis revealed that authentic black cohosh was not present in the supplement in most cases. It is still unclear whether there is any connection between black cohosh ingestion and liver toxicity but caution is recommended.​[^[48]]

#### Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC)

#### Pathophysiology

The healthy vagina is host to a number of microorganisms including lactobacilli, streptococci, staphylococci, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans (and other *Candida* species), anaerobes and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The types and numbers of organisms vary due to such factors as age, sexual history, contraceptive method, pregnancy, menstruation, antibiotic use, vaginal trauma (e.g., surgery), and tampon and panty liner use.​[^[13]]​[^[3]]​[^[31]]​[^[49]]

Normally, the organisms live in balance in the vaginal environment without adverse effects. When this harmony is disrupted, overproduction of host organisms or colonization by acquired pathogens can occur. These changes set the stage for the development of vaginitis.​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]]

Vaginitis describes a group of conditions that have similar symptoms but a variety of causes (see Table 1).​[^[50]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]] Treatment for vaginitis is specific to the cause, so the correct diagnosis is important. After bacterial vaginosis, *Candida* is the second most common cause of vaginitis. Self-treatment is recommended for candidiasis and for mild-moderate atrophic vaginitis only (see Sexually Transmitted Infections).

| Cause | Common Symptoms | Vaginal pH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) | Severe pruritus of vulva and vaginal areas Stinging/burning“Cottage cheese” discharge | <4.5 |
| Atrophy | Vaginal discharge SpottingSoreness, burningDyspareunia | 7 |
| Bacterial vaginosis​[a] | “Fishy” odour Creamy discharge (yellow/grey) | 5–6 |
| Trichomoniasis | Frothy, wet discharge Pruritus possible | ≥6 |


##### Prepubertal vulvovaginitis

Vulvovaginitis is a common gynecological issue for prepubertal patients. About 62% of pediatric gynecological problems seen in primary care are vulvovaginal symptoms such as vulvovaginal discharge, itching, redness, burning and irritation.​[^[55]] Predisposition to vulvovaginitis is due to the close proximity of the rectum and vagina; thin vulvar skin; lack of labial fat pads and pubic hair; atrophic, anoestrogenic vaginal mucosa; and issues related to hygiene and body exploration. Bacterial infections can also occasionally occur. VVC is uncommon.​[^[55]]

#### Goals of Therapy for VVC



#### Patient Assessment

The decision to recommend treatment for VVC must be made with care. Other forms of vaginitis or sexually transmitted diseases (which can have similar symptoms)​[^[56]] and allergic or adverse reactions must be ruled out. 

Further evaluation may be required if the patient:​[^[50]]​[^[51]]​[^[54]]​[^[56]]



Potential predisposing factors for VVC include:​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[54]]



Patients who have symptoms of VVC and have had a previous diagnosis of candidiasis may be candidates for self-treatment. An assessment approach is outlined in Figure 2.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Although there is no specific nonpharmacologic therapy for VVC, preventive measures such as clothing and dietary modifications may be worth trying in recurrent, resistant cases and generally do not cause adverse outcomes.​[^[50]]​[^[54]]



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

After the patient has been assessed to verify the likelihood of VVC, self-treatment can be considered. Table 3 outlines treatment options for uncomplicated VVC.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Feminine Care Products: Anti-infectives for Vaginal Fungal Infections.

Patient preference will play a significant role in the final choice of therapy.



Providing directions to ensure correct use and adherence with the chosen regimen is important. The intravaginal product is usually administered at bedtime to increase contact time with vaginal tissue and should be continued through menses if it commences during therapy. The complete course of treatment should be used even if symptoms resolve before completion of the doses. If vulvar symptoms are significant, a topical antifungal can be used adjunctively.

Vaginal use of azoles during pregnancy is not associated with risk of malformations or with spontaneous abortions.​[^[64]]​[^[65]] Oral use of fluconazole has been associated with spontaneous abortion​[^[66]] but not malformations​[^[67]] or stillbirths.​[^[68]] Fluconazole is not recommended for pregnant patients and should only be used if a healthcare provider determines that the benefits outweigh the risks.​[^[66]] Fluconazole may also be used in those who are breastfeeding, as amounts transferred into breast milk result in lower exposure than with neonatal fluconazole doses.​[^[69]]

Further examination and evaluation may be required for persistent or recurrent cases of vaginal candidiasis or for patients with a greater tendency to develop candidiasis, e.g., immunocompromised patients. Therapy options include switching to an alternative vaginal antifungal agent or longer courses of therapy (6, 7 or 14 days).​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[54]]​[^[70]]

Generally, sexual partners are not treated for candidal infection; however, a minority of patients may experience balanitis, characterized by discoloured areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction with pruritus or irritation and therefore may benefit from treatment with topical azole (twice daily for 7 days) to relieve symptoms.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] 

For more information on pharmacologic management of VVC, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Sexually Transmitted Infections.

#### Prophylaxis of VVC

Prophylactic therapy is sometimes prescribed for patients with recurrent candidiasis. Single-dose daily or weekly treatments of oral or topical therapy can help reduce recurrence of candidiasis. Resistance is a concern with prophylactic azole treatment, so it should be used only in those with a persistent problem and under the supervision of an appropriate health-care practitioner. Dosing information for recurrent infections can be found in Table 3.

#### Prevention of Resistance

Reports of azole-resistant candidiasis are of concern.​[^[50]]​[^[54]]​[^[56]]​[^[62]] Self-treatment of vaginal infections is among the speculated, yet unproven, causes; misdiagnosis and inappropriate or incomplete courses of therapy may also be contributing to this resistance. Although not substantiated, it is a reminder that the correct diagnosis and appropriate product use is important for proper self-treatment with vaginal antifungals. Candida glabrata is one of the organisms found in resistant cases. C. glabrata tends to be found in older patients who have used azole therapy and who have a complicating underlying illness such as diabetes.​[^[71]] Those with recurrent symptoms of vaginitis should be further evaluated.​[^[54]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Ensure the patient understands that symptoms should resolve within 7 days of the start of treatment, no matter which regimen is used. The patient should also know what to do in case of adverse effects or unsuccessful treatment (see Table 2).

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vulvovaginal itching and burning, dyspareunia, discharge | Patient: daily for 7–10 daysHealth-care practitioner: after 7 days or next visit | Eradication of symptoms | If symptoms still present 1 wk after start of therapy, patient requires further evaluation and therapy. |
| Increased irritation (may indicate adverse reaction to product or inappropriate therapy) | As above | As above | Increased severity of symptom(s) should be assessed promptly; discontinue therapy and ensure patient receives further evaluation. |


#### Toxic Shock Syndrome

#### Pathophysiology

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe, life-threatening condition resulting from toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Group A Strep (Streptococcus pyogenes).​[^[77]] Menstrual TSS became a significant concern with the introduction of hyperabsorbable tampons in the late 1970s, which acted as a reservoir for these microorganisms. Since the removal of these products from the market, the rate of TSS has decreased but it still poses a risk to some. The prevalence of menstrual TSS is 0.8–3.4 per 100 000 patients of menstrual age per year.​[^[77]] It primarily affects younger individuals (15–25 years of age) who use tampons during menses. Studies have demonstrated that many individuals have antibodies that protect them from experiencing a reaction to the toxin-producing bacteria; however, others have little innate protection.​[^[78]]

Tampon use is a major risk factor for the development of menstrual TSS. Other risk factors include the use of diaphragms, cervical caps, menstrual cups and contraceptive sponges.​[^[79]]​[^[80]]

Toxic shock syndrome can evolve clinically in rapid fashion, with a healthy person becoming very ill in less than 12 hours. 

Criteria for diagnosis include:​[^[79]]​[^[81]]



If left untreated, TSS can be fatal.

The role of the health-care practitioner is to:



#### Patient Assessment

If a young patient presents with symptoms including fever, rash, vomiting, profuse diarrhea, dizziness and/or faintness, TSS should be among the diagnoses considered. Ask the patient how the onset of illness relates temporally to the menstrual period, whether tampons are used and which contraceptive method is used. If symptoms are consistent with TSS and can be temporally associated with the use of tampons, a diaphragm, cervical cap or contraceptive sponge, the intravaginal product should be removed immediately and the patient should be referred for immediate medical attention. Treatment of TSS includes aggressive fluid replacement and IV antibiotic therapy.​[^[79]]​[^[81]]

#### Prevention

Risk reduction is the key to minimizing the occurrence of TSS that is associated with menstruation and/or contraceptive devices. Advise patients on the proper use of tampons and barrier contraceptives that are associated with an increased risk of TSS (see Toxic Shock Syndrome—What You Need to Know).
