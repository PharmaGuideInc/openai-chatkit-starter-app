#### Introduction

Many drugs are used to treat diseases for which disease prevention strategies and lifestyle management are also recommended; therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for health professionals to use their knowledge, skills and abilities to educate patients on lifestyle modifications to prevent disease. This chapter discusses risk factors for mortality in Canada and various strategies for disease prevention.

#### Risk Factors for Mortality in Canada

Developments in public health as well as increased affluence have changed the leading causes of death in Western countries such as Canada. Infectious diseases are no longer the major cause of death; in 2018, the leading causes for all age groups were primarily chronic conditions, specifically:​[^[1]]



Acute conditions that were the leading causes of death include:



The rank of leading causes of death varies by age group. Accidents (unintentional injuries) were the most-common cause of death in the 1–44 age group, while neoplasms were the most common cause of death in the 45–64 age group. In the 15–34 age group, suicide was the second most common cause of death.​[^[1]] 

Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the risk of chronic diseases; however, much of the variation in the incidence of chronic conditions may be due to modifiable causes. An analysis of the “actual causes of death” (from external, nongenetic causes) found that many chronic conditions are often rooted in lifestyle, dietary and metabolic risk factors, in particular:​[^[2]]



Alcohol use and drug misuse are also important risk factors for road traffic and other injuries.​[^[3]]

Since a small number of preventable behaviours and exposures may explain a large proportion of all deaths, interventions to increase smoking cessation, avoid excess alcohol and drug misuse, control high blood pressure, improve diet, and increase physical activity are high priorities in health care.​[^[2]]

#### Goals of Disease Prevention

The ultimate goals are the prevention of disease and promotion of healthy living. More specifically:



#### Patient Assessment

Gather information on lifestyle behaviours to quantify and document:



A risk-assessment tool to determine the impact of lifestyle behaviours associated with increased longevity has been proposed by Project Big Life. This self-assessment tool provides patients with information regarding their highest risk behaviours and allows them to determine their amount of increased longevity if these behaviours were modified. 

In addition to BMI and waist circumference cut-offs, the waist to height ratio (WHtR) is an easy-to-use tool for self-assessment of obesity-related health risks (see Figure 1), especially in primary care settings.​[^[4]] Although not well known, the WHtR can be used in both children and adolescents​[^[5]] and as a screening tool for cardiometabolic risk in both Asian and non-Asian populations.​[^[6]]

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a chart designed to assess the relationship between height and waist measurement, providing guidance on health risk categories based on these metrics.

### Chart Structure:

- **Axes:**
  - **Y-Axis (Vertical):** Represents "Your Height" in both centimeters and feet/inches, ranging from 100 cm (3'3") to 200 cm (6'7").
  - **X-Axis (Horizontal):** Represents "Your Waist Measurement" in both centimeters and inches, ranging from 40 cm (16 inches) to 130 cm (50 inches).

### Zones:

The chart is divided into four zones labeled A, B, C, and D, each representing different health risk categories based on the ratio of waist circumference to height.

- **Zone A:** 
  - Lightest shade.
  - Labeled "Take Careᵃ".
  - Indicates a lower waist-to-height ratio.

- **Zone B:** 
  - Slightly darker shade.
  - Labeled "OKᵇ".
  - Represents an acceptable waist-to-height ratio.

- **Zone C:** 
  - Darker shade.
  - Labeled "Take Careᶜ".
  - Indicates a higher waist-to-height ratio, suggesting caution.

- **Zone D:** 
  - Darkest shade.
  - Labeled "Take Actionᵈ".
  - Represents the highest waist-to-height ratio, indicating a need for immediate action.

### Additional Information:

- **Guidance:** 
  - A statement at the bottom of the chart advises: "You should keep your waist circumference to less than half your height."

### Visuals:

- **Illustrations:** 
  - On the right side, there are four illustrations corresponding to each zone (A, B, C, D), visually representing the body shape associated with each category.

This chart is a tool for assessing potential health risks based on the waist-to-height ratio, encouraging individuals to maintain a waist circumference less than half their height for optimal health.

A high degree of awareness exists among the Canadian population regarding strategies for disease prevention and lifestyle modifications, and patients are very interested in preventive care.​[^[7]]​[^[8]] Discussions with patients should always include the medical consequences of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and should be delivered in a respectful and nonjudgmental manner. Lifestyle management may be promoted with brief counselling, the addition of a physical activity (PA) recommendation and referral to community resources. Important life events or a new diagnosis of a chronic disease with a prescription for drug therapy may be catalysts, increasing the likelihood that patients themselves identify the need for a lifestyle change. For more information on approaches for health behaviour change, see Facilitating Behaviour Change. 

#### Who Can Benefit from Health Promotion and Disease Prevention?

Surveys from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System show that only 5.1% of people without cardiovascular disease and 7.2% of people with coronary heart disease adhere to the public health promotion recommendations for physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and smoking abstinence.​[^[9]] As a result, most patients will likely benefit from lifestyle modification and disease prevention behaviours. Examples of how patient presentation may suggest possible lifestyle interventions are shown in Table 1.

#### Obesity

#### Introduction

Obesity is defined by the WHO as a BMI >30 measured as kg/(height in m)​[^2].​[^[13]] A BMI of 40–45 kg/m​[^2] is associated with a reduced median survival of 8–10 years, comparable to the effects of smoking.​[^[14]] However, the use of BMI to assess obesity does not apply to people over 65 years of age or to conditioned athletes.​[^[15]]

Visceral adiposity may be a better indicator of increased risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.​[^[16]] Patients at high risk have a waist measurement of >40 inches (102 cm) for males and >35 inches (88 cm) for females. Waist circumference cut-offs for South Asian, Chinese and Japanese individuals are lower (>35.5 inches or 90 cm for males and >31.5 inches or 80 cm for females).

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Canada as well as globally; over 2 billion adults worldwide are considered overweight.​[^[13]] Epidemic rates of obesity are found in both developed and developing countries; it is a chronic condition with serious social and psychological dimensions, affecting Canadians of all ages and socioeconomic groups. A 2017 survey revealed that approximately 34% of the Canadian population is overweight and 27% have obesity.​[^[17]] The obesity rate in children has also risen significantly: the prevalence of obesity in children 6–17 years of age is 8.6%, using International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definitions.​[^[18]] This is important since complications, both physical and psychological, and comorbidities of obesity may begin during childhood.

Having excess weight or obesity increases the risk of chronic disease and health conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder and liver disease, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Despite maintaining metabolic parameters with the normal range, obesity remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.​[^[19]] Less well known is that obesity is associated with cancers such as colon cancer and those that are hormonally related, particularly prostate, endometrial and breast cancers.​[^[13]]​[^[17]] Furthermore, obesity is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality.​[^[17]]Further discussion of obesity and treatment options can be found in Obesity.

#### Weight Control and Nutrition for Disease Prevention

As the worldwide prevalence of excess weight and obesity increases, effective strategies are needed to help individuals manage their weight. All structured, calorie-restricted diets result in comparable and significant weight loss in adherent patients, irrespective of macronutrient composition. In order to sustain weight loss, continued adherence is essential, with interventions lasting 48 months showing a 3–6 kg weight loss maintenance.​[^[20]]

A multimodal approach, including dietary therapy, physical activity and behavioural therapy, is essential for weight control.​[^[17]]​[^[21]]  Further discussion of options for weight control can be found in Obesity.





Ultra-processed food is a formulation of primarily cheap industrial sources of dietary energy and nutrients plus additives, using a series of processes (hence “ultra-processed”). It is energy-dense; high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt; and is a poor source of protein, dietary fibre and micronutrients.​[^[23]] Preliminary evidence suggests that the intake of ultra-processed food contributes to excess calories (average of 500 kcal/day) and may contribute to the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes.​[^[24]]​[^[27]] It has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[28]]

The Mediterranean diet is high in legumes, minimally processed whole grain products, fruits, vegetables, and nuts and fish and low in red and processed meat and dairy products. Olive oil is the major source of lipids. It is likely that the eating pattern as a whole contributes to the health-promoting effects of the Mediterranean diet.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] This diet has been shown to improve mortality and morbidity in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, even if no weight loss occurs.​[^[31]]​[^[32]] For prevention of disease, higher adherence to all aspects of the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease or mortality, cancer incidence or mortality, and neurodegenerative diseases.​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[33]]

A plant-based diet (vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns) is also considered a suitable dietary pattern for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.​[^[11]] It has been shown to be associated with lower risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.​[^[34]]

For further discussion of special diets and their role in disease prevention and management see Special Diets.

#### Physical Inactivity

#### Introduction

Eighty percent of adults are not active enough to meet Canada’s physical activity recommendations (see Table 2), a figure much lower than estimated using self-reported surveys.​[^[35]] A large proportion of children are considered sedentary.

An increased risk for the development of various chronic conditions and premature mortality has been associated with high levels of sedentary behaviour. The risk appears to be independent of body weight, diet and physical activity. Despite the ability of physical activity to decrease the risk of sedentary behaviours, current recommendations are to avoid sitting for prolonged periods in addition to participating in routine physical activity.​[^[36]] Improved physical fitness levels should be a priority for Canadians of all ages.

#### Physical Activity for Disease Prevention and Management

Evidence supporting a physically active lifestyle to improve health is robust. Routine physical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of at least 20–30% for premature mortality and is an established means of reducing risk for more than 25 chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, all-cancer mortality, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, breast cancer, colon cancer, gestational diabetes, gallstone disease, ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke.​[^[37]] It may also improve mental outlook in patients with chronic illness.​[^[37]] Exercise is also moderately effective for reducing the symptoms of depression,​[^[38]] preventing episodes of depression in the long term​[^[39]] and protecting against cognitive decline.​[^[40]]

 Exercise is beneficial across all ages and levels of mobility, including older participants​[^[41]] and participants with a disability. Being fit in midlife is associated with significantly decreased risk of developing a chronic illness in later life,​[^[42]] and while continuous participation in physical activity from adolescence into midlife is recommended, becoming physically active in midlife may be associated with comparable health benefits.​[^[43]] Most important, the least fit individuals obtain the most benefit from exercise. It has been called the miracle drug,​[^[44]] since regular physical activity prevents disease and promotes health. Furthermore, the reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk provided by moderate exercise compares favourably with interventions for smoking, hypertension and high cholesterol levels. Physical activity is therefore *comparable or superior* to drug interventions on mortality outcomes.​[^[45]] 

Promote regular moderate physical activity to virtually all patients. Populations who may particularly benefit are cancer survivors, the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions. Primary care providers may use prescriptions for exercise, using validated tools. These tools may be accessed at www.exerciseismedicine.org and are safe for healthy adults and those with stable chronic conditions. 



The use of the PAVS plus a referral to community resources has been shown to increase physical activity among primary care patients.​[^[47]]



Patients who have answered no to all of the questions are cleared for physical activity and can exercise at moderate intensity with minimum supervision. If any of the above questions are answered in the positive, refer patient to the follow-up section of the PAR-Q+ questionnaire, where the risk will be further stratified. Most patients with relative contraindications can still exercise, but at lower levels of intensity; the risk of an adverse event related to exercise is very low, even in those living with a chronic condition.​[^[48]] Patients should clearly be told to stop exercising and seek medical attention if they develop chest pain, lightheadedness or palpitations.

Moderate to vigorous aerobic activity is recommended in adults, including older adults, in order to achieve health benefits.​[^[49]] Activity such as brisk walking (defined as 5–6 km/h or 3–4 mph), cycling, yoga, tai chi or noncompetitive swimming are sufficient to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and confer many other benefits; more activity produces more benefits.​[^[37]]​[^[49]] Undertaking structured dance of any genre is equally and occasionally more effective than other types of structured exercise for improving a range of health outcome measures and can be recommended as a safe and effective exercise alternative.​[^[50]] Resistance training or muscle-strengthening exercises are also recommended at least twice weekly for maintaining muscle mass and bone health, and older adults should perform physical activity to maintain balance and prevent falls.​[^[49]] Combining aerobic activities of differing types and intensities, such as housekeeping, leisure and recreational activities, is appropriate. 

 Success should be evaluated according to improvements in chronic disease factors or symptoms and by patients adopting healthy lifestyle habits, not by weight loss alone.​[^[37]] It is important to know that a large volume of physical activity is required for weight loss if there is no concomitant caloric deficit. For weight maintenance, however, regular moderate amounts of intentional physical activity are required. 

Despite little or no weight loss, increased exercise decreases visceral adiposity and decreases mortality.​[^[37]]​[^[42]]​[^[49]] Even 15 minutes/day or 4400 steps/day may increase longevity compared to inactivity.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] Exercise is also beneficial for maintaining flexibility and decreasing health risks in those who are sedentary or who have significant limitations in their ability to exercise.​[^[37]] However, activity of moderate intensity and duration is required to achieve specific health outcomes such as reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Wearable Activity Monitoring (WAM) devices provide an accurate, objective measure of walking and other ambulatory activity; for an average person, 2000 steps is the equivalent of a 1.6-km (1-mile) walk. Most WAM devices provide daily step counting, active minutes and calories burned; however, the intensity of physical activity is not reported in accordance with public health recommendations. Estimates suggest that 7000–8000 steps/day, of which 4000 are of moderate-vigorous intensity in bouts of at least 10 minutes, are in line with guideline recommendations of physical activity for adults (i.e., 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity, in bouts of at least 10 minutes).​[^[53]] Cadence (steps/minute) may be used as a measurement of the intensity of physical activity; a cadence of ≥100 steps/minute may be a reasonable target for adults.​[^[54]] 

Children are also encouraged to participate in moderate to intensive physical activity every day and to minimize sedentary behaviours such as screen time and time spent in sedentary transport.​[^[49]]

Pregnant women should engage in low to moderate physical activity to decrease risks of pregnancy-related conditions such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and newborn macrosomia, even in those who have not previously engaged in physical activity.​[^[55]]

Current recommendations for physical activity are summarized in Table 2.

| Age | Recommendation for Physical Activity |
| --- | --- |
| <1 y | Various forms of physical activity, mostly floor-based play.If not yet mobile, at least 30 min of tummy time spread across the day.Not being restrained for more than 1 h at a time (e.g., stroller, swing).No screen time. |
| 1–2 y | At least 180 min/day of physical activity of various forms spread throughout the day.Not being restrained for more than 1 h at a time (e.g., stroller, swing).No sedentary screen time for children <2 y. No more than 1 h of sedentary screen time for 2-year-old children. |
| 3–4 y | At least 180 min/day of physical activity of various forms spread throughout the day, of which at least 60 min are energetic play.Not being restrained for more than 1 h at a time (e.g., stroller, car seat).No more than 1 h/day of sedentary screen time. |
| 5–17 y | At least 60 min/day of moderate to vigorous activity. Vigorous activities and bone and muscle strengthening should be incorporated at least 3 times/wk.No more than 2 h/day of recreational screen time. |
| 18–64 y | At least 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous activity in bouts of at least 10 min.Muscle and bone strengthening activities at least 2 times/wk. |
| ≥65 y | At least 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous activity in bouts of at least 10 min.Muscle and bone strengthening activities at least 2 times/wk.Physical activities to enhance balance and prevent falls, especially for those with limited mobility. |




For patients with chronic conditions, increased physical activity may be recommended and can be largely self-actioned by a patient (e.g., for falls prevention). Referral to a health-care professional with expertise in exercise prescription (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation, exercise for chronic back pain or knee osteoarthritis, and pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD) tailored to the patient and the specific condition has been shown to be beneficial.​[^[12]]

#### Alcohol Use

#### Introduction

Alcohol consumption demonstrates a J-shaped curve: a lower risk of death in people who are light to moderate drinkers compared with lifetime abstainers and heavy drinkers.​[^[56]] Low to moderate doses of alcohol are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, CVD and heart disease mortality in both men and women compared with lifetime abstainers.​[^[56]] While cardiovascular benefits can be obtained from as little as 1 standard drink (13.6 g alcohol or 45 mL spirits, 150 mL table wine, 360 mL beer) every 2 days, no one should begin drinking alcohol or drink more often because of potential health benefits, as there is high uncertainty regarding these benefits.​[^[59]] Of note, based on observational trials, health benefits from alcohol consumption are seen only from middle age and onward.​[^[59]] In addition, the total caloric intake may increase with alcohol consumption without a commensurate increase in nutritional benefit.

Heavy or binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cancer-specific mortality.​[^[56]] Alcohol-attributable cancers contribute significantly to the overall cancer burden.​[^[56]] In men, alcohol consumption is associated in a dose-dependent manner with cancers of the upper airway and esophagus, which also account for the majority of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths.​[^[56]] Breast cancer accounts for the majority of alcohol-attributable female cancer deaths.​[^[56]] Additional cancers associated with alcohol include liver and colorectal cancer.​[^[57]] Alcohol consumption in persons who smoke increases the rates of cancers more than the independent effect of either smoking or drinking alone.​[^[58]] Doses greater than 50 g/day or 4 standard drinks were significantly associated with the risk of developing cancer at various sites. 

Risk of injury from motor and nonmotor vehicle accidents rises with increasing ingestion of alcohol.​[^[59]] Sporadic drinking of 5 or more drinks in a single day leads to worse long-term health outcomes than the same amount spread evenly over several days.​[^[59]] Women are at increased risk of harm from both chronic and acute ingestion of alcohol for a given consumption level. Differences in women’s physiology (lower body weight, less volume of distribution and smaller livers) may be responsible for this. Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).​[^[60]]

#### Alcohol Reduction

Encourage low-risk drinking for patients who drink alcohol, and in particular those who are receiving drugs known to have potentiating effects with alcohol. Patients who abstain from alcohol should not be encouraged to start drinking for its cardiovascular benefits, as there are other options and they may have a reason for abstinence.​[^[59]] Inform all pregnant women of the risks of alcohol consumption and FASD. Emphasize abstinence in this population.​[^[59]] Consult the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada’s website for more information.

#### Smoking

#### Introduction

Smoking is the greatest known cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality and contributes directly or indirectly to 18.4% of all deaths in Canada.​[^[61]] 

Second-hand smoke is associated with an increased risk of respiratory and heart disease with regular exposure and is estimated to have been responsible for the death of 993 Canadians in 2012.​[^[61]] Although overall smoking rates in the decade prior to 2012 have decreased to 16.2% in people 15 years of age and older, this represents a hard-to-reach group.​[^[61]] Consumption of other tobacco products such as vaping has increased, especially among youth.​[^[62]] In 2019, surveys showed that the percentage of high school students who have ever tried a vaping product had nearly doubled since the previous 2017 surveys.​[^[62]] Most high school students who have used a vaping product in the past 30 days have done so frequently (40% reported daily or almost daily use). The percentage of high school students who had ever tried both cigarettes and e-cigarettes has also significantly increased ​[^[62]] 

In 2019, an outbreak of acute lung injury associated with the use of vaping products was reported in the U.S., with 2711 hospitalized patients and 60 deaths confirmed.​[^[63]] Seventeen cases were reported in Canada; no deaths were reported. This outbreak reached a peak in September 2019 and starting declining thereafter.​[^[64]] Although vitamin E acetate—often used as an additive to THC-containing vaping products—is strongly linked to acute lung injury, evidence is insufficient to dismiss the contribution of other chemicals.​[^[63]]

Most recreational cannabis is smoked; 9.5% of Canadians aged 15 and older (2.8 million) used cannabis in the previous year for nonmedical purposes exclusively.​[^[65]]​[^[66]] Cannabis smoking is also associated with daily cigarette smoking​[^[66]] and is linked to increased rates of respiratory infection, pneumonia and chronic bronchitis (see Cannabis).

Of note, compared with the rest of the world, Canada has among the highest drug-attributable DALYs (disability adjusted life years, that is lost years of “healthy” life), primarily due to cannabis use.​[^[66]] 

#### Tobacco Cessation

Ask for the smoking status of patients and document this in the patient’s profile. A recommendation from a health-care practitioner is one of the most important ways of influencing a patient to consider quitting.​[^[67]]​[^[68]]​[^[69]] Since it is estimated that most smokers start smoking as teenagers,​[^[61]] strategies to prevent smoking are as important as getting patients to quit. For more information, see Smoking Cessation.

Health-care practitioners can also raise awareness on the risks associated with vaping products. Advise patients who are using vaping products to avoid acquiring products from illegal or unregulated sources, adding substances not intended by the manufacturers, or using THC-containing vaping products to avoid the risk of a vaping product–related lung illness.​[^[64]]

#### Influenza and Pneumonia

#### Introduction

Influenza and pneumonia cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic medical conditions, particularly in the elderly (see ).​[^[70]]​[^[71]]​[^[72]] Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing or attenuating influenza, yet only 32% of Canadian adults 18–64 years of age with a chronic medical condition received the influenza vaccine in 2013–2014.​[^[71]] Vaccination rates of noninstitutionalized seniors are greater at 64% but these rates fall short of the national target of 80%.​[^[71]] Emerging research suggests influenza vaccination may provide indirect protection to others in the household or community.​[^[73]]

Invasive pneumococcal disease is a serious illness that affects the very young, the elderly, and individuals with immunosuppression or other chronic conditions.​[^[74]] 

#### Immunization

Encourage influenza vaccination in those >65 years of age or those at high risk. Refer to the Canadian guidelines for immunization by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)​[^[74]] for further recommendations on influenza vaccinations for infants and children. All healthy adults over the age of 65 years should receive 1 dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unless there are contraindications. Immunocompetent adults <65 years of age in long-term care facilities, those with a history of alcoholism, smokers, illicit drug users and those who are homeless should also receive the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Use of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants appears to confer secondary protection in the elderly, as a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease has been reported in this population.​[^[75]] Review whether the patient is a candidate for other recommended vaccines such as tetanus or zoster.

#### Social Isolation

#### Introduction

Emerging research has found that social isolation is a predictor of mortality comparable to the traditional risk factors of smoking, hypertension, obesity and increased lipids.​[^[76]] In prospective trials, social isolation was associated independently with cardiovascular risk factors such as cardiovascular heart disease and stroke.​[^[77]] The elderly are at particular risk, and perceived social isolation is associated with mental and physical health issues, depression, self-harm, self-neglecting behaviours, cognitive or physical disability, and increased mortality.​[^[78]] 

#### Social Connectedness

Though there is accumulating evidence that social isolation and loneliness have negative health impacts,​[^[76]] the available literature on interventions to improve social connectedness is scarce and mostly targets social isolation in the elderly.​[^[79]]​[^[80]]​[^[81]] Health-care providers, including pharmacists, can help identify individuals who are socially isolated or feel lonely and may also reduce loneliness in the elderly through routine interactions (e.g., medication review or renewal).​[^[82]]​[^[83]] Inform individuals of available community services or programs and encourage their participation in such programs.

Information communication technology is a promising intervention to decrease social isolation in the elderly, but is not suitable for all seniors due to cognitive defects, insufficient eyesight or physical ability.​[^[84]]

#### Vitamin D and Sun Exposure

#### Introduction

Skin cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canada, and the rate of diagnosis is increasing.​[^[85]] The Canadian Cancer Society recommends reduced exposure to the sun, particularly between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the sun’s rays are the strongest. Intermittent, intense sun exposure during childhood or adolescence, along with a history of sunburn, shows the strongest association with risk of melanoma.​[^[57]]

A sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher for most individuals and an SPF of 30 for persons who work outdoors or will be outside for most of the day is recommended. Protection from ultraviolet radiation with hats, sunglasses and clothing that covers most of the skin should be used​[^[85]] (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage). 

Most Canadians, including children and adolescents, have insufficient vitamin D levels​[^[86]]​[^[87]] due to concerns about sun exposure and due to Canada’s northern latitude and indoor lifestyle. Persons with little sun exposure, as well as the elderly and exclusively breastfed babies, may be deficient in vitamin D. Sufficient vitamin D intake through diet alone is impractical; therefore, oral supplementation of vitamin D may be required. 

The effects of vitamin D on bone health are well established, but convincing evidence for the use of vitamin D supplementation to reduce risk of falls and fractures is inadequate.​[^[88]] 

The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada recommends sufficient vitamin D to decrease the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), especially in at-risk populations, and to help prevent MS from getting worse.​[^[89]] However, further evidence to support Vitamin D as a standard for treatment is lacking.​[^[90]]

Observational studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with different disease states (e.g., cardiovascular, infectious, autoimmune, metabolic disease) as well as increased mortality;​[^[90]] however, causality has not been established. Evidence suggests no effect of vitamin D supplementation on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality and a small possible effect on cancer mortality.​[^[92]]​[^[93]]

#### Vitamin D Supplementation

The optimal dietary requirement for vitamin D in healthy adults is currently evolving. Vitamin D is naturally present in very few foods, mainly fatty fish and egg yolks. The major sources of vitamin D in Canada are fortified foods such as cow’s milk, soy beverages and calcium-fortified orange juice.​[^[22]] Endogenous vitamin D is produced in the skin with exposure to ultraviolet light but virtually none is produced during the winter months in Canada. To improve bone health, the recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamin D are 600 units (15 mcg) for men and women 1–70 years of age and 800 units (20 mcg) for those older than 70 years of age.​[^[91]] In Canada, exclusively breastfed infants <1 year of age should receive 400 units of vitamin D per day. Without adequate sun exposure, children and adults may require approximately 800–1000 units per day.​[^[91]] Skin exposure of arms and legs for 5–30 minutes between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. twice weekly is sufficient for vitamin D synthesis. However, because of the risks of ultraviolet radiation, a balanced diet, supplementation and limited skin exposure are the preferred methods of obtaining vitamin D. See Nutritional Supplements for more information.

#### Strategies to Improve Lifestyle Management and Disease Prevention

| Disease Prevention Strategy | Recommendations | Expected Benefits | Onset of Benefits | Cautions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physical activity​[49]​[51]​[94]​[95]​[96] | At least 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity in bursts of 10 min or more:Moderate activity: brisk walking (6 km/h), skating, bike riding.

Person cannot speak in full sentences without taking a breath 45–60 min/day of intentional physical activity is preferableResistance or strength training twice weekly:Push-ups, sit-ups, lifting weights, climbing stairs, digging in the gardenBone strengthening (walking, running, yoga, dance)Children and adolescents should engage in at least 60 min/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity at least 5 times weekly.Pregnant women should engage in 150 min/wk of low to moderate physical activity.Limit or avoid prolonged sitting. | Reduced all-cause mortality.Reduced risk of developing type 2 DM, HTN, CHD.Reduced risk of stroke, obesity, breast cancer, colon cancer.Reduced stress.Improved energy, mental outlook, balance, sleep. Improved recovery from cancer; less adverse effects.Improved weight control.Prevention of falls.Prevention of cognitive decline and improved cognition in AD.Slowed progression of osteoporosis.Treatment of chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis of hip and knee. | 10 y for reduced all-cause mortality.3–4 wk for lipid values.4–6 wk for mental outlook and mild depression.Benefits lost if exercise not continued; cannot be “stored up.” | Patients should self-assess exercise risks based on their health conditions using the PAR-Q+​[48] (see Resources). | Emphasize the harm of sedentary behaviours.Discourage vigorous exercise in otherwise sedentary adults.Suggest gardening, walking, cleaning house, recreational activities, using stairs instead of elevator.Structured dance is also beneficial.​[50]Walking suggested for most, as cost is low and no training required.Indoor walking or treadmills are options if weather poor.Encourage use of pedometer.10-min sessions accumulated throughout the day are as effective as a single 30-min session.Additional health benefits seen with moderate to vigorous activity for >150 min/wk.Total energy expenditure is most important. |
| Weight management​[97]​[98]​[99]​[100]​[101]​[102] | Diet high in fruits, vegetables (5–10 servings/day), fibre, whole grains; rich in omega-3 fatty acids; and that contains protein sources that are low in trans-fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Sodium intake of ≤1500 mg/day (approximately 1 tsp of table salt) is also recommended.Caloric intake matched to energy expenditure.Mediterranean diet associated with increased longevity, independent of weight.​[31]​[33]Limit ultra-processed foods.​[24]Emphasize a plant-based diet.​[22]Limit sugar-sweetened beverages.Foods high in polyphenols (e.g., green/black tea, cocoa/dark chocolate) may be beneficial.Moderate coffee consumption (3–4 cups/day) is associated with reduced risk of death.​[103] Caution in the elderly, persons with hypertension and children.PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events; little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality.​[104] | Reduced risk of premature mortality, stroke, cancers (colon, esophageal).Reduced risk of developing CHD, type 2 DM. | 2 y for reduced premature mortality.​[106]3–4 wk for lipid values.1–5 y for CHD, DM, stroke. | Clinical nutritionist or other professional with specialized nutritional expertise for patients with DM, dyslipidemia and CHD, morbid obesity. Patients with unstable medical or mental illnesses should be temporarily excluded from weight-loss programs.Unintentional weight loss should be referred to a physician.Evidence for weight loss in those >60 y without obesity-related factors is lacking.Weight stability is important. | Healthy nutrition, exercise and weight control are key. Weight loss indicated if BMI >30 and comorbidity (DM, HTN, sleep apnea) or abdominal obesity as measured by waist circumference.Self assessment of health risks may be accomplished using the Ashwell Shape Chart (see Figure 1).​[4]Encourage daily breakfast, weekly weighing and limiting fast food intake.Increasing PUFA probably slightly increases weight. |
| Smoking cessation | Abstinence. | Reduced risk of cancer (including breast cancer), CVD (including stroke), lung diseases, osteoporosis. | 10-y abstinence results in risk reduction of cancer similar to that of nonsmokers.3 y for risk reduction of CVD.6 months for improvement in respiratory symptoms. | None. | Address concern for increase in weight, as absolute risk of smoking is greater than absolute risk of obesity.Discuss benefits and risks of smoking cessation drugs. |
| Alcohol reduction/abstinence​[58]​[60] | Low to moderate alcohol consumption (≤9 standard drinks/wk for females or ≤14 standard drinks/wk for males).Abstinence if pregnant.Abstinence if driving a motor vehicle or boat. | Reduced risk of CVD achieved with consumption of approximately 1 drink every other day. | 5–10 y for benefit of CVD in patients >45 y. Younger patients unlikely to benefit. | Consumption outside low-risk guidelines associated with:Increased risk of cancer (esophageal, liver, mouth, pharynx, larynx)Increased risk of hypertensionImpaired social functioningConsult appropriate health-care practitioner if problem drinking identified. | Alcohol can potentiate postprandial triglyceridemia; excessive alcohol intake combined with high carbohydrate intake can induce hypertriglyceridemia.Abstinence in patients with atrial fibrillation may reduce the recurrence of arrhythmia.​[105] |
| Influenza/pneumonia vaccination​[74] | Influenza vaccination for:Adults ≥65 y Adults <65 y at high risk of influenza-related complications, their household contacts, health-care workers, and all those wishing to be protected against influenzaImmunosuppressionIndividuals with HIVPneumococcal vaccination for:Adults ≥65 yAdults <65 y at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, i.e., those with asplenia, sickle cell disease, cirrhosis, alcoholism | Reduced mortality due to influenza or pneumonia.Reduced risk of hospitalization due to these diseases in patients >65 y. | 2 wk; influenza vaccination required yearly.2- to 3-wk onset for >10 y protection with pneumococcal vaccination. | Address concerns regarding common vaccination myths. | Pneumococcal vaccination usually given only once. |
| Social connectedness | Group activities, skill courses, one-on-one interventions as well as other intervention types (e.g., inter-generational activities, internet support groups).​[79]​[80] | Improved social network, social participation and support, sense of belonging.​[79]No clear relationship between effects on social isolation and overall health.​[81] | Data are unavailable. | Most studies did not report harms of the interventions.Cost of some programs/interventions may be a barrier.​[81] | Involve individual in the decision-making process when choosing a program/intervention.​[80]Programs that target and connect at-risk groups (e.g., immigrants, LGBT individuals, low-income individuals) may be especially effective.​[80]Physical activity interventions may be associated with better effects.​[81] More good-quality studies are needed. |
| Sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation​[87]​[88]​[107] | 1000 units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) for adults during the fall and winter months.​[108] Children and infants should receive 400 units/day with sensible skin exposure. Patients with inadequate skin exposure due to religious or cultural dress, dark skin, lifestyle, malabsorption syndromes, obesity and chronic kidney disease are at higher risk. | Improved bone health and muscle strength. | 1 y or longer for fracture risk reduction and bone health.3–4 wk for correction of insufficiency. | Avoid excessive sun exposure, particularly sunburns. Vitamin D likely safe at total intake of ≤2000 units/day. Patients with chronic granulomatous disorders (TB, sarcoidosis, some lymphomas) should be referred for assessment by appropriate health-care practitioner. Doses >50 000 units/day are associated with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. | Vitamin D toxicity does not occur with sun exposure, but risk of skin cancer increased with exposure. Sensible skin exposure of 5–30 min, depending on skin type, of arms and legs at half minimal erythema dose​[a] can provide 400 units of vitamin D.Exposure to 1 minimal erythema dose (with exposed arms and legs) during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. can provide the equivalent of 10 000 units of vitamin D. |


#### Monitoring the Patient for Lifestyle Changes

Self-monitoring is as important for lifestyle change as it is for any chronic condition. Table 4 provides a framework that requires individualization. Provide reinforcement with written or technology-based plans and logs for self-monitoring, as this has been found to be useful, especially for nutrition and exercise recommendations.​[^[37]]

Lapses are common, and long-term behaviour change may require ongoing support from family members, the pharmacist as a health coach, other health-care providers or other motivational sources. Ensure the patient has a plan for ensuring a lapse does not evolve into a relapse. Encourage patients to reassess how confident they feel that they can change, and the importance of how physical activity and other health behaviours can motivate change.​[^[109]]

| Lifestyle Change | Monitoring | End Point | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weight loss and nutrition | Patient: weight weekly while on diet, fit of clothing, increased mobility, reduced drug requirements Health-care practitioner: after 3–6 months | Decrease of 5–10% of body weight over 6 months. | If ineffective, consider referral to a formal weight management program and/or dietitian.If effective, moderately vigorous exercise recommended to prevent weight regain. |
| Physical activity | Patient: daily using activity logs/electronic methods and pedometers; increased stamina, flexibility and energy Health-care practitioner: after 8–12 wk | 2.5 h/wk moderate intensity: walking at 6 km/h or 4 mph pace spread out into sessions of 10 min or more. Muscle strengthening exercises twice weekly such as climbing stairs, lifting weights or yoga. | Start with 10 min/day, slowly increasing by 10 min every 8–10 wk in elderly or sedentary patients. If walking, set goals using a pedometer of an increase of 2000–3000 steps/day over baseline; aim for 8000–10 000 steps/day if no functional limitations; lower amounts in elderly or very sedentary patients.If ineffective, refer to other community resources. |
| Smoking cessation | See Smoking Cessation |  |  |
| Alcohol reduction | Patient: weekly intake Health-care practitioner: after 3–6 months | Alcohol intake within low-risk guidelines. | If ineffective, counsel to stage of change (see Facilitating Behaviour Change). If problem drinking (impaired social functioning), refer for further assessment and treatment. |
| Social connectedness | Patient: weekly participation in programs/interventionsHealth-care practitioner: after 3–6 months​[110] | Increased feeling of belonging, social support and network, and social participation. | Help patient identify potential community services or programs that could be of interest.​[80]Involve patient in the decision-making process when choosing a program/intervention.​[80] |
| Sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation | Patient: daily intake; limit exposure to sun during peak hours in summer Health-care practitioner: after 3–6 months | No sunburn or excessive exposure. | Supplementation with vitamin D during winter months is suggested for patients >50 y. |
| Influenza/pneumococcal vaccination | Patient: in the fall for influenza via pharmacy or clinic; any time for pneumococcalHealth-care practitioner: in the fall for influenza; any time for pneumococcal | Yearly immunization with influenza vaccine; once with pneumococcal vaccine. | If ineffective, record in patient profile for recommendation the following year.Assess and address reasons for nonvaccination; counsel to stage of change. |


#### Technology-Based Monitoring Tools

Smartphone applications available include specific features like self-monitoring, education, feedback reports, social media support, nutritional management, behavioural change programs, physical activity and calorie counting management, goal setting, and motivational strategies. These have been found to be effective in lifestyle management, especially for physical activity and weight management.​[^[111]] Digital tools for hypertension and for overall lifestyle management are also available.​[^[113]] Health apps have great potential in health promotion.​[^[112]] Pharmacists are ideally placed to promote them, to make patients more aware of them, and to use them as part of the monitoring and coaching for health behaviour change of patients. Examples of evidence-based monitoring tools/smartphone applications include MyFitnessPal and Lose It!

It is important to note that technology-based monitoring tools do not by themselves automatically translate into behaviour change and that software platforms may not process data in a clinically meaningful way to be integrated into medication monitoring and recommendations.​[^[114]] Therefore, health coaching and brief interventions by the pharmacist or health-care provider is still required.

Goal setting with written or technology-based plans utilizing WAM devices and logs for self-monitoring should be provided, as this has been found to be useful, especially for nutrition and exercise recommendations.

If pharmacists can be supported to offer public health services more proactively, it is likely that increased exposure to health promotion and lifestyle management will have a positive effect on the attitude and health of the general public. Pharmacists should therefore endeavor to promote lifestyle management to all their patients who seek advice and to advocate for these interventions within their professional environment.​[^[115]]​[^[116]]
