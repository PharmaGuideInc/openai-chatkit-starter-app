CPhA acknowledges the contribution of Dr. C. Douglas Smith as the previous author of this chapter.CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women” and “men” as well as “female” and “male” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystemic autoimmune disease affecting 1 in 1000–2000 individuals of any age, but predominantly young women in their reproductive years. SLE is best viewed as a spectrum of disease manifestations. Some individuals have mild clinically stable disease with predominant involvement of the skin and/or joints, while others have more severe systemic disease with potentially life-threatening end-organ damage. SLE is also associated with significant increased risk of comorbidities (e.g., CVD, infections, osteoporosis). CVD and infections have high impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.

While the precise etiology is unknown, loss of immunologic tolerance to nuclear antigens and the development of antibodies directed against self are key features of the disease.​[^[1]] These *autoantibodies* (produced by B cells and other immune cells) play a major role in the widely variable manifestations of the disease.​[^[2]] See Table 1 for examples of autoantibodies seen in SLE.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Antibody​[a] | Prevalence | Clinical Comment |
| Antinuclear (ANA) | 95% | Highly sensitive but low specificity; also present in Sjögren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and infectious mononucleosis |
| Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) | 70–98% | Highly specific; linked to disease activity, kidney involvement, serositis and hematological manifestations. Used to monitor clinical course |
| Anti-Smith protein (anti-Sm) | 20–40% | Highly specific for SLE but low sensitivity |
| Antiphospholipid (cardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein) | 30–40% | May be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome​[b] |
| Anti-Sjögren syndrome antigen type A, also called anti-Ro (anti-SSA/Ro) | 30% | Linked to photosensitive rashes, dry eyes and neonatal congenital heart block. Strong association (90%) with neonatal lupus erythematosus |
| Anti-Sjögren syndrome antigen type B, also called Lupus La protein (anti-SSB/La) | 10% | Linked to photosensitive rashes, dry eyes and neonatal complications. Strong association (90%) with neonatal lupus erythematosus |


 SLE has a fluctuating clinical course marked by relapses and remissions. The variable presentation and impact on multiple organ systems can make the diagnosis a challenge. There are no diagnostic criteria for SLE but clinicians will often use classification criteria as a guide. There is no single test or symptom that can diagnose SLE and therefore the clinician must use a combination of typical symptoms, abnormal laboratory tests, biopsy results and the presence of auto-antibodies to help confirm SLE as the most likely diagnosis.

#### Therapeutic Choices

For an approach to the treatment of SLE, see Figure 2.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

For drugs used in the treatment of SLE, see Table 2.

#### Topical Therapies

Rashes (occurring in 70% of patients) may be treated locally with topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) may be an effective alternative to corticosteroids.​[^[6]] For more information on these agents, see Atopic Dermatitis. More refractory skin disease may require systemic therapy, most often with antimalarial drugs.

#### Systemic Therapies

NSAIDs are often used to treat joint pain (arthritis occurs in 80% of patients) as well as pleuritic chest pain in patients with pleuritis or pericarditis (about 50% of patients). High doses of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen and sulindac) have been associated with the development of aseptic meningitis in some patients with SLE.​[^[7]] All NSAIDs demonstrate an increased risk of cardiovascular events, e.g., myocardial infarction or stroke.​[^[8]] Patients with a history of cardiovascular or renal disease require careful monitoring while using NSAIDs. The risk of a myocardial infarction is likely greatest at high doses and during the initial treatment phase, i.e., during the first month of treatment.​[^[9]] For more information about NSAIDs, see Osteoarthritis.

Low-dose ASA may be used to reduce the risk of MI and stroke and may be used to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies​[^[10]] (see Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period).

#### Antimalarials

Hydroxychloroquine is considered baseline therapy for the majority of patients with SLE.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Chloroquine carries a greater risk of retinal toxicity and is no longer available in Canada.​[^[11]] Hydroxychloroquine is particularly useful for the most common disease manifestations: arthritis and fatigue. It is often used in combination with other agents, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Early use of antimalarial drugs has been shown to reduce accrual of damage in patients with SLE.​[^[13]] Other relevant benefits ascribed to these agents include lipid- and glucose-lowering effects and reductions in blood clots.​[^[12]] Patients with stable disease should continue therapy long term, as withdrawal of these agents has been associated with disease flares.​[^[14]]​[^[15]]

Patients taking antimalarial drugs require regular ophthalmologic assessment to prevent irreversible retinopathy. In 2016, based on a case-control retrospective study, the American Academy of Ophthalmology revised its recommendation on the maximum daily dose of hydroxychloroquine to ≤5 mg/kg actual weight.​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Risk factors for ophthalmologic toxicity include high-dose therapy, treatment for greater than 5–7 years, liver or kidney disease, advanced age, obesity and pre-existing ophthalmologic disease.​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Patients who are not at high risk require an ophthalmologic assessment at baseline then annually after 5 years of therapy; high-risk patients require an annual assessment without the initial 5-year delay.​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

#### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids by a variety of routes (intraarticular, IM, IV or oral) are generally used for more severe disease.



#### Corticosteroid-Sparing Agents

To reduce corticosteroid-associated adverse effects, corticosteroids are almost always combined with corticosteroid-sparing (“steroid-sparing”) agents, e.g., immunosuppressants, immunomodulators or biologic agents.

Azathioprine is effective in moderate to severe lupus. In severe lupus affecting the kidneys, nervous system or in patients with vasculitis, azathioprine is generally used as maintenance therapy after induction with more potent agents, e.g., cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate.​[^[12]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[23]] 

Cyclophosphamide is generally used as induction therapy where the goal is to minimize damage and induce a state of remission. It is combined with corticosteroids for treatment of severe lupus involving the kidneys or nervous system or in patients with vasculitis. It is usually given IV monthly for 6 doses, or a lower dose is given every 2 weeks for 3 months.​[^[19]]​[^[21]]​[^[23]] Guidelines recommend the low-dose regimen for Caucasian patients with Western or Southern European backgrounds or for patients with mild cases.​[^[12]] In this patient population, the low-dose regimen showed fewer adverse effects and equivalent efficacy compared to the high-dose regimen. Additionally, high-dose cyclophosphamide is associated with permanent infertility.

Leflunomide is occasionally used for refractory arthritis, although evidence is limited.​[^[2]]​[^[22]]

Methotrexate is likely effective and steroid-sparing in patients with refractory arthritis, skin disease, myositis, pleuritis or pericarditis.​[^[24]]

Mycophenolate is as efficacious as cyclophosphamide for induction therapy in proliferative lupus nephritis.​[^[25]] It is preferred to cyclophosphamide in patients who wish to preserve their fertility. Additionally, mycophenolate demonstrated greater efficacy and equivalent safety to azathioprine for maintenance therapy in patients with nephritis.​[^[26]]

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) including tacrolimus and cyclosporine have not been well studied for use of extrarenal SLE manifestations, but are used as treatment of refractory proliferative lupus nephritis for maintenance and to manage severe lupus nephritis with proteinuria.​[^[27]] Cyclosporine has been found to be comparable to azathioprine for maintaining remission following induction therapy.​[^[27]] Tacrolimus has been evaluated for maintenance therapy, alone or as part of “multi-target” therapy (with corticosteroid, mycophenolate and tacrolimus), although studies have been limited to Asian populations.​[^[28]] Tacrolimus is preferable to cyclosporine in terms of adverse effects (e.g., less hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism), but long-term studies and trials in multi-ethic groups are lacking.

Belimumab is the first agent in the class of biologics known as the B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)-specific inhibitors.​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] Belimumab is approved for use in combination with standard therapies to treat mild to moderate active autoantibody-positive SLE.​[^[12]] Belimumab has been shown to be effective in reducing disease activity, improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and in reducing corticosteroid use.​[^[34]] It has also been shown to improve renal efficacy and decrease renal-related death when added to standard of care therapy in patients with lupus nephritis, compared to standard of care alone.​[^[35]] Other biologic response modifiers are being studied but are not currently approved for use in lupus. An example includes targeting B cells with rituximab,​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]] useful in patients with severe refractory hematologic involvement or in refractory nephritis.​[^[38]]

**Anifrolumab** is the second biologic approved for treatment of SLE in Canada. This monoclonal antibody blocks the type 1 interferon alpha receptor on immune cells resulting in decreased interferon pathway activation that is key to the pathogenesis of lupus.​[^[39]] Anifrolumab shows benefit in treating skin rashes and inflammatory arthritis and helps reduce lupus flares and reduce steroid burden.​[^[40]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]] Patients are encouraged to receive their herpes zoster vaccinations prior to starting this biologic due to increase risk of viral infections.

Thalidomide (initial dose 50–100 mg daily, then reduced to the minimum effective dose) is highly effective for refractory skin disease,​[^[44]] but its use is tightly restricted as it is available only through a controlled distribution system. Adverse effects limit its use to severely refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus with a high risk of scarring. A safer alternative for refractory skin disease may be lenalidomide.​[^[45]]

#### Drug-Induced Lupus Erythematosus

A wide variety of drugs are capable of inducing a drug-induced lupus (DIL).​[^[46]]​[^[47]] Commonly associated drugs include procainamide, hydralazine, quinidine, isoniazid, chlorpromazine, minocycline, terbinafine and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. The condition can develop weeks to months after starting the drug and resolves rapidly upon discontinuation, although serology results may take 1 year to normalize. DIL is more frequent in older Caucasians where common presenting symptoms include malaise, weakness, arthralgia, myalgia and serositis. Antinuclear antibodies are universally seen. Antibodies to histones are present in  ≥75% of cases but are also seen in 60–80% of patients with idiopathic lupus.​[^[48]] Patients with idiopathic SLE form a number of other autoantibodies, including those against ds-DNA, while those with drug-induced lupus generally do not. In the case of subacute cutaneous lupus, autoantibodies to SSA/Ro and SSB/La are induced and are associated with a growing list of drugs, including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hydrochlorothiazide, leflunomide, interferons and terbinafine.​[^[47]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### SLE and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

The effect of pregnancy on SLE is variable. While some patients may experience increased disease activity during pregnancy, the overall risk of flares is not greater than in nonpregnant patients. However, flares of renal disease activity (renal lupus nephritis) may occur, and during the postpartum period disease activity may increase due in part to hormonal fluctuations (increased prolactin, changes in estrogen and progesterone levels).

#### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

Pre-pregnancy assessment of disease activity, particularly renal function, is recommended at baseline and at least once per trimester during pregnancy. For some patients, severe organ damage may preclude pregnancy, e.g., cardiomyopathy, cardiac valve disease, renal insufficiency.​[^[49]] An active disease state prior to pregnancy is associated with high-activity lupus during pregnancy and negative outcomes.​[^[50]] Such outcomes include increased rates of renal disease, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, Cesarean section, low birth weight infants and pregnancy loss. Therefore, it is preferable that the patient be in remission for 6 months prior to conception.​[^[51]]

Patients on methotrexate and mycophenolate are counselled to avoid pregnancy. These medications should be stopped 3 months (methotrexate) or 6 weeks (mycophenolate) prior to attempting conception.​[^[12]]​[^[52]] Recent small cohort studies showed no adverse pregnancy outcomes after preconception low-dose methotrexate (MTX) exposure in males​[^[53]] or females.​[^[54]] Women should still be switched to a low-risk medication e.g., azathioprine or hydroxychloroquine, and observed for disease activity over 6 months prior to conception.​[^[50]]

Leflunomide is generally avoided in patients in whom future pregnancy is a possibility. If a pregnancy is desired, a waiting period of 2 years or a “wash-out” regimen of cholestyramine 8 g TID or activated charcoal 50 g 4 times daily for 11 days (not necessarily on consecutive days) may be used following discontinuation.​[^[55]] Note that both activated charcoal and cholestyramine may affect absorption of combined oral contraceptives, and an alternative contraceptive method should be used. Following the waiting period or the wash-out regimen, verification of plasma levels (2 tests at least 14 days apart, target plasma concentration is <0.02 mg/L) is recommended. For more information, see Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Cyclophosphamide may cause permanent infertility depending on the cumulative dose and the age of the patient.​[^[52]] Intake of synthetic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), oocyte cryopreservation or embryo cryopreservation are possible fertility preservation methods that can be offered.​[^[56]]

#### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

In a high-risk pregnancy, the best obstetric outcomes are achieved by using a multidisciplinary approach with a high-risk pregnancy team. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and pregnancy complications, e.g., pregnancy losses, preeclampsia. Antibodies to SSA/Ro and SSB/La are associated with an increased risk of neonatal lupus, which may progress to congenital complete heart block in 1–2% of cases.​[^[2]]

Recommendations for the management of patients with SLE during pregnancy depend on the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies with or without antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Low-dose ASA is given empirically to patients with SLE for preeclampsia prevention and is safe in pregnancy starting around 12 weeks’ gestation with continuation to term.​[^[52]] Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without overt antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may be treated with ASA and a low-dose heparin (either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin). Those with antiphospholipid syndrome are treated with prophylactic full-dose heparin in addition to low-dose ASA, as the combination improves live birth rate and prevents preeclampsia respectively.​[^[49]]​[^[57]]

 During pregnancy, the use of NSAIDs should be restricted to the first or second trimester; even short-term NSAID use after 32 weeks is associated with a significant increase in the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and is not recommended.​[^[58]] Health Canada has begun investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant individuals 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[^[59]] This investigation is in response to a US FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[^[60]] While short-term use may not pose a significant increased risk, use beyond 48 hours may require ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected. 

Hydroxychloroquine is considered safe in pregnancy.​[^[11]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]] Its use likely reduces flares and the need for more aggressive (and toxic) therapies.

Prednisone is generally considered safe but has been associated with a small increase in the risk of cleft palate.​[^[63]] Higher doses in pregnancy are associated with complications such as hypertension, preeclampsia and prematurity. Therefore, the dose of prednisone should be kept as low as possible, but the dose should not be tapered until 3 months after delivery.​[^[27]]

Dexamethasone and any other fluorinated glucocorticosteroid should not normally be given in pregnancy, as they can cross the placenta. However, in patients with antibodies to SSA/Ro and SSB/La where the fetus has congenital heart block due to neonatal lupus, its use may be appropriate.​[^[2]]

Azathioprine is considered safe in pregnancy at doses ≤2 mg/kg.​[^[12]]​[^[64]] Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are also considered safe during pregnancy but are reserved for refractory cases.​[^[50]] 

Methotrexate, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide are teratogenic.​[^[12]]​[^[52]] Although mycophenolate appears more effective in preventing flares of lupus nephritis, common practice would be to switch to azathioprine in those considering pregnancy, and early data suggest this is safe.​[^[65]]

#### SLE and Breastfeeding

Although most NSAIDs have been shown to be present in breast milk, amounts are generally small and they are consequently considered to be safe for use in breastfeeding. Ibuprofen might be preferred due to its short half-life.​[^[66]] Hydroxychloroquine is considered safe in breastfeeding.​[^[52]]​[^[67]] Prednisone at doses ≥20 mg/day will appear in breast milk with potential to affect the infant. Azathioprine is considered safe in breastfeeding at doses ≤2 mg/kg.​[^[68]]​[^[69]] Methotrexate, mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide are not compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[52]]

#### General Considerations

Patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy may be prescribed a bisphosphonate to prevent drug-induced osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates have demonstrated adverse effects (hypocalcemia, decreased fetal bone growth) in pregnancy.​[^[70]] While a small number of exposures reported in human pregnancies did not indicate skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus,​[^[71]] the potential risks necessitate caution in prescribing bisphosphonates in those of childbearing age.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

If possible, vaccinations should be up to date prior to starting therapy. | Usually given in combination with oral prednisone with or without 3 pulses of methylprednisolone. |
| **leflunomide** (Arava, generics) | 10–20 mg daily PO | Nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, alopecia, rash, hypertension. May cause hepatotoxicity, cytopenias, pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease. | Decreased leflunomide levels with cholestyramine; increased risk of infection with live vaccines. | Alcohol restriction may minimize hepatotoxicity. Pregnancy is contraindicated while taking this medication. Wash-out procedure with cholestyramine 8 g TID × 11 days is recommended for serious toxicity or imminently planned pregnancy (see Rheumatoid Arthritis).Monitoring: baseline CBC, LFTs, creatinine, hepatitis B and C serology; CBC, LFTs, creatinine monthly × 3 months, then Q1–3 months, LFTs monthly if also on methotrexate. |
| **methotrexate** (Metoject, generics) | 10–25 mg weekly PO or SC | Nausea, malaise, headache, oral ulcers, alopecia, diarrhea, cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis.Folic acid or folinic acid 5–7 mg weekly or 1 mg daily given to reduce GI adverse effects, liver toxicity, mouth sores. | Alcohol restriction may minimize hepatotoxicity.Concomitant use of NSAIDs or penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, cloxacillin, piperacillin) does not result in clinically meaningful increase in low-dose MTX serum concentrations.​[85] Sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) may decrease MTX clearance. | Increased risk of toxicity in patients with lupus nephritis/renal impairment.​[2] MTX is abortogenic/teratogenic. Folic acid 5 mg weekly or 1 mg daily given to reduce GI adverse effects, liver toxicity, mouth sores.Monitoring: baseline CBC, LFTs, albumin, creatinine, hepatitis B and C serology, chest x-ray; repeat CBC, LFTs, albumin and creatinine monthly × 3 months, then Q1–3 months. Consider HIV screening in high-risk patients. LFTs monthly if also on leflunomide. |
| **mycophenolate mofetil** (CellCept, Apo-Mycophenolate, other generics) | Induction: 2000–3000 mg daily PO for 6 months Maintenance: 1000–2000 mg daily PO | Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyper/hypotension, edema, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypokalemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, rash. | Avoid administration of live vaccines. If possible, vaccinations should be up to date prior to starting therapy.Antacids, iron, magnesium and cholestyramine decrease absorption. Decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives. Increased mycophenolate concentrations with probenecid. | Monitor CBC weekly × 1 month, twice monthly for months 2 and 3, monthly thereafter. LFTs and creatinine monthly.Mycophenolic acid is likely equivalent in efficacy in SLE to mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolic acid 1440–2160 mg = mycophenolate mofetil 2000–3000 mg. |
| **mycophenolate sodium** (Myfortic, generics) | Induction: 1440–2160 mg daily PO for 6 months Maintenance: 720–1440 mg daily PO | Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyper/hypotension, edema, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypokalemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, rash. | Avoid administration of live vaccines. If possible, vaccinations should be up to date prior to starting therapy.Antacids, iron, magnesium and cholestyramine decrease absorption. Decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives. Increased mycophenolate concentrations with probenecid. | Monitor CBC weekly × 1 month, twice monthly for months 2 and 3, monthly thereafter. LFTs and creatinine monthly.Mycophenolic acid is likely equivalent in efficacy in SLE to mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolic acid 1440–2160 mg = mycophenolate mofetil 2000–3000 mg. |
