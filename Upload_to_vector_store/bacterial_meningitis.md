#### Introduction

Meningitis is an inflammation of the cranial and spinal leptomeninges. Anatomically, the meninges consist of 3 outer coverings of the brain and spinal cord: the dura, the arachnoid and the pia mater. The dura is tightly adherent to the cranial periosteum. The middle layer is the arachnoid and loosely covers the brain and spinal cord. The third layer is the pia mater, which is continuous with the surface of the brain and spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid is in the subarachnoid space, enclosed between the arachnoid and the pia (see Figure 1). For review articles on bacterial meningitis in particular patient populations, see Suggested Readings.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

This chapter focuses on common bacterial infections causing meningitis and does not include infections such as ventriculitis, encephalitis and brain abscesses, nor meningitis due to other causes such as viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, parasites and fungi. It does not cover the management of meningitis associated with ventricular shunts. Noninfectious causes of meningitis, such as drug-induced and carcinomatous meningitis, are also not discussed.

The most common pathogens that cause bacterial meningitis are the same pathogens that colonize the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract; they include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. During or after a respiratory viral illness, colonization rates in the nasopharynx will be up to 40%, especially in young children. The bacteria have specific fimbriae or pili that adhere to the surface of the epithelial cells of the mucosa. It is believed that a virus upregulates receptors, thereby causing increased bacterial adherence.​[^[6]] For Listeria and group B streptococcus, the source is the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract.

After colonization of the mucosa, the bacteria invade the bloodstream due to a break in the mucosal barrier. It is believed that this occurs with bacteria either passing through or between epithelial cells.​[^[7]] The presence of viable bacteria in the bloodstream allows them to invade the blood-brain barrier, likely through the choroid plexus. Experimental studies have indicated that there is a relationship between higher levels of bacteria in the blood and subsequent development of meningitis.​[^[8]] Though most cases of meningitis are believed to occur during periods of bacteremia, there may be direct spread of bacteria (especially with *S. pneumoniae*) from pre-existing otitis media or sinusitis, and, more rarely, from defects in the base of the skull such as the cribriform plate near the ethmoid sinus.

Once bacteria are present inside the subarachnoid space of the brain or spinal cord, there is little host defense; bacterial multiplication occurs, leading to the release of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines. Paradoxically, the release of cytokines can increase the influx of granulocytes, causing more inflammation. This can be augmented by bacterial lysis and further release of inflammatory agents leading to clinical symptoms of meningitis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) are among the key mediators of inflammation. The combination of inflammation, free radicals and oxidative stress is believed to cause neuronal injury resulting in long-term sequelae in the central nervous system and hearing loss.​[^[2]]​[^[9]]

**Epidemiology**

The incidence of meningitis has dramatically decreased since the use of conjugated vaccines against H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis A, C, W and Y.​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]] Most of the reduction in disease has been in children younger than 5 years of age.​[^[15]] An additional benefit of conjugate vaccines is a substantial amount of herd immunity, since these vaccines decrease nasopharyngeal carriage of the specific vaccine-associated bacteria. The herd immunity has contributed to some protection for unimmunized persons due to decreased transmission of vaccine-specific serotypes.​[^[16]] In countries with robust immunization programs, the incidence of meningitis is lower compared to areas where routine immunization schedules do not include meningitis vaccines.​[^[17]]

Table 1 lists common pathogens causing bacterial meningitis based on patient age and comorbidities. In both adults and children, the most common causes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis are S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae.​[^[18]] In areas where vaccination uptake is high, cases caused by H. influenzae type b have been almost eliminated. However, there has been a significant increase in non-b H. influenzae (especially type a) invasive disease, particularly among Indigenous populations of northern Canada and the Arctic as well as other countries.​[^[19]] It is unknown whether genetic or socioeconomic factors, such as crowded housing conditions and food insecurity, contribute to this increased risk. The only vaccine available for H. influenzae is for serotype b; vaccines for non-b serotypes are not currently available.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

Other underlying factors that may increase the risk of meningitis are a cerebrospinal leak or recent neurosurgery. Hyposplenia or asplenia also increase the risk of bacterial meningitis due to encapsulated organisms such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis. The receipt of eculizumab is associated with a 10 000-fold higher risk of meningococcal disease (0.18 per 100 000 patients compared to the general population).​[^[23]]

Other pathogens, including group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, are significant causes of meningitis in neonates, immunocompromised patients and older adults;​[^[24]] see Table 1 for more information.

Although much progress has been made with vaccines, emerging issues such as lack of vaccine for H. influenzae type a (Hia) and access and coverage of vaccines against N. meningitidis serotype B continue to keep immunization at the forefront of the management and prevention of meningitis.



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

If meningitis due to an infection is suspected clinically, assessment, investigation and management should occur promptly in an acute care or inpatient setting of a health-care facility with laboratory and imaging facilities. The clinical presentation will vary depending on age and the patient’s ability to localize symptoms and the stage of the infection. The decision to initiate investigations and treatment for meningitis remains a clinical one that is supported by laboratory parameters. Several clinical prediction models have been developed to help in the differentiation of bacterial meningitis from viral causes;​[^[26]]​[^[27]] however, some recent guidelines state that, while these models can assist in clinical management, clinical judgment is paramount in deciding on starting antibiotics,​[^[28]] while others recommend against their routine use.​[^[29]]

#### Principles of Antibacterial Therapy

Antimicrobial therapy for meningitis should be timely. Early therapy is empiric, since the causative pathogen is usually not known at the time of presentation and therefore should broadly cover the most commonly encountered pathogens in the patient’s age group. Empiric therapy may be modified according to clinical judgment and patient characteristics.

Table 1​[^[40]]​[^[41]] illustrates the most common potential organisms associated with specific risk factors (e.g., age, and specific host and environmental factors) and recommended empiric therapy.

| Enterobacteriaceae​[d] | **cefotaxime** | Meropenem. Consult infectious diseases specialist | 21 days |


#### Adjunctive Corticosteroids

Adjuvant corticosteroids are used in order to decrease the inflammation associated with infection of the central nervous system and therefore decrease the neurologic sequelae, which include deafness, strokes, blindness and cognitive impairment. Thrombosis can also be a late sequelae of acute meningitis. If corticosteroids are administered, they should be initiated either before or with the first dose of antimicrobials. The known beneficial effects are recognized with H. influenzae type b in children and S. pneumoniae in adults; however, not with meningitis due to other bacterial pathogens such as Listeria.

A theoretical concern regarding the use of dexamethasone in meningitis is the potential for delayed sterilization of the CSF (due to altered CSF drug penetration) in individuals treated with vancomycin for resistant S. pneumoniae. There are no large clinical studies to answer this question. As stated above, strongly consider the addition of rifampin to the antibacterial regimen if resistant pneumococci are isolated in a patient who has received dexamethasone.​[^[47]]​[^[48]]

#### Children

Meta-analyses have found a beneficial effect of adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids in reducing severe hearing loss in children with H. influenzae type b meningitis.​[^[49]] In meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae, the use of dexamethasone showed a trend toward protection against hearing loss. In situations where dexamethasone was given before or at the time of antibacterial administration, the benefit became significant.​[^[50]]

In a study of infants and children with meningitis, 8.1% received corticosteroids; however, no difference in mortality was observed.​[^[18]]

The use of adjunctive dexamethasone in children >4 weeks of age with community-acquired bacterial meningitis may be considered after weighing the potential benefits and risks. The recommended dose for children is 0.6 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 2 days.​[^[1]] If cultures do not reveal H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, corticosteroids should be discontinued.

#### Adults

A systematic review of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in adults with acute bacterial meningitis did not show an impact on mortality.​[^[49]] In high-income countries, corticosteroids did reduce hearing loss and short-term neurologic sequelae. This same benefit was not seen in resource-poor countries.​[^[51]] A meta-analysis of individual patient data found corticosteroids did not seem to decrease either death or neurologic disability.​[^[52]] On balance, for adults in resource-rich countries, the use of adjunctive dexamethasone is initially recommended in cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, as it might offer some benefit, especially for hearing loss and neurologic sequelae. If Listeria is suspected, corticosteroid therapy is not recommended; if already started, it should be discontinued. In a study from France, corticosteroids were associated with a worse outcome in patients with neurolisteriosis.​[^[51]]

The dose for adults has been variable in published studies. Dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours for 4 days has been used.​[^[52]] Practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2–4 days, commencing either before or with the first dose of antibacterials.​[^[53]]​[^[54]] In adults, if the cultures do not reveal H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae, corticosteroids should be discontinued.

#### Prevention

#### Vaccines

Vaccines available for the prevention of bacterial meningitis are listed in Table 5. A review of current vaccines available in Canada for children and youth has been published.
