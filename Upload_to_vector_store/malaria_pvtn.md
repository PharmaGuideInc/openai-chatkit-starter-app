#### Introduction



A detailed explanation of the natural history of malaria can be found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.​[^[1]]

After significant reduction in malaria incidence for many years, rates plateaued in 2015.​[^[2]] Malaria cases and deaths then increased in 2021 compared with previous years (primarily due to disruption in access to services and medications), with >247 million cases and >600 000 deaths in 84 endemic countries. The risk of malaria for travellers is greatest in West Africa and Oceania; intermediate in other areas in Africa, South Asia and South America; and lowest in other areas in Asia and Central America.​[^[1]] There is regional and seasonal variation of risk within these areas as temperature, humidity and rainfall are all factors in malaria transmission. Each year in Canada, 400–500 cases of malaria are reported.​[^[3]] The majority of cases are in recent immigrants or people who travel to endemic countries. Very few of the reported travel-related cases had pretravel health consultation.​[^[4]]

Despite medical intervention, infection with P. falciparum can be fatal in up to 20% of severe cases.​[^[5]] As such, prevention of disease remains the foundation of malaria intervention. Prevention measures include understanding the risk of acquiring malaria infection at the travel destination, taking chemoprophylaxis when appropriate, avoiding mosquito bites during travel and understanding when to seek medical attention, e.g., if fever develops during or after travel.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a diagram illustrating the life cycle of the malaria parasite, highlighting its stages in both humans and mosquitoes. The cycle is divided into two main sections: "In Human" and "In Mosquito."

### In Human:

1. **Sporozoite Entry:**
   - The cycle begins when a mosquito transmits a motile sporozoite into a human host.

2. **Liver Stage:**
   - The sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to the liver cells.
   - In the liver, the sporozoite reproduces asexually (schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites.

3. **Blood Stage:**
   - Merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites, and schizonts.
   - Other merozoites develop into precursors of male and female gametes.

### In Mosquito:

1. **Gametocyte Uptake:**
   - When the mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up and mature in the mosquito gut.

2. **Fertilization:**
   - The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete.

3. **Ookinete Development:**
   - Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect’s salivary glands.

4. **Transmission:**
   - The cycle completes when the mosquito transmits a motile sporozoite to another human host.

### Visual Elements:

- **Human Figure:** Represents the human host where the initial stages occur.
- **Mosquito Illustration:** Depicts the mosquito as the vector for transmission.
- **Arrows:** Indicate the direction of the life cycle progression.
- **Cell Illustrations:** Show different stages of the parasite, such as sporozoites, merozoites, gametocytes, and ookinetes.

This diagram effectively demonstrates the complex life cycle of the malaria parasite, emphasizing the roles of both human and mosquito hosts.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Malaria transmission by the anopheline mosquito mainly occurs between dusk and dawn. It is essential to take protective measures during this time when travelling to endemic countries.

| Other Considerations | Products containing a combination of DEET and sunscreen may offer less sun protection and increase DEET absorption on skin; avoid if possible. If both products need to be used, sunscreen should be applied first and allowed to penetrate the skin before application of DEET (10–15 min interval between applications is generally sufficient).​[6] | Icaridin 20% is comparable to DEET across the majority of mosquito vectors and has greater acceptability due to less odour and greasiness.​[9]​[10] | It is not recommended to use the unformulated, essential oil version of oil of lemon eucalyptus.​[16] |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Principles of Chemoprophylaxis

Prophylaxis recommendations vary among some travel medicine practitioners according to the degree of risk within a country or region. Determinants of malaria risk include endemicity, season, altitude, degree of rural travel and preventive measures for mosquito bites. In some regions of a given country, personal protection measures alone may be sufficient, while malaria chemoprophylaxis may be needed in other regions of the same country. Clinicians without experience and expertise in malaria chemoprophylaxis or who are unable to provide a complete analysis of travel-related risks (infectious and noninfectious) should consider referring patients to a well-recognized travel medicine clinic.

Considerations in choosing chemoprophylaxis include resistance patterns, time-to-travel, side effects, concurrent medications and illnesses, contraindications, pregnancy, age, and allergies. Table 2 details the choice of chemoprophylaxis agent according to resistance in a given area of travel. Clinicians are advised to consult an up-to-date source (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Public Health Agency of Canada) about the location and extent of drug-resistant Plasmodium species when counselling patients about malaria chemoprophylaxis, as recommendations may change periodically. Table 3 details the dosing schedule required for each agent, i.e., the timeframe required to take medication before and after travel, and Table 4 outlines the recommendations for pediatric, pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Table 5 details side effects, contraindications and dosage information for each agent.

| Doxycycline | 7 | 1–2 days | 4 wk​[b] |
| Primaquine | 7 | 1–2 days | 1 wk​[d] |


#### Primaquine Anti-Relapse Therapy (terminal prophylaxis)

Primaquine can also be used for anti-relapse therapy (PART) in patients with normal G6PD who are returning after extended stays (≥6 months) from areas with P. vivax and P. ovale since these species of Plasmodium have a dormant liver form (hypnozoites)​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]] that is not affected by chloroquine, atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline or mefloquine. This dormant form may reactivate and cause recurrence of infection 30 days to 5 years after exposure. When used in this context, primaquine is usually added to the standard prophylaxis as a 14-day treatment of postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., after the traveller has left the endemic area). This terminal prophylaxis is generally offered to long-term travellers, expatriates and military personnel who return to Canada, in addition to any travellers with a history of P. vivax or P. ovale disease. Primaquine may be administered for this indication to children of all ages with normal G6PD.

#### Malaria Prophylaxis in Children

Malaria morbidity and mortality is significantly greater in children <5 years of age. Nearly 80% of all deaths are in this vulnerable population and there has been little improvement since 2015.​[^[2]] Malaria caused by P. falciparum in particular is associated with higher mortality in this population and may present with non-specific symptoms leading to a risk of delay in diagnosis. Health-care providers should counsel parents on the increased risk to young children and discourage travel to endemic areas when possible. For children planning to visit malarious areas, effective protection against mosquitoes and appropriate chemoprophylaxis is strongly recommended. The drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis in children follows the adult recommendations based upon regional malaria resistance (Table 2) with the exception of doxycycline which is typically contraindicated in children <8 years of age for this indication given the required treatment duration is >21 days. The agents which are safe to use in children are summarized in Table 4.

Administration of antimalarial medications to children may present a challenge as there is a lack of pediatric formulations and many have an unpleasant taste. To mask the taste, tablets may be crushed and mixed with foods such as icing, peanut butter, jam, bananas or infant formula. Health-care providers should order a sufficient quantity of medication to allow for lost doses due to the child spitting or vomiting the medication and should provide clear instructions as to when to repeat lost doses. Compounding pharmacies may be able to dispense the medication in a capsule form to increase the dose accuracy and ease of administration. If travel will be for an extended period of time, dosage adjustment due to increasing weight of a growing child must be considered.​[^[36]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Malaria Prophylaxis during Pregnancy

Pregnant patients are more susceptible to malaria (anopheline mosquitoes are more attracted to pregnant than nonpregnant humans) and, once infected, exhibit higher morbidity and mortality rates than the nonpregnant population.​[^[37]] Malaria in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects in both the pregnant patient (e.g., anemia) and the infant (e.g., low birth weight, fetal death). In addition, premature labour may result from fever causing uterine contractions.​[^[38]] The risk of adverse effects from malaria is highest in those with P. falciparum malaria and in those who have not been exposed to malaria before. Adverse events associated with P. vivax malaria tend to be less severe. Since the consequences of malaria in pregnancy are potentially serious, pregnant patients should ideally defer travel. For those who must travel to malarious areas, special consideration should be taken; however, even the best personal protection measures, including chemoprophylaxis, are not always effective.

Avoidance and prevention of bites should be recommended as for patients who are not pregnant (see Nonpharmacologic Choices). Although DEET crosses the placenta, DEET-containing repellents are highly recommended.​[^[11]] Pyrethroid derivatives such as permethrin can also be safely used to impregnate bed nets.

Use of chemoprophylaxis has been associated with a reduced risk of severe anemia, placental parasitemia and low birth weight.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]]

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a long history of safe use during pregnancy and are recommended for prophylaxis in areas sensitive to chloroquine. Mefloquine has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth at the treatment dosage,​[^[42]] but there is substantial evidence that the dosage used for prophylaxis is not associated with either an increased risk of stillbirth or malformation in the second and third trimester. In addition, the use of mefloquine at any time from conception through to the third trimester showed rates of birth defects and fetal loss comparable to the general population.​[^[43]] Mefloquine remains the drug of choice for pregnant patients in all trimesters who require malaria prophylaxis in a chloroquine-resistant area.​[^[23]]​[^[24]] There is currently no approved chemoprophylaxis for pregnant patients who travel to chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant areas; however, in the absence of other options, atovaquone-proguanil may be considered after the first trimester if the benefits outweigh the risks. The agents that are safe to use in pregnancy are summarized in Table 4.

#### Malaria Prophylaxis during Breastfeeding

Avoidance and prevention of bites should be recommended as for patients who are not breastfeeding (see Nonpharmacologic Choices). Breastfeeding patients may use DEET-containing mosquito repellents on exposed skin. No adverse effects have been reported among children breastfed by patients who use DEET.​[^[12]]

There is little evidence-based information on malaria chemoprophylaxis in breastfeeding travellers. Breastfeeding is safe when using chemoprophylaxis agents that are safe for use in infants (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil in infants ≥5 kg).​[^[44]] According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, no untoward effects have been found in infants of breastfeeding patients using tetracyclines, suggesting that doxycycline should be safe.​[^[45]] No data are available on the use of primaquine during breastfeeding or the excretion of primaquine in breast milk. Primaquine is contraindicated during breastfeeding unless normal G6PD activities have been documented in both the breastfeeding patient and the infant. The agents that are safe to use in breastfeeding patients are summarized in Table 4.

Breastfed children do not receive sufficient drug in breast milk to protect them from malaria and must receive recommended dosages of chemoprophylaxis.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

Maximum: 400 mg sulfate salt (310 mg base) once/wk POIf it is not possible to initiate hydroxychloroquine 1–2 wk prior to exposure, a loading dose can be given to rapidly achieve the effective levels:Loading dose, adults: 800 mg sulfate salt taken in 2 divided doses, 6 h apartLoading dose, children:13 mg/kg sulfate salt taken in 2 divided doses, 6 h apart | Common: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, urticaria, dizziness, blurred vision, headache.Uncommon: hair depigmentation, skin eruptions, myopathy, reversible corneal opacity, partial alopecia, blood dyscrasias.Rare: deafness, hypoglycemia (may be serious and life threatening), myopathy, nail and mucous membrane discoloration, photophobia, retinopathy. | Alternative to chloroquine which was removed from market in Canada in 2023.Safe to use in pregnancy.Retinal toxicity is a concern with continuous use (cumulative dose >100 g chloroquine base). Screen for retinal changes every 6–12 months if taking hydroxychloroquine for >5 y, sooner if risk factors present.​[27]Avoid in patients with psoriasis as it may exacerbate the condition.May cause seizures; avoid in patients with history of epilepsy.No pediatric formulation is available in Canada and drug has an exceptionally bitter taste. Crushed tablets can be difficult to manipulate and store. The powder must be mixed with a sweet food. Alternatively, a compounding pharmacist can prepare a flavoured suspension or capsule dosage form. |
| **mefloquine** (generics) | Each tablet contains 250 mg mefloquine base present as mefloquine hydrochloride (the amount of mefloquine base present in mefloquine tablets varies between countries)​[28]Start at least 2 wk prior to exposure and continue weekly for 4 wk after leaving the endemic areaAdminister with food and with at least 240 mL of waterAdults: 250 mg (1 tablet) once/wk POChildren:≤10 kg: 5 mg/kg once/wk PO>10–20 kg: 62.5 mg (¼ tablet) once/wk PO>20–30 kg: 125 mg (½ tablet) once/wk PO>30–45 kg: 187.5 mg (¾ tablet) once/wk PO>45 kg: 250 mg (1 tablet) once/wk POFor last–minute travel, a loading dose can be given to rapidly achieve the effective levels: >45 kg: 250 mg daily PO for 3 days, then 250 mg weekly thereafter | Common: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sinus bradycardia, nightmares, insomnia, mood alteration, anxiety, irritability.Uncommon: hair loss, skin rash.Rare: permanent dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance; seizures; psychosis; thrombotic-thrombocytopenia purpura. | Considered drug of choice for pregnant patients who require malaria prophylaxis in a chloroquine-resistant area.Contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders, self-endangering behaviour, suicide attempts or suicidal ideations.​[29]​[30]Severe neurological and psychiatric reactions (seizures and psychosis) occur rarely in patients who use the drug at appropriate prophylactic doses.​[31]​[32] In clinical trials, side effects of mefloquine severe enough to require discontinuation occurred in about 5% of users. Less severe but disabling neuropsychological side effects (anxiety, abnormal dreams, insomnia, depression, irritability) are more common.​[31]​[32]​[33]​[34] Other adverse effects (dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance or tinnitus) can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent.​[29]​[30]Loading dose is associated with an increased risk of depression.When possible, mefloquine may be started 4 wk prior to departure to allow time to assess for adverse effects prior to travel since 70% of severe adverse reactions occur within the first 3 doses. |
| **primaquine phosphate** (Primaquine) | Each tablet contains primaquine base 15 mg (equivalent to primaquine phosphate 26.3 mg). Doses expressed in primaquine baseStart 1–2 days prior to exposure, continue daily while in the malarial region and for 7 days after leaving the endemic areaAdminister with foodAdults:Primary prophylaxis: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO. Maximum: 30 mg base or 2 tablets daily POTerminal prophylaxis: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO × 14 daysChildren (>9 y):Primary prophylaxis: 0.5 mg base/kg/day PO. Maximum: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily POTerminal prophylaxis: 0.5 mg base/kg/day PO × 14 days. Maximum: 30 mg base (2 tablets) daily PO | Common: hemolysis with G6PD deficiency.Uncommon: GI upset (take with food).Rare: methemoglobinemia. | Primaquine is a potent oxidizing agent that can induce severe hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. A G6PD level is mandatory before primaquine is used.Contraindicated in pregnancy because of unknown G6PD status of infant and subsequent risk of hemolysis.Methemoglobinemia has been precipitated in HIV-infected patients who are being treated or are on prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, especially if taken with dapsone. |
| **doxycycline** (generics) | Start 1–2 days prior to exposure; continue daily while in the malarial region and for 4 wk after leaving the endemic areaAdminister with food and plenty of water. Important not to recline for 30–60 min after administrationAdults: 100 mg daily POChildren: >8 y: 2 mg/kg/day PO. Maximum: 100 mg/day | Common: GI upset, photosensitivity, staining of teeth in children and fetuses, candida vaginitis (use fluconazole for self-treatment).Uncommon: azotemia in renal disease, enterocolitis. Rare: allergic reactions, blood dyscrasias, esophageal ulcerations. | Contraindicated in pregnancy.Contraindicated in children <8 y unless there are no other treatment options. Note that doxycycline can be administered for short durations (21 days or less) regardless of patient age.​[35]Because of the increased risk of photosensitivity, use sunscreens to block UV radiation. |
