#### Pathophysiology

The skin and its appendages (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles) serve several important functions. The skin protects against minor injury, helps to control body temperature and water loss, prevents invasion by microorganisms, and prevents radiation damage from sun exposure. It is composed of 3 layers: epidermis (which includes the stratum corneum), dermis and subcutaneous tissue (see Figure 1).​[^[1]] Acute or chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can result in skin damage.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a labeled diagram of a cross-section of human skin, illustrating its structure and components. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Layers of the Skin:**
   - **Epidermis:** The outermost layer of the skin.
   - **Dermis:** The middle layer beneath the epidermis.
   - **Subcutaneous Tissue:** The innermost layer, also known as the hypodermis.

2. **Structures within the Skin:**
   - **Hair:** Extends from the surface into the dermis.
   - **Hair Follicle:** The structure from which hair grows, located in the dermis.
   - **Sebaceous Gland:** Attached to the hair follicle, responsible for secreting sebum (oil).
   - **Arrector Pili Muscle:** A small muscle connected to the hair follicle, responsible for causing hair to stand (goosebumps).
   - **Sweat Duct:** A channel that carries sweat from the sweat gland to the surface of the skin.
   - **Sweat Gland:** Located in the dermis, responsible for producing sweat.

This diagram provides a clear representation of the skin's anatomy, highlighting the relationship between different components and layers.

#### Ultraviolet Radiation

Ultraviolet (UV) light is divided into 3 categories: UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (280–320 nm) and UVC (100–280 nm). UV radiation is strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and at high altitudes and is intensified by wind, humidity, high temperatures, air pollution and reflective surfaces (e.g., water, sand, snow, concrete).​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Indoor tanning salons usually provide significantly more intense UV exposure than a person would receive from natural sunlight, particularly the levels of UVA.



The UV index is provided by Environment Canada and predicts the strength of the sun's UV rays. Higher UV readings indicate a higher risk of sunburn as the rays are stronger. UV indexes of 3 or more are reported daily.

#### Sun-Induced Skin Damage

Sun-induced skin damage can occur in skin of any colour and can be acute or chronic as discussed below. Additionally, acute and chronic sun exposure can exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous lupus, rosacea and melasma.

#### Acute sun-induced skin damage

Acutely, sun exposure can cause sunburn, phototoxic drug eruption, polymorphous light eruption and solar urticaria.



#### Chronic sun-induced skin damage

Chronic exposure of the skin to UV radiation can cause photoaging, pigmentation abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions (e.g., actinic keratoses) and skin cancer (keratinocyte cancer and melanoma).

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a skin lesion on a person's skin. The lesion appears to be irregular in shape and has a mix of colors, including shades of brown and possibly black. The surrounding skin is slightly red and appears to be normal in texture. The lesion is raised compared to the surrounding skin, which is covered with fine hair. This type of lesion could be indicative of a skin condition that may require further medical evaluation, such as a biopsy, to determine its nature. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Pharmacologic therapy for the prevention of sun-induced skin damage consists of the correct use of sunscreen.

Sunscreens effectively reduce skin tanning and burning when applied correctly.​[^[26]] Sunscreen use has also been shown to reduce photoaging and the development of actinic keratosis and promote the regression of existing actinic keratosis.​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]

Evidence for the effect of sunscreen use on development of skin cancer is limited due to the difficulty inherent in studying conditions that develop over prolonged periods of time. A systematic review was unable to demonstrate whether sunscreen was effective for the prevention of basal cell carcinoma.​[^[30]] However, a mathematical model has suggested that regular use of sunscreen during the first 18 years of life would reduce the lifetime incidence of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma by 78%.​[^[31]] The only randomized trial showed the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was significantly lower in a group using daily sunscreen application versus a no daily sunscreen application group.​[^[32]] Studies have shown a reduction in melanoma with sunscreen use.​[^[19]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]]

 Experts agree that sunscreen use alone is unlikely to prevent skin cancer but should be considered an important adjunct to nonpharmacological means of preventing sun exposure.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]] See Nonpharmacologic Therapy.

The Canadian Dermatology Association recommends that sunscreens should:​[^[38]]





Antioxidants (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea polyphenols) have been added to topical sunscreen products due to their ability to scavenge the reactive oxygen species that are generated in the skin after UV exposure, theoretically enhancing protection from UV damage. However, antioxidants are inherently unstable and difficult to incorporate into products in a way that will maintain clinical effectiveness. As antioxidant stabilizing techniques evolve, they have the potential to increase protection from UV damage over sunscreen alone.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Sunscreens.

Sunless tanning products can be chemical tanning agents such as **dihydroxyacetone** (DHA) or bronzers that contain extracts of walnut oil or jojoba. DHA is a dye that colours the skin when applied topically, taking 24–72 hours to take effect. It is resistant to soap, water and sweat; however, the colour change is temporary and will gradually fade over 3–7 days from the last application. These agents have a very low SPF value of 3–4 unless marketed in combination with sunscreen products. DHA is considered nontoxic and is regulated as a cosmetic rather than a drug. Bronzers coat the outer layer of the dermis only and last until they are washed off with soap and water.​[^[41]]​[^[42]]

#### Sunscreen Labelling

Sunscreens should be used to protect the skin and not to prolong sun exposure. They should be broad spectrum, meaning they contain recognized ingredients that protect against both UVA and UVB (see Table 2) and have an SPF of at least 30.​[^[38]] SPF is defined as the least amount of energy needed to produce erythema (primarily UVB) with sunscreen, divided by the least amount of energy needed to produce erythema without sunscreen. In Canada, sunscreens with the “broad spectrum” designation and SPF ≥15 may use the following statement: “If used as directed with other sun protection measures, decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.” Sunscreens with an SPF <15 or not designated as “broad spectrum” must use the following statement: “This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging.”​[^[45]]​[^[46]]

Although there is limited evidence that very high SPF (e.g., >50–100) may offer some increased protection in controlled conditions,​[^[47]] there are concerns that higher SPF numbers may be misinterpreted by consumers, e.g., thinking that a product with twice the SPF will provide twice the protection (in actuality, blockage of UVB rays may be only marginally better); not understanding that high SPF (mostly UVB coverage) may not be as protective overall as low SPF with broad (UVA and UVB) spectrum coverage; and encouraging underapplication due to the perception that high SPF products need not be applied as rigorously. As a result, many organizations impose limits on the SPF number that may be used in labelling. Products with an SPF >50 must be labelled as SPF 50+ in Canada.

Water-resistant products may be labelled only as “Water/Sweat Resistant (40 minutes)” or “Water/Sweat Resistant (80 minutes).”​[^[45]]​[^[46]]

Store sunscreen according to manufacturer labelling recommendations. Extreme temperatures (e.g., such as in a hot vehicle >8 h) may result in separation and discoloration of the product, which may affect efficacy.​[^[36]]

#### Sunscreen Application

Sunscreen is not recommended in children <6 months of age, as direct sun exposure should be avoided in this age group. Seek or create shade using items such as stroller hoods/covers and umbrellas. Dress the infant in a wide-brimmed hat and lightweight, loose-fitting clothing that covers the arms and legs. In the exceptional case where sun exposure is unavoidable despite these measures, a broad-spectrum sunscreen for babies can be applied to the small exposed areas (e.g., face, back of hands).​[^[48]]​[^[49]] Inorganic (physical) sunscreens containing zinc oxide and/or titanium oxide are minimally absorbed and less likely to cause sensitization.​[^[50]] Children 6 months of age or older should follow the same sun protection advised for adults.​[^[46]]

To ensure full effectiveness, sunscreen should be applied uniformly and liberally 15–30 minutes prior to exposure over the entire area of sun exposure, including lips, ears and tops of the feet.​[^[2]]​[^[36]]​[^[46]] It should be reapplied after swimming, sweating or towelling off and at least once during prolonged outdoor exposure.​[^[51]] It is recommended that 2 mg of sunscreen per cm​[^2] of skin be applied to the body to ensure that the SPF protection claimed by the manufacturer is reached.​[^[17]]​[^[21]]​[^[52]]​[^[53]] It has been suggested that sunscreen application is approximately 20–50% less than the recommended amount in real-world conditions.​[^[53]] An easier way to measure the appropriate amount of sunscreen is referred to as the “teaspoon rule.” It is recommended that 1 teaspoonful (5 mL) be used to cover the face, head and neck; 1 teaspoonful to cover one arm (shoulder to fingers); 2 teaspoonsful (10 mL) to cover the front and back of the torso and 2 teaspoonsful to cover one leg front and back (hip to toes).​[^[36]]​[^[52]]

Many individuals do not apply enough sunscreen to attain the stated SPF of the product. Ensure that patients are aware of the proper application method and that sunscreen should be reapplied after sweating or being in water. Sunscreen vehicles affect the application of the product: lotions and creams are the most common vehicles used and are formulated as oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions; inadequate application may occur because the products may be greasy and less desirable than other formulations such as gels or sprays. Gels are generally alcohol-based and feel less greasy but can be drying. They may be preferred by patients with oily skin. Gels are easily removed when swimming or sweating. Spray formulations are convenient and less messy than creams, lotions and gels but they are often applied incorrectly, resulting in a thin layer of coverage and/or areas that are missed completely.​[^[54]] Proper application of a spray sunscreen involves holding the container 10–15 cm from the skin, spraying liberally and then using the hands to spread the product evenly over the area and rub it in. Spray sunscreens should be applied in well ventilated areas (away from the wind) in order to avoid breathing in the product.​[^[46]] Lip balms with SPF may be more acceptable to use on the lips as they are formulated to stay in place longer without getting into the mouth.

It is generally recommended that sunscreen be applied before **insect repellent**.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] The evidence upon which to base recommendations about the order of application is sparse. One study found that concurrent application of sunscreen with the insect repellent **DEET** lowered SPF by 33% and noted that delaying application of DEET after sunscreen application allowed the sunscreen to maintain slightly more of its original SPF.​[^[57]] The efficacy of DEET appears to be maintained whether it is applied before or with​[^[58]] sunscreen, although reapplication of a sunscreen-only product on top of DEET reduced the protection time of the repellent by an hour in one laboratory study.​[^[59]]

#### Sunscreen and Vitamin D

Vitamin D synthesis requires UVB exposure. In theory, 90% of the required vitamin D can be produced this way. In practice, the production of vitamin D is highly variable depending upon which area of skin is exposed to the sun and for how long, latitude, skin pigmentation, age and season.​[^[60]] There has been some concern that the increased use of sunscreen decreases the synthesis of vitamin D. Limited available evidence using moderate SPF (~15–16) sunscreen suggests that “real world” application of sunscreen does not affect vitamin D production significantly.​[^[61]]​[^[62]]​[^[63]] Further studies using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF are needed. The Institute of Medicine’s updated *Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D* concludes that the impact of sunscreen use on vitamin D synthesis needs to be clarified; however, it bases its vitamin D dietary intake recommendations on an assumption of minimal sun exposure and recommends the same daily intake irrespective of sunscreen use.​[^[64]]

#### Sunscreen Safety

Limited animal and laboratory studies on the safety of some sunscreen ingredients or additives are inconclusive; studies are ongoing. The FDA is proposing new sunscreen rules that will require more rigorous evidence of safety of chemical sunscreens.​[^[65]] Systemic absorption of chemical sunscreens in humans is poorly documented, but some evidence has shown that absorption may reach levels sufficient to trigger standard drug safety testing, to which these products (often regulated as cosmetics) have not previously been subject.​[^[66]]​[^[67]] Determination of the clinical importance of the absorption of chemical sunscreen ingredients requires further research and experts encourage consumers to continue using sunscreen given its extensive evidence of benefit.​[^[68]]​[^[69]]

Concerns about the environmental impact of sunscreens have been raised, as it is estimated that 25% of sunscreen is washed off of swimmers within 20 minutes of exposure to water.​[^[70]] Some jurisdictions (e.g., Hawaii) have restricted use of some sunscreen ingredients due to concerns about harmful effects on coral and other marine organisms.​[^[71]] Further study is needed.​[^[72]]

#### Treatment of Sun-Induced Skin Damage

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy





#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Care Products: First Aid.

#### Therapy for Sunburn

Skin protectants such as occlusive ointments (e.g., petrolatum) and emollients (e.g., mineral oil) provide symptomatic relief of minor sunburns and redness. These products protect the area from irritation caused by friction from clothing and moisturize and rehydrate the skin. Bath and baby oils have minimal effect and peanut and corn oil are ineffective.​[^[74]]

Analgesics are used short term to relieve pain and mild inflammation caused by sunburn. They should be taken immediately after exposure, as inflammation generally occurs within the first 24 hours. Anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen **sodium** or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are recommended. Acetaminophen can also be used for simple pain relief if anti-inflammatories cannot be used.​[^[74]]

**Topical** aloe vera has traditionally been promoted for its wound-healing ability. A systematic review found that there is inconclusive evidence to determine whether aloe vera gel or dressings improve outcomes in acute wounds, including burns.​[^[75]] The amount of active ingredient in aloe vera products varies according to growing conditions, age of the plant, harvesting and extraction methods used.​[^[76]] Some patients may experience burning sensation, contact dermatitis or mild itching with topical use.

#### Therapy for Photoaging

Treatment of photoaged skin may include a combination of nonpharmacologic therapies (see Nonpharmacologic Therapy) and pharmacologic therapies. Pharmacologic treatment may also include combinations of various topical products for best results.

Commercial skin care products containing **retinol** have limited efficacy because the skin is able to convert only small amounts of retinol to retinoic acid. Products containing **vitamin A** do not contain sufficient concentrations of retinoids to effectively treat photoaging and are likely added for their moisturizing properties.​[^[77]] See also Topical Retinoids.

Antioxidants including vitamin C and coenzyme Q10 **derivatives** are included in many products purported to improve the signs of photoaging. Other compounds being investigated for their ability to reverse the signs of photoaging include soy isoflavones, green tea polyphenols, lutein, carotenoids, ginseng and peptides. In some cases there are (mostly) commercial in vitro studies showing promising results, but uncertainty around their clinical effectiveness remains because of the lack of independent, published in vivo evidence and questions about their effectiveness/stability in combination with other compounds and in the low concentrations that are available without a prescription.​[^[78]]​[^[79]]

Oral collagen supplements are widely marketed for treatment of photoaging. A systematic review of RCTs (mostly small and of limited quality) assessing oral collagen supplementation for wound healing and skin aging found improvements in skin hydration, elasticity and dermal collagen density.​[^[80]] Larger studies incorporating standardized and objective assessments are needed. Adverse effects have not been reported; however, contamination is a concern as with all unregulated nutraceutical products.

Biotin (vitamin B7) supplements are also marketed as being beneficial for photoaging, despite evidence of effectiveness (in the absence of documented vitamin B7 deficiency) being limited to case reports and small studies. Concern about widespread use of biotin supplements has been raised, as high biotin intake can interfere with certain laboratory tests (e.g., PTH, TSH, T4, T3, troponin), leading to missed or inappropriate diagnoses.​[^[81]]

Alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic acid and lactic acid) are widely available in low concentrations (usually 5–12%) in many commercial products marketed for photoaged skin. Although scientific evidence of clinical effectiveness is limited,​[^[82]]​[^[83]] anecdotal evidence is widely accepted. These products may help reduce the appearance of minor photodamage by reducing fine lines, and improve skin firmness and tone by removing dead cells from the surface of the skin. Higher concentrations are required for deeper effects and must be administered under supervision of a dermatologist (see Chemical Peels).

Hydroquinone products are used to lighten darkened skin areas that appear with photoaging (e.g., solar lentigines/liver spots), leading to a more even skin tone. Hydroquinone interacts with melanin production in the lower layers of the epidermis. Skin improves over weeks to months. Recurrence is prevented by limiting sun exposure and using a sunscreen, particularly on areas that have been treated.​[^[84]] Skin irritation, redness and allergic or contact dermatitis have been reported. Hydroquinone can occasionally cause reversible discoloration of the fingernails and has been rarely associated with exogenous ochronosis (persistent blue-black or brown-grey pigmentation of the skin) particularly in dark-skinned individuals.​[^[85]] Some countries have banned hydroquinone due to concerns about carcinogenicity and renal toxicity after oral administration in mice and rats.​[^[86]]​[^[87]] There is also some concern that hydroquinone may be harmful to the environment. In light of these concerns, products containing >2% hydroquinone require a prescription in Canada.​[^[88]] Best results for hyperpigmentation include combining hydroquinone with other compounds used for skin lightening, including topical retinoids and topical corticosteroids (reduce production of melanin).​[^[15]]

**Topical retinoids** are thought to increase synthesis and inhibit degradation of collagen leading to less pronounced wrinkles, initiate epidermal proliferation causing increased smoothness of the skin and decreased melanin content, and enhance keratinocyte shedding leading to improvement in skin discoloration. They have also been shown to block skin degradation following sun exposure. Improvement is typically seen after several weeks of treatment. Continued treatment over 6–12 months results in skin that is smoother and less sallow, has reduced fine and coarse wrinkles, and is less mottled.​[^[79]]​[^[84]]​[^[89]] Only **tazarotene cream** is currently approved in Canada for this indication; however, in practice, other available topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene) are also used. Adverse effects include burning, irritation, redness and dryness, which usually subside over time. A titrated approach to treatment can minimize these reactions.

Chemical peels induce controlled damage to the skin at various skin depths. Regeneration and re-epithelialization of the epidermis and dermis result in firmer skin with a more even skin tone, improved skin texture, reduced wrinkles and decreased number of actinic keratoses.​[^[13]]​[^[90]] Chemical peels can be classified as superficial, medium or deep. Superficial peels are commonly used in mild photoaging and contain alpha-hydroxy acids (glycolic acid 20–70%, lactic acid, malic acid) and/or beta-hydroxy acids (salicylic acid 10–30%). Medium-strength peels are used in mild-to-moderate photoaging and contain trichloroacetic acid alone or combined with glycolic acid (>70%). Superficial and medium chemical peels are relatively safe procedures when performed by an experienced clinician; however, complications such as irritation, burning, erythema, pruritus and blistering can occur.​[^[91]] Deep chemical peels contain phenol and may require the patient to undergo sedation or general anesthesia. They carry a risk of toxicity and serious complications and may take weeks to recover from.

Botulinum toxins do not reverse photodamage but appear to rejuvenate the skin by relaxing the underlying musculature. The effects of treatment typically last 3–6 months depending on the degree of photodamage, the age of the patient and the dosage used.​[^[13]] Only onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA are approved for this indication in Canada.

Various injectable soft tissue fillers can be injected into wrinkles to improve the hydration and appearance of the skin. Hyaluronic acid is the most commonly used. Results usually last 6–9 months in areas with more movement and up to 1 year in areas of limited mobility.​[^[13]]

Figure 3 presents an assessment of patients requesting treatment for nonacute sun-induced skin damage (also see Table 4).

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 3 provides a plan for the monitoring of therapy for sun-induced skin damage.

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early photodamage(fine wrinkles, dry skin) | Monitor for changes in skin appearance (rough, dry skin with surface or deep wrinkles).Monitor regularly for signs of mottling or pigment changes (liver spots or age spots). | Skin feels softer, smoother, fine wrinkles less apparent.Skin does not show signs of pigment change. | Prevention is the most effective treatment (continual use of sunscreens with SPF 30 or more).Pharmacological treatment may improve or reverse signs (see Figure 3). |
| Sunburn | Monitor for 24–48 h after unprotected sun exposure for worsening or improvement of burn.Monitor pain for 24–48 h. Monitor for 7 days for signs of infection (particularly if blistered). | Sunburn lessens or disappears after 48 h.Pain relief is adequate.No signs of infection after 48 h. | Cool compresses to relieve pain.Analgesics for pain relief (acetaminophen, ibuprofen).Skin protectants such as petrolatum to protect and moisturize.Avoid further exposure.Signs of infection require assessment and treatment if appropriate. |
| Actinic keratosis | Monitor regularly for dry, scaly lesions on chronically sun-exposed areas (particularly age ≥50 y).Monitor closely for signs of change (size, shape, colour). | No signs of actinic keratosis, e.g., firm, scaling lesion with slight erythema. | Avoid chronic exposure to sun.Further investigation required if changes in the lesion (to rule out progression to SCC) or if any suspicious lesions elsewhere on skin (patients with AK are also at increased risk of developing BCC or melanomas).Wear sunscreens regularly and cover area to protect from further sun exposure. |

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Mechanism of Action | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **glycolic acid** (Neostrata Glycolic Renewal, others) | 5–10% cream/lotion/solution: apply daily to BID | Removes dead cells from surface of skin, leading to less visible lines and wrinkles and a smoother appearance. | Initially (but decreasing with time): burning, stinging, redness. Increases sensitivity to UV light: always use in conjunction with sunscreen and other sun protection measures. | Higher concentrations (20–70%) used in superficial chemical peels under expert supervision may provide deeper effects, including thickening of the epidermis and depigmentation.May cause hyperpigmentation: avoid use in dark-skinned patients.Pregnancy: low systemic absorption, unlikely to pose a risk to the fetus.​[92]​[93]Breastfeeding: low systemic absorption: considered compatible.​[92]​[93] |
| **lactic acid** (Dermalac, others) | 5–12% lotion: apply daily to BID | Removes dead cells from surface of skin, leading to less visible lines and wrinkles and a smoother appearance. | Mild redness, dryness.Increases sensitivity to UV light: always use in conjunction with sunscreen and other sun protection measures. | May cause hyperpigmentation: avoid use in dark-skinned patients.Pregnancy: low systemic absorption, considered safe.Breastfeeding: low systemic absorption, considered compatible. |
| **hydroquinone** (Actifade, others) | 2–4%: apply thinly BID | Decreases melanin production, leading to lighter skin tone over weeks to months (varies between individuals). | Skin irritation, redness and risk of contact dermatitis.Reversible discoloration of the fingernails. | Often combined with glycolic acid and sunscreen.Use in conjunction with sunscreen decreases risk or recurrence of dark pigment.Pregnancy: limited data have not shown major malformations or adverse effects; however, significant systemic absorption occurs and exposure should be minimized until safety is confirmed.​[93]Breastfeeding: no data available, use likely not justified. |
| **adapalene** (Differin, Differin XP) | 0.1% cream, gel, 0.3% gel: apply QHS | Decreases fine lines, improves skin texture, tone, elasticity, mottled pigmentation. Slows progression of photoaging. | Scaling, redness, burning and dermatitis, which often subsides with continued use.May cause increased sensitivity to the sun: apply at bedtime and use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥15) during the day. | A minimum of 4 months of treatment is required to see any positive results.Not a Health Canada–approved indication.Pregnancy: contraindicated: safety has not been sufficiently documented.​[94]Breastfeeding: minimal systemic absorption, considered compatible.​[92]​[93] |
| **tazarotene** (Tazorac) | 0.05%, 0.1% cream or gel: apply QHS | Decreases fine lines, improves skin texture, tone, elasticity, mottled pigmentation. Slows progression of photoaging. | Scaling, redness, burning and dermatitis, which often subside with continued use.May cause increased sensitivity to the sun: apply at bedtime and use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥15) during the day. | A minimum of 4 months of treatment is required to see any positive results.Pregnancy: contraindicated: safety has not been sufficiently documented.​[94]Breastfeeding: minimal systemic absorption, considered compatible.​[92]​[93] |
| **tretinoin** (Retin-A Micro, Stieva-A) | 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.05%, 0.1% cream, gel: apply QHS | Decreases fine lines, improves skin texture, tone, elasticity, mottled pigmentation. Slows progression of photoaging. | Scaling, redness, burning and dermatitis, which often subside with continued use.May cause increased sensitivity to the sun: apply at bedtime and use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥15) during the day. | A minimum of 4 months of treatment is required to see any positive results.Not a Health Canada–approved indication.Pregnancy: contraindicated: safety has not been sufficiently documented.​[94]Breastfeeding: minimal systemic absorption, considered compatible.​[92]​[93] |
