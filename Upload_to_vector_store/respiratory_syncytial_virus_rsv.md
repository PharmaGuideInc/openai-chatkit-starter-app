#### Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes disease starting in the first year of life and continues to do so throughout an individual’s lifespan.​[^[1]] RSV is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus transmitted via respiratory droplets and fomites such as door handles. In most Canadian regions, it follows a similar seasonal distribution as influenza, with the start of RSV season in the fall (Sept/Oct), its peak in the winter (Jan/Feb) and its end in the spring (Mar/Apr).​[^[2]]​[^[3]] In Northern latitudes of Canada, the RSV seasonality is slightly shifted and ranges from December to April/May.​[^[4]] Surveillance information for circulating RSV disease in Canada is available in the Respiratory Virus Trends in Canada report.

The F surface protein drives the pathogenesis in its prefusion conformation, which mediates viral entry and the formation of syncytia (the fusion of infected and neighbouring [healthy] cells to form a cytoplasmic mass containing multiple nuclei).​[^[5]] The virus causes mild symptoms in most patients; however, superficial damage to the airway lining predisposes the patient to secondary bacterial infections. In vulnerable populations such as infants and older adults, increased viral loads can lead to increased neutrophilic inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts.​[^[6]] Medically attended visits and hospitalizations are often due to lower airway obstructions due to the accumulation of mucus and cell debris from neutrophilic inflammation.​[^[7]]

The clinical overlap of RSV with other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, COVID-19), has made diagnosis and surveillance an ongoing challenge. However, the impact of respiratory infections on the health-care system, as demonstrated by COVID-19, has led to increased differential diagnostic testing in the inpatient and outpatient settings; this has allowed for a more precise identification of causative pathogens. Furthermore, recently approved prevention options have provided health-care professionals with important tools to protect their vulnerable patients.

This chapter focuses on the clinical investigations, risk factors for severe RSV disease, and prevention and treatment options for RSV to reduce the impact of the disease on the population.

#### Prevention

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

Prevention of RSV consists of infection control protocols, vaccination in pregnant individuals and older adults, and monoclonal antibodies in neonates.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Adults with RSV can spread the disease 1–2 days prior to symptom onset and remain contagious for approximately 14 days following the presentation of symptoms.​[^[8]] 

General measures to prevent the spread of RSV are the same as for all other respiratory viruses and include:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 1 lists the vaccines and monoclonal antibodies used in the prevention of RSV.

#### RSV Vaccines



#### Guillain-Barré Syndrome

A small number of participants in RSV vaccine clinical trials developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and early postmarketing surveillance in the United States identified a higher-than-expected number of GBS cases in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), triggering further, in-depth investigation.​[^[21]] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the safety surveillance data and provided a favourable benefit-risk ratio for both vaccines. Ongoing GBS safety monitoring was recommended by ACIP.​[^[21]]

#### Monoclonal antibodies



#### Treatment

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

History, with attention to symptoms and their onset, is the key to appropriate testing and use of antiviral agents to manage circulating viral respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, influenza and RSV. All 3 viruses can present with a range of overlapping symptoms categorized as systemic, upper respiratory and lower respiratory:​[^[4]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]



Specific to RSV, 89–95% of infected patients are symptomatic, with the majority exhibiting signs of URTI, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and sore throat.​[^[26]] Approximately 50% of symptomatic patients will develop systemic symptoms of varying severity.​[^[27]] In symptomatic individuals, LRTI can occur, and in high-risk populations, this can result in bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, all requiring hospitalization.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[31]]

Clinical presentation of RSV in infants is characterized by rhinorrhea, sneezing, pharyngitis, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever or respiratory distress.​[^[32]] RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, which is the obstruction of small airways caused by acute inflammation, edema and increased mucus production.​[^[33]] For children in their first year of life, bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospital admission.​[^[34]]

Diagnostic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of RSV. Viral RNA detection by real-time PCR is preferred to other methods, as antigen testing and viral culture have been shown to have poor sensitivity.​[^[26]] Historically, some patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILI) may be infected with RSV.​[^[26]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



Sterile saline solution may help to clear nasal secretions; however, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness for bronchiolitis in infants.​[^[35]]

At-home monitoring of patients is required to determine if a medically attended visit is required; signs and symptoms include:



Any changes in the above indicating worsening or no improvement over 3–5 days along with clinical judgment (consider: respiratory status, ability to maintain hydration and risk of progression to severe disease) should prompt a visit to a medical care provider.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Analgesics/Antipyretic Agents

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used for relief of fever, headache and myalgias. Caution patients to avoid the concurrent use of cough and cold products, as they may contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen (increasing risk of overdose) as well as other ingredients such as antihistamines, which may not be needed. Other ingredients contained in cough and cold products (e.g., decongestants, cough suppressants, expectorants) have shown limited benefit and should not be used in children under the age recommended on the label (typically <6–12 y). For children who are dehydrated and/or have reduced feeding intake, use caution with ibuprofen to avoid the risk of acute kidney injury.

Children and adolescents should not take ASA due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome (see Fever).

#### Pharmacologic Treatment of Bronchiolitis

Treatment options for bronchiolitis are mostly supportive (e.g., oxygen, hydration; see Nonpharmacologic Choices for more information). The Canadian Paediatric Society lists the combination of nebulized epinephrine and oral dexamethasone as having equivocal evidence; until more data are available, this combination is not recommended in otherwise healthy children with bronchiolitis.​[^[36]]

The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends *against* the use of corticosteroids, salbutamol, antibiotics, antivirals, nebulized hypertonic and aerosolized saline.​[^[36]]

Further discussion of bronchiolitis treatment is outside the scope of this chapter.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### RSV and Pregnancy

Since the immune response after natural RSV infection is incomplete and short-lived, RSV reinfections occur throughout life.​[^[37]] However, unlike influenza, there is limited data illustrating the risk of RSV-related complications in healthy pregnant individuals.

#### Management

#### Prevention of RSV

Vaccination during pregnancy is an option for reducing the risk of medically attended RSV disease in infants during the first year of life. The window for vaccination to ensure placental transfer to the neonate is 32–36 weeks’ gestation.​[^[13]] There is currently no data to indicate that the birthing parent benefits from vaccination, but instead transfers antibodies across the placenta to the neonate.

With regards to preventative options in reducing the burden of RSV disease in infants within the first year of life, NACI preferentially recommends the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (administered at birth or before the first RSV season) over immunization with the bivalent RSV vaccine, due to currently available efficacy and safety data. Although there have been no head-to-head trials comparing nirsevimab and the bivalent RSV vaccine, when comparing preset clinically defined endpoints, nirsevimab demonstrates superior efficacy against hospitalization with RSV-related respiratory tract infection (81% vs. 57%).​[^[19]] In the bivalent RSV vaccine trial, there was an imbalance in preterm births in the intervention group compared with the placebo group;​[^[18]] however, both groups had lower rates of preterm birth compared with the preterm birth rate of the general population.​[^[19]]

#### Treatment of RSV

Management of symptomatic RSV in pregnant patients includes acetaminophen, which may be used to treat associated pain and fever. NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to potential reduction in amniotic fluid​[^[38]] and the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosis if used in the third trimester.​[^[39]]
