#### Pathophysiology

Hemorrhoids, or piles, are a common condition characterized by rectal bleeding, pain and itching. Hemorrhoidal (anal) cushions are normal anatomic features of the anal canal and contribute to continence. They consist of connective tissue, an arteriovenous plexus and suspensory smooth muscle. Figure 1 illustrates a normal, healthy anorectum. The pathophysiology of hemorrhoid development has not been clearly defined; tissue degeneration leading to downward displacement of the hemorrhoidal cushions and venous dilatation as well as a severe inflammatory reaction involving the vascular wall and surrounding connective tissue with associated mucosal ulceration, ischemia and thrombosis have been hypothesized.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]

Hemorrhoids can be classified as internal, external or mixed. Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line (also called pectinate or anorectal line) and should not cause pain unless complications develop, since this area has no nerve fibres. Internal hemorrhoids are further graded based on the degree of prolapse of tissue into the anal canal (see Table 1).​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] External hemorrhoids are not necessarily located outside the anal canal, but rather originate below or distal to the dentate line. External hemorrhoids can cause pain, especially if the hemorrhoidal sac is occluded by a thrombotic clot (thrombosed hemorrhoid), since this area is well innervated by pain fibres.​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Bleeding can occur if ulceration develops from necrosis of the thrombosed hemorrhoids. External skin tags (which are painless) often result after previous edematous or thrombosed external hemorrhoids.​[^[6]] Figure 2 illustrates an internal and external hemorrhoid. The term mixed hemorrhoid is used when there is involvement and bridging of the internal and external plexuses.​[^[3]] Figure 3 illustrates a mixed hemorrhoid.

| Grade | Characteristic | Symptoms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grade I | Swelling of the anal cushion causing an asymptomatic outgrowth of anal mucosa. | Painless |
| Grade II | A small part of the anal mucosa or cushion may protrude at the anus during defecation. After the bowel movement, the tissue spontaneously returns to its normal position. | Painless |
| Grade III | Hemorrhoids remain in the prolapsed position after defecation but may be replaced manually within the anus. | May be painfulRectal bleeding is common |
| Grade IV | Hemorrhoids cannot be replaced after a bowel movement, creating a permanent bulge at the anus and an exposure of anal mucosa.Risk of thrombosis, strangulation and gangrene.​[7]Surgical treatment is indicated.​[4]​[8] | Quite painful |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration of the anal canal, highlighting the locations of hemorrhoids. It includes the following labeled components:

1. **Site of Dentate Line**: This is marked to show the anatomical boundary between the upper two-thirds and lower third of the anal canal. It is a crucial landmark in distinguishing between internal and external hemorrhoids.

2. **Internal Hemorrhoid**: Located above the dentate line, internal hemorrhoids are shown within the anal canal. They are typically not visible externally and are covered by rectal mucosa.

3. **External Hemorrhoid**: Positioned below the dentate line, external hemorrhoids are depicted outside the anal canal. They are covered by anoderm and are more likely to cause pain due to the presence of somatic nerves.

The illustration uses color and shading to differentiate between the various tissues and structures, with the hemorrhoids highlighted for clarity. The surrounding anatomy, including muscle and connective tissue, is also depicted to provide context.

Hemorrhoids are common and occur in all genders, peaking between the ages of 45 and 65 and declining thereafter.​[^[9]] Symptomatic hemorrhoids are experienced by 58–86% of individuals at some point in their lives.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] A U.S. survey showed a prevalence of 4.4% in the general population, although the true incidence of hemorrhoids may be unknown as not all individuals seek care from their physician.​[^[3]] As well, some studies indicate that only 50% of patients who complain of anorectal symptoms attributed to hemorrhoids actually have simple hemorrhoids, highlighting the need for accurate diagnosis.​[^[12]] The risk factors for hemorrhoids are described in Table 2.

| Risk Factor | Proposed Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Constipation | Intrarectal pressure rises, blocking the venous return from the anal canal and leading to swollen veinsShearing action of the small, firm stools passing over the area causes a loosening of the underlying connective tissue |
| Diarrhea (acute or chronic) | Protracted and futile straining |
| Pregnancy | Enlarged uterus puts pressure on the veins; progesterone relaxes walls of veins (more prone to swelling); increase in blood volume (enlarges veins); constipation and straining |
| Advancing age | Connective tissue between the anus and rectum becomes weak |
| Spinal cord injury | Neurogenic bowel, constipation, straining |
| Occupation (e.g., heavy lifting) | Elevated abdominal pressure |
| Prolonged time on toilet/chronic straining | Perineum is relaxed and the anal cushions are unsupported in this position |
| Conditions associated with abnormal bowel function (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) | Repeated visits to the toilet, feeling of incomplete evacuation and excessive strainingDiarrhea or constipation |
| Diet low in fibre | Strained or irregular bowel movements |
| Family history | Similar diets and personal habits |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Diagnosis of hemorrhoids should be done by a health-care practitioner based on the patient’s history and results of a physical exam where appropriate (see **Resources** for information on performing and interpreting a digital rectal examination). Constipation predisposes patients to hemorrhoids; diet (fibre intake) and bowel habits (frequency, consistency and ease of evacuation) should be reviewed.​[^[4]] Patients may complain of symptoms including itching, swelling, burning, bleeding and potentially pain. Swelling is probably the main cause of pruritus. Prolapse often coincides with the beginning of a troublesome amount of discharge as a result of increased mucus production; fecal soiling of underwear often occurs. 

A detailed history describing the timing of any pain is important. The degree of discomfort experienced by the patient is dependent on the type of hemorrhoids and their severity. Internal hemorrhoids lack nerves and are usually painless unless they become prolapsed, incarcerated and gangrenous. Acute onset of pain with perianal swelling is associated with thrombosed external hemorrhoids. For some patients, the first symptom is a painful mass at the anus lasting several days to weeks, sometimes accompanied by the sudden relief of pain following rupture of the skin overlying the thrombus and bleeding. However, severe pain on defecation may indicate coexistence of an anal fissure. Other pain-associated entities to consider include inflammatory bowel disease with proctitis, perirectal fistula or abscess, anal warts, rectal cancers, anal polyps, and rectal ulcer syndrome. 

When hemorrhoids bleed, the blood is usually bright red and seen on the outer part of the stool, toilet paper or toilet bowl after defecation; the patient may not bleed at other times. Blood that is darker red or mixed with stool (including black, tarry stool) indicates bleeding from a more proximal site and may be indicative of other disease processes such as malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticular disease.​[^[2]] Referral to a physician is necessary and endoscopic examination of the colon may be required.​[^[4]]​[^[15]] Patients with symptoms suggestive of grade III or IV hemorrhoids, i.e., pain and protrusion as well as bleeding, should also be referred to a physician for further evaluation. Figure 4 outlines the assessment and management of hemorrhoids in an outpatient setting.

#### Prevention

A diet high in dietary fibre (e.g., whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits) is associated with a reduced risk of hemorrhoids.​[^[14]] The most important preventive measure is to avoid constipation (see Constipation). Advise patients not to remain on the toilet for more than 5 minutes and to avoid straining or delaying bowel movements. Encourage regular physical activity to keep bowel movements healthy and discourage prolonged sitting or standing. Advise care when lifting heavy objects.​[^[17]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Fibre is a first-line therapy for patients with hemorrhoids. Fibre may help improve constipation, pruritus due to fecal soilage, and bleeding; however, the benefit for irritation and pruritus is less well-established than for bleeding.​[^[2]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[18]] A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials showed that fibre supplementation reduced bleeding by approximately 50%.​[^[19]] The most common adverse effects in these studies were gastrointestinal symptoms, which typically occurred at the beginning of treatment and were generally not severe enough for patients to stop treatment.

There is moderate-quality evidence to support the use of dietary fibre in the medical treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. Table 3 outlines the recommended dietary fibre intake for adults in Canada. Suggest slowly increasing fibre intake to minimize problems with bloating and abdominal discomfort.​[^[15]] Providing patients with a chart of fibre content of common foods may help them to increase fibre intake (see Resources).​[^[3]] Patients must ensure adequate fluid intake (e.g., 2 L water/day) while increasing fibre intake.

If the amount of dietary fibre cannot be increased adequately, commercial fibre supplements such as psyllium, polycarbophil or wheat dextrin may be used (see Constipation). Fibre supplementation can take up to 6 weeks to significantly improve bowel movements.​[^[21]] Continued use also decreases the likelihood of recurrence.​[^[2]]

| Population​[a] | Recommended Daily Fibre Intake |
| --- | --- |
| Women 19–50 y | 25 g |
| Women ≥51 y | 21 g |
| Men 19–50 y | 38 g |
| Men ≥ 51 y | 30 g |
| Pregnant | 28 g |
| Breastfeeding | 29 g |


If these general measures do not relieve hemorrhoidal symptoms, recommend the use of a sitz bath 3–4 times daily. A sitz bath consists of a tub of warm water (about 46°C) in which the individual sits for 15 minutes at a time. Sitz baths help relieve irritation and pruritus. Their effectiveness may be related to relaxation of the internal anal sphincter.​[^[22]] Plastic sitz baths may be fitted over the toilet seat rim for greater convenience.

The anorectal area should be cleaned with mild soap and water regularly, including after each bowel movement, and gently wiped with a wet toilet tissue. Excessive scrubbing of the area must be avoided to minimize aggravation. Any prolapsed hemorrhoids should be replaced using a moistened tissue. Anti-itch wipes containing witch hazel (an astringent compound) are commercially available and may reduce itch, irritation and burning. Non-scented baby wipes can also be used. Soaps with perfume or dye should be avoided.

Surgical hemorrhoidectomy may be the most effective treatment for hemorrhoids, but the procedure can be associated with complications and/or bleeding and is recommended in only a minority of patients (e.g., for recurrent hemorrhoids, treatment failures, grade III or IV hemorrhoids, acute thrombosed hemorrhoids).​[^[3]]​[^[5]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Nonsurgical therapies (described in Table 4) are widely used to treat hemorrhoids. More than 80% of people respond to medical treatment or nonsurgical therapies; these methods cause less discomfort and entail less recovery time compared with hemorrhoidectomy.

| Therapy | Description | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rubber-band ligation | Application of rubber bands around the base of a hemorrhoid to stop the supply of blood and to cause necrosis and sloughing of the hemorrhoid. | Ambulatory procedure for grades I-III internal hemorrhoids.May result in decreased need for repeated treatment compared with injection sclerotherapy and infrared coagulation in the office-based management of grade I–III hemorrhoids.​[3] |
| Injection sclerotherapy | Injection of a chemical irritant (e.g., quinine, polidocanol or zinc chloride) into the hemorrhoid to damage blood vessels, inhibit blood supply, and cause necrosis and sloughing of the hemorrhoid. | Ambulatory procedure for grades I or II internal hemorrhoids.May have less bleeding and may be suitable for patients at high risk of secondary hemorrhage (such as patients on anticoagulants and patients with advanced cirrhosis) and those who are immunocompromised. |
| Infrared coagulation | Application of infrared light to cause tissue destruction and inflammation that results in scarring and tissue fixation. | Ambulatory procedure for small grade I or II internal hemorrhoids. |
| Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) or transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) | Usage of Doppler for nonexcisional procedure to identify branches of the rectal artery for suture ligation that results in decreased blood flow, inflammation and tissue fixation. | May cause less pain than traditional surgery. |


#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Hemorrhoids.

Pharmacologic treatments are directed towards relief of symptoms. A variety of commercial hemorrhoidal products are available (see Table 5). There is no good evidence that commercially available hemorrhoidal products reduce bleeding or prolapse,​[^[13]] and there is no evidence regarding long-term use.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] However, these agents may provide short-term relief of pain, burning, itch, discomfort and irritation while swelling subsides and healing occurs. Many commercially available hemorrhoidal products are formulated in a lubricating or emollient base with combinations of 2 or more active ingredients, including local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory agents, astringents, protectants and vasoconstrictors.

**Local anesthetics** (dibucaine, also called cinchocaine; pramoxine) are included in some topical hemorrhoidal preparations to relieve pain. If used for less than 7 days, local anesthetics are relatively safe; longer duration of use increases the risk of contact dermatitis. If a patient previously experienced contact dermatitis from benzocaine or lidocaine, pramoxine could be tried as it has a different chemical structure. Local anesthetics may mask pain of more severe anorectal disorders​[^[17]] and quality evidence of their efficacy is lacking.​[^[13]] Penetration of intact skin by local anesthetics is generally poor, but with excessive application to the rectal mucosa, absorption can occur.​[^[13]] Products containing local anesthetics should be used only in the perianal region or the lower anal canal to reduce systemic absorption.

**Anti-infective agents** (framycetin) are used to reduce superimposed bacterial infection and thereby alleviate edema, inflammation and itch.

**Anti-inflammatory agents** (hydrocortisone) are used for temporary relief of anal itch and inflammation. The onset of action may require up to 12 hours, but the effect has a longer duration than that of other agents. Local adverse effects could include skin atrophy with prolonged use and they may mask symptoms of infection.​[^[17]] The maximum recommended duration of treatment is 1 week, after which use should be reassessed. Hydrocortisone 1% is available in various combinations with zinc sulfate and/or local anesthetics. Ointments are recommended for external hemorrhoids. For internal hemorrhoids, ointment applied manually using a finger cot is preferred to using rectal tubes or suppositories.

**Astringents** (hamamelis or **witch hazel**, zinc sulfate, calamine) cause coagulation (clumping) of proteins in the cells of the perianal skin or the lining of the anal canal. This action promotes dryness of the skin, which in turn helps relieve burning, itching and pain. These are effective for mild symptoms.​[^[17]]

**Protectants** (glycerin, white petrolatum) form a physical barrier on the skin that reduces irritation, itch, pain and burning by preventing contact of the irritated skin with liquid or stool from the rectum. Their lubricating effect further protects the skin from irritation by allowing the stool to pass through the rectum more easily, potentially minimizing further tissue damage.

**Vasocontrictors** (phenylephrine) may temporarily relieve pain and inflammation and limit bleeding by constricting blood vessels.

Topical nifedipine,​[^[26]] diltiazem​[^[27]] and nitroglycerin​[^[28]] reduce the pressure of the internal anal sphincter and improve blood flow to the area. These agents have been used to treat pain and improve healing of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids. There are no commercially available products; compounding of the topical formulations is required.

**Yeast derivatives** such as Skin Respiratory Factor (SRF), an extract obtained from brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), have been used in topical hemorrhoid products to improve wound healing; however, data to support their use is scant.

**Citrus bioflavonoids** (diosmin, hesperidin) are oral phlebotonic or venotonic agents that may strengthen vein walls, increase venous tone, suppress inflammatory mediators and increase lymphatic drainage, though the precise mechanism is not known.​[^[29]] A Cochrane review and meta-analysis found a potential benefit for these agents in treating hemorrhoidal disease as well as alleviating post-hemorrhoidectomy symptoms. There was a statistically significant effect on bleeding and overall symptom improvement; however, additional trials are required to address limitations of current data.​[^[30]] A product containing micronized flavonoids as 90% diosmin and 10% hesperidin was shown to reduce the duration and/or severity of symptoms of grade I or II acute internal hemorrhoids and the overall symptoms of chronic hemorrhoids compared with placebo.​[^[31]] The most common side effects of oral diosmin are gastrointestinal effects and itchiness. Bioflavonoids may have antiplatelet or anticoagulation effects and must be used cautiously in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents.

**Oral analgesics** such as acetaminophen may provide relief of mild discomfort or pain. NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) may promote bleeding and generally should be avoided.​[^[17]] Opioids should not be recommended as they may cause constipation and worsen the hemorrhoids.

Management of constipation decreases discomfort during defecation (see Constipation).

#### Dosage Forms

Topical hemorrhoidal preparations are available in a variety of dosage forms (e.g., creams, ointments, suppositories and cleaning pads). In general, creams and ointments are recommended. Suppositories contain similar ingredients but efficacy may be impacted as they tend to slip into the rectum and melt, thus bypassing the anal canal where the medication is needed. In addition, they must melt before releasing active ingredients and, therefore, may be relatively slow acting.​[^[17]]

Before any hemorrhoidal product is applied, the anorectal area should be washed with mild soap and warm water, rinsed thoroughly, and dried gently by patting with toilet tissue or a soft cloth. Hemorrhoidal products for external use should be applied sparingly and not inserted into the rectum. An intrarectal applicator should be lubricated by spreading the ointment around the applicator tip before insertion.​[^[17]] To prevent a suppository from slipping into the rectum, advise patients to avoid inserting it too far up and to lie on their side for a few minutes after insertion.

Some anorectal preparations are safe for both external and internal use; however, some agents are limited to external use only,​[^[32]] e.g., hamamelis (witch hazel), glycerin (see Table 5).

#### Pregnancy

Pregnancy is believed to precipitate the onset of hemorrhoids in susceptible patients. A patient who experiences hemorrhoids in the last few months of pregnancy may have become symptomatic due to increased constipation and elevated intra-abdominal pressure, allowing already existing hemorrhoids to present themselves. There may also be a softening of the elastic tissue that supports anal cushions during pregnancy. In many cases, these hemorrhoids resolve after parturition.​[^[14]]​[^[33]] 

Avoidance of constipation is the main method for preventing hemorrhoids during pregnancy. Hemorrhoids in pregnancy should be treated by increasing fibre content in the diet, administering bulk fibre (e.g., psyllium), increasing fluid intake and educating on toilet habits (e.g., avoiding prolonged sitting or straining).​[^[29]]​[^[33]] While bulk-forming agents are the treatment of choice for constipation in pregnancy, polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be considered if constipation persists.​[^[34]] Alleviating constipation and taking sitz baths are usually helpful in reducing the discomfort from hemorrhoids. There is very limited reproductive safety data available for the topical agents used to treat hemorrhoids; however, most symptomatic hemorrhoids present in the third trimester when teratogenic risk of topical agents is unlikely. Products for external use should be used in pregnancy versus those inserted into the rectum, as agents placed above the dentate line can be systemically absorbed from the rectal mucosa. If an internal product is required, white petrolatum may be used.​[^[17]] Products containing local anesthetics and anti-inflammatory agents can be used during pregnancy with medical supervision. Corticosteroids should be reserved as second-line therapy when benefit justifies potential risk.​[^[34]] A trial of 204 patients exposed during the third trimester of pregnancy to a topical agent containing a corticosteroid and a local anaesthetic found no adverse fetal effects compared with placebo.​[^[35]] As with nonpregnant patients, acetaminophen may be used to relieve pain.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Check with the patient in 1 week to assess relief of symptoms such as itching, swelling or burning. If there is no relief within 7 days, if symptoms worsen, or if bleeding, severe pain, protrusion or seepage occur, reassess and consider referral to specialist care, as symptoms associated with rectal cancer, anal fissure, anal abscess, anal fistula, perianal hematoma and other diseases may be similar to those produced by hemorrhoids.​[^[36]]
