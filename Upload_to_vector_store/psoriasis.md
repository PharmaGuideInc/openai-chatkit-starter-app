#### Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated skin disease with markedly increased epidermal cellular turnover. It affects approximately 3% of the Canadian population with equal distribution among the sexes.​[^[1]] This chapter addresses plaque psoriasis only as it is the most common subtype, accounting for about 80% of cases.​[^[2]] Non-plaque types of psoriasis (erythrodermic, guttate, pustular) or psoriatic arthritis are not addressed. Clinically, plaque psoriasis presents with inflamed, thickened, well-demarcated plaques with silvery scale. Common areas of involvement include the scalp, extensor elbows and knees, sacral area and the nails. 

Up to one-third of patients with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis. In addition, a number of comorbidities have been recognized to occur with psoriasis including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, anxiety and depression. Consider early and more frequent screening for these associated comorbidities, particularly in those with moderate to severe psoriasis.​[^[3]]

Genetic predisposition plays an important role in the development of psoriasis: almost 50% of patients report a family history of the disease.​[^[4]] Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are associated with increased psoriasis severity: limiting exposure to these substances may improve psoriasis and overall health status.​[^[3]]

Before making therapeutic choices, it is essential to rule out other conditions that affect the same areas of the body and to establish the correct diagnosis. A regional approach (scalp, face, hands and feet, trunk and extremities, fold areas, nails) is provided as diagnosis and treatment varies depending on the body part affected.

#### Goals of Therapy



The management of plaque psoriasis affecting all areas of the body is illustrated in Figure 1.

#### Scalp

#### Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis can mimic or accompany scalp psoriasis. In psoriasis, the scale is usually thicker and more adherent than in seborrheic dermatitis, and there may be psoriasis in other common areas of involvement such as the knees, elbows and sacral area. Typical nail changes and arthritis may also accompany scalp psoriasis (see Nails). In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate between seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis and the term “sebopsoriasis” may be used to describe this overlap condition. Management of sebopsoriasis is similar to that of scalp psoriasis as described below; however, seborrheic dermatitis–specific treatments such as topical antifungals may also be used (see Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis).

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Wash hair at least 2–3 times per week with nonirritating, fragrance-free shampoo. This will help moisturize the involved areas of the scalp and remove scale debris. Applying shampoo to dry hair and scalp before adding water and washing can enhance removal of oil-based medicated scalp preparations.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about medications used in the treatment of psoriasis can be found in Table 3 and Table 4.

Satisfactory scale removal and control of *mild* scalp psoriasis may be achieved with regular use of nonprescription medicated shampoos containing coal tar and/or salicylic acid; however, due to odour, staining and the need for chronic treatment, regimens containing coal tar products may have poor patient adherence.

Recommended initial treatment for significant scalp psoriasis is daily use of a moderate- to ultra-high-potency **topical ****corticosteroid** for 4–8 weeks, continued until the skin is no longer inflamed, thickened and scaly.​[^[5]] If response to corticosteroids is inadequate, consider addition of a **vitamin D analogue**. A systematic review found that topical corticosteroids alone or combined with vitamin D analogues were both more effective than vitamin D analogues alone. Since safety profiles were similar and combination products provided only a marginal benefit over corticosteroids alone, monotherapy with topical corticosteroids is a reasonable, less expensive approach initially.​[^[6]] 

Scale removal through the use of keratolytic shampoos/solutions containing coal tar and/or salicylic acid just prior to application of topical corticosteroids and/or vitamin D analogues may increase penetration of the active ingredient to the affected scalp area and possibly improve effectiveness. However, this small benefit must be weighed against a possible decrease in adherence due to the increased complexity of the treatment regimen.​[^[7]] Combination products containing corticosteroid and salicylic acid are available. Lotion, solution, gel or foam vehicles are easier to apply to hair-bearing scalp and may increase patient acceptance and adherence.

After control is achieved with initial therapy, maintenance application of steroid or non-steroid topical agents 2–3 times per week may be helpful in preventing or limiting future flares.​[^[5]]

 Systemic therapy with acitretin, apremilast, biologic agents, cyclosporine, deucravacitinib or methotrexate is often helpful in severe cases of scalp psoriasis.​[^[8]] See Table 4.

#### Face

#### Introduction

Psoriasis is relatively uncommon on the face in comparison to other affected sites (elbows, knees, scalp, sacral area). It may be seen on the upper forehead as an extension of scalp psoriasis. On the face, the nature of the scale helps to differentiate among the possible diagnoses:



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about medications used in the treatment of psoriasis can be found in Table 3 and Table 4.

Hydrocortisone **1% cream** or **ointment** may be sufficient to control psoriasis of the face. Use twice-daily application initially. If hydrocortisone alone is inadequate, a **topical vitamin D analogue** may be added to the treatment regimen.​[^[5]] In more severe or resistant facial psoriasis, stronger topical corticosteroids may be used on nonresponsive areas or for acute flares in the short-term (i.e., 2–4 wk). Avoid longer-term use of moderate- or higher-strength corticosteroids on the face, as these products have been associated with skin thinning, striae, telangiectasias, purpura and acne.​[^[5]]

The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis but not psoriasis. However, these agents have been used successfully in patients with psoriasis. They are particularly useful at thinner skin sites, including the face, as there is no risk of cutaneous atrophy with extended use.​[^[5]]​[^[9]] Considerable evidence now supports the safety of these products despite some early concerns.​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]] 

The topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. It is a useful option for use on the face, as it does not have the same risk of side effects as found with topical corticosteroids.​[^[13]] 

Once control is achieved with initial therapy, the frequency of application can be gradually reduced or discontinued. Maintenance application of a topical agent 2–3 times per week may be helpful in those with recurrent disease.

Extensive facial psoriasis is uncommon and often associated with more severe psoriasis at other body sites. Systemic agents and/or phototherapy is often required for adequate control in these cases.

#### Hands and Feet

#### Introduction

Psoriasis of palms and soles is one of the most difficult dermatologic conditions to treat. Accurate diagnosis is important, as each condition in the differential requires very different treatment (see Table 1). Minimize trauma to these areas to prevent worsening of the psoriasis (Koebnerization).

| Characteristics | Plaque Psoriasis | Tinea​[a] | Eczema |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lesion | Well-demarcated scaling, hyperkeratosis | Scaling may have annular configuration (central clearing); rarely may have vesicles | Poorly defined scaling, fissures, vesicles, crusting |
| Maceration between all toes | Interdigital maceration and scaling, particularly between 4th and 5th toes | Maceration between all toes |  |
| Site | Weight-bearing areas of soles | Instep area | Weight-bearing area |
| Bilateral hands and feet | Asymmetrical | Symmetrical |  |
| Nail pitting and/or yellow discoloration and lifting of the nail plate (onycholysis) | Asymmetrical nail changes with subungual hyperkeratosis and onycholysis suggestive of onychomycosis | Nonspecific nail changes |  |
| Psoriasis at other sites | Tinea cruris | Eczema at other sites, personal or family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis) |  |


#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about medications used in the treatment of psoriasis can be found in Table 3 and Table 4.

Regular use of a nonirritating, fragrance-free moisturizer will hydrate plaques and reduce itching and desquamation. Thicker, and therefore more occlusive agents (i.e., ointments and creams compared to lotions), are more effective in hydrating the skin and providing a barrier against irritants. Moisturizers may be used alone or in combination with medicated topical agents.​[^[5]] 

Evidence from controlled trials is limited, and most treatments provide only modest benefits. Numerous treatment trials with single or combination therapies are often required before achieving an adequate response.​[^[8]]

 Moderate to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy for 4–8 weeks. Ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids are often required to treat palmoplantar psoriasis given the increased thickness of the skin at this site and resistance to treatment. If the response to topical corticosteroids is inadequate, consider adding coal tar, salicylic acid, a **vitamin D analogue** or the topical retinoid tazarotene. Various combinations of these options may be useful.​[^[5]]​[^[8]]​[^[14]] 

Ointments are the most effective vehicle at this site as they increase penetration of the drug through the thickened, scaly skin. However, creams are cosmetically more acceptable and may be preferred, especially for morning application. Use of cotton gloves or socks after application of moisturizers and/or medicated topical products to the hands or feet may enhance penetration and protect irritated skin.

Dermatologist-guided phototherapy (where available) can be a helpful treatment for more severe cases. Phototherapy may include psoralens with UVA (**PUVA**) or UVB, which may be combined with topical agents such as coal tar, anthralin, **vitamin D analogues**, topical corticosteroids or tazarotene.​[^[15]] 

Once control is achieved with initial therapy, the frequency of application can be gradually reduced or discontinued. Maintenance application of a topical agent 2–3 times per week may be helpful in those with recurrent disease.

Systemic therapy is considered for more advanced palmoplantar psoriasis. Acitretin, apremilast, biologic agents, cyclosporine, deucravacitinib and methotrexate have all been used successfully​[^[8]]​[^[14]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]] (see Figure 1).

#### Trunk and Extremities

#### Introduction

Classic plaque psoriasis on the trunk and extremities presents with well-demarcated, inflamed plaques with overlying scale. Plaques may appear pink/red in lightly pigmented skin and purple/dark brown/grey in darkly pigmented skin. Areas most commonly affected include extensor elbows and forearms, extensor knees and shins, lower back, and the gluteal fold. A family history of psoriasis may be present. 

Postinflammatory pigmentary changes may persist for months after psoriatic plaques have been successfully treated, particularly in darkly pigmented skin.



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about medications used in the treatment of psoriasis can be found in Table 3 and Table 4.

Encourage regular use of a nonirritating, fragrance-free moisturizer to the affected body sites. Thicker products (i.e., ointments and creams compared to lotions) are more effective at hydrating the skin and providing a barrier against irritants. Studies have shown that regular moisturizer use can both delay the time to subsequent psoriasis flare and enhance the therapeutic effect of a topical corticosteroid when used in combination.​[^[5]]​[^[8]] Apply medicated topical agents before moisturizers and/or in between applications of the medicated topical product. 

Topical agents such as moderate to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids, **vitamin D analogues**, tazarotene, coal tar, roflumilast, salicylic acid and anthralin may be used alone or in combination (see Figure 1).​[^[5]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

In patients with localized psoriatic plaques, therapy is often initiated with a moderate to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroid. If there is significant scale present, the keratolytic salicylic acid can be a helpful addition to remove scale and enhance penetration of the corticosteroid. If a significant response is not achieved after 1–2 months of treatment, further options include increasing the potency of the topical corticosteroid or switching to or adding another topical product such as a vitamin D analogue, tazarotene, coal tar or roflumilast. Anthralin is used less frequently given its potential for skin irritation and staining.​[^[5]]​[^[13]]



Once control is achieved with initial therapy, the frequency of application can be gradually reduced or discontinued. Maintenance application of a topical agent 2–3 times per week may be helpful in those with recurrent disease.

#### Fold Areas

#### Introduction

In skin folds (e.g., armpits, under breasts, groin), the diagnosis can be more challenging, as psoriasis often lacks the characteristic silvery scale. However, specific clinical findings can be helpful in differentiating psoriasis from other possible intertriginous skin diseases (see Table 2).

| Psoriasis | Tinea | Eczema | Candidiasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Well demarcated bright pink/red in lightly pigmented skin, purple/dark brown/grey in darkly pigmented skin | Scaling at edge | Very itchy excoriated, crusty | Bright red on lightly pigmented skin, minor skin colour changes or hyperpigmentation in darkly pigmented skin. Satellite papules and pustules |
| KOH-negative | KOH-positive | KOH-negative | KOH-positive |
| Psoriasis at other sites | Maceration between 4th and 5th toes | Eczema at other sites | Predominates in fold areas |

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about topical medications used in the treatment of psoriasis can be found in Table 3.

Twice-daily applications of hydrocortisone **1% cream** is often used initially in the treatment of psoriasis in skin fold areas. Secondary candidiasis may complicate psoriasis at these occluded sites; clotrimazole or ketoconazole are commonly used in combination with hydrocortisone for this reason, particularly if the site is macerated or malodorous. Higher-potency topical corticosteroids should be used with caution in occluded areas such as skin folds, as prolonged use may lead to adverse effects such as cutaneous atrophy.​[^[5]]

The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. These agents have also been used with success in patients with psoriasis of the fold areas (see Face: Pharmacologic Choices).​[^[5]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[14]] These agents can be particularly useful as longer-term maintenance therapy as they do not carry the risk of cutaneous atrophy that topical corticosteroids do.

The topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in fold areas. It has demonstrated efficacy and safety in treating psoriasis specifically at intertriginous sites.​[^[13]] 

Topical vitamin D analogues are another treatment option for intertriginous psoriasis. These agents have a favourable safety profile for long-term maintenance use.​[^[18]]

Once control is achieved with initial therapy, the frequency of application can be gradually reduced or discontinued. Maintenance application of a topical agent 2–3 times per week may be helpful in those with recurrent disease.

#### Nails

#### Introduction

Psoriatic nail changes can be difficult to differentiate from fungal infection of the nails. Typical changes seen in psoriasis include pitting of the nail plate, nail crumbling, onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages. Psoriatic nail changes are often more numerous and symmetrical than in onychomycosis, and psoriasis is often seen at other skin sites. If required, sampling of the nail for fungal culture can help differentiate between psoriasis and fungal nail infection. Fungal nail infection may also coexist with psoriatic nail changes.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Keep the nails short to decrease the risk of nail separation caused by trauma. Discourage aggressive manicures and pedicures.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Topical therapy is often unsatisfactory for nail psoriasis. Improvement has been demonstrated with the use of ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids and with topical tazarotene (after 12 wk of application under occlusion). Intralesional corticosteroid injection has also been used successfully, though the associated procedural pain often limits its use.​[^[5]]​[^[8]]​[^[14]] Information about systemic medications used in the treatment of nail psoriasis can be found in Table 4.

#### Severe or Treatment-Resistant Psoriasis

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

In patients with more extensive body surface area involvement and/or highly inflamed and thickened plaques, topical agents can be both onerous to apply and inadequately effective. Refer these patients and those in whom topical therapy has not provided satisfactory results to a dermatologist for further management including consideration of systemic agents.





**Intralesional corticosteroid** injections (e.g., triamcinolone) are used occasionally for localized, treatment-resistant psoriatic plaques.​[^[5]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Psoriasis and Pregnancy

Psoriasis often improves during pregnancy. In one study, 76% of patients reported either improvement or no change in their condition, whereas only 23% of patients reported worsening of their psoriasis during pregnancy.​[^[22]] The effect of psoriasis on pregnancy outcomes is unclear: studies have shown both adverse effects​[^[23]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]] and no effect.​[^[25]]​[^[27]] Pregnant patients with psoriasis may be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to comorbidities associated with psoriasis such as diabetes and obesity.​[^[3]]​[^[28]]

#### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

Methotrexate must be stopped at least 3 months prior to conception by both parents.​[^[29]] However, limited evidence does not show any adverse pregnancy or fetal outcomes after paternal low-dose methotrexate exposure near or during time of conception.​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]] It is recommended that patients taking acitretin avoid getting pregnant for 3 years after cessation of therapy.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] There is no standard waiting period before conception following treatment with acitretin in males. Limited studies indicate that there does not appear to be a risk of developmental toxicity due to paternal exposure​[^[17]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]]

#### Management of Psoriasis during Pregnancy

Many clinicians recommend that patients discontinue all unnecessary therapies during pregnancy, particularly if the disease is relatively mild. For patients with moderate to severe disease, this may not be practical, particularly if the disease is unstable or if psoriatic arthritis is present. If treatment is required, topical therapy is preferred.

Topical corticosteroids remain a core treatment option throughout pregnancy. Low- and moderate-potency corticosteroids are preferred.​[^[38]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] Anthralin and coal tar products have measurable levels of systemic absorption, but no adverse fetal effects have been reported.​[^[14]] Due to lack of evidence of safety and concerns of potential mutagenic effects, some recommend avoiding these products during pregnancy,​[^[42]] while others feel they are likely safe during the second and third trimesters.​[^[14]]​[^[38]] There is no theoretical reason for concern with the use of topical salicylic acid during pregnancy, but there is a lack of human data available.​[^[42]] Safety of topical vitamin D analogues (calcitriol, calcipotriol) has not been established; however, systemic absorption of topical calcipotriol is only 6% and unlikely to have significant effects.​[^[14]] Systemic retinoids are known teratogens. Safety of the topical retinoid tazarotene has not been documented and it is not recommended for use in pregnancy.​[^[43]] Topical roflumilast has not been studied in pregnancy, but animal studies using oral roflumilast have shown disruption in the labour and delivery process.​[^[44]]

**UVB phototherapy** is considered the safest treatment for widespread psoriasis during pregnancy that is not controlled with topical therapy.​[^[14]]​[^[45]] Methotrexate and acitretin are contraindicated in pregnancy (see Pre-pregnancy Considerations). Cyclosporine does not seem to be associated with adverse outcomes in the transplant patient population; reserve its use for severe cases and maintain at the minimal effective dose.​[^[29]]​[^[45]] Information about use of apremilast and deucravacitinib during pregnancy is limited and risk is difficult to assess.

Available evidence supports the safety of the TNF-alpha inhibitors during pregnancy.​[^[17]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]] Some degree of immunosuppression in the newborn due to placental transfer of antibodies, particularly in the third trimester, may be a concern with adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab;​[^[17]] however, certolizumab pegol has minimal to no placental transfer during the third trimester.​[^[48]] Information about use of other biologic agents (bimekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, tildrakizumab, ustekinumab) during pregnancy is limited and risk is difficult to assess.​[^[17]]​[^[49]]

#### Management of Psoriasis during Breastfeeding

As a general precaution, avoid direct contact of the infant’s skin with any area of the patient’s skin that has been treated with topical therapy. Avoid coal tar due to risk of absorption by the infant via skin-skin or skin-mouth contact.​[^[50]] Due to variability of systemic absorption of topical salicylic acid, it is not recommended while breastfeeding.​[^[51]] Risk to the baby via passage of topical corticosteroids into breast milk is unlikely, since only extensive use of the most potent agents causes systemic effects.​[^[50]]​[^[51]] No information on safety of the vitamin D analogues (calcitriol, calcipotriol) is available, though the low systemic absorption of calcipotriol is unlikely to pose any risk to the nursing infant.​[^[50]] Systemic absorption of tazarotene after topical use is minimal; the risk to a nursing infant via breast milk is considered low, though caution is recommended if used over large surface areas.​[^[51]] Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used safely as they have minimal systemic absorption.​[^[5]]​[^[50]] It is not known if topical roflumilast is transferred into breast milk in humans. If it is used during breastfeeding, minimize potential exposure to the infant by using on the smallest area possible for the shortest time period needed and avoid direct contact of the infant with the treated area.​[^[44]]

UVB phototherapy is a safe option for resistant or widespread disease.​[^[14]] Although transfer of acitretin and methotrexate into breast milk is low, avoid these medications while breastfeeding due to their inherent toxicity.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] Cyclosporine is transferred into breast milk in small amounts;​[^[50]] however, use in this setting is generally avoided.​[^[16]] It is not known whether apremilast or deucravacitinib are transferred into breast milk, and their use is not recommended in nursing patients. 

Studies of the TNF-alpha inhibitor certolizumab pegol have shown minimal to no transfer of the drug into breast milk and it is considered acceptable to use during breastfeeding by most experts and guidelines.​[^[50]] Due to their large molecular weight, it is unlikely that any of the other biologic agents are transferred into breast milk in significant amounts. Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are considered to be a low risk to a breastfeeding infant based on the information available. Caution is advised (especially with breastfeeding newborn or preterm infants) with bimekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab until more information is available.​[^[50]]​[^[51]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of mild to moderate localized plaque psoriasis. It provides a structured approach to treatment, including both nonpharmacologic measures and pharmacologic treatments based on the affected area.

### Title
- **Mild to moderate localized plaque psoriasis** (for severe/widespread or pustular psoriasis, refer to Dermatology)

### Nonpharmacologic Measures
- Frequent use of nonirritating, fragrance-free moisturizer
- Avoid friction/trauma to the affected areas
- Lifestyle: encourage smoking cessation, minimize alcohol consumption, maintain healthy BMI

### Treatment by Affected Area

#### Scalp
- Moderate- to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroid for 4–8 weeks initially
- Consider addition of salicylic acid or coal tar if significant scale
- If response is inadequate, consider addition of vitamin D analogue
- Lotion, solution, gel, or foam vehicles easier to apply

#### Hands and Feet
- Moderate- to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroid for 4–8 weeks initially (high- to ultra-high-potency often required on these thick-skinned areas)
- If response is inadequate, consider increasing strength of corticosteroid or combination therapy with salicylic acid, coal tar, tazarotene, or vitamin D analogue

#### Trunk and Extremities
- Moderate- to ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroid for 4–8 weeks initially
- Consider addition of salicylic acid if significant scale present
- If response is inadequate, consider increasing strength of corticosteroid or combination therapy with vitamin D analogue, tazarotene, coal tar, or roflumilast

#### Face and Skin Folds
- Initiate treatment with low-potency topical corticosteroid (e.g., hydrocortisone), topical calcineurin inhibitor, or topical roflumilast for 4–8 weeks
- Low- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroid may be used to treat flares for a short duration (2–4 weeks)
- Consider adding vitamin D analogue if response to hydrocortisone alone is inadequate
- Skin folds: consider adding topical azole antifungal if secondary Candida infection suspected
- Topical calcineurin inhibitors, vitamin D analogues, and roflumilast may be used for long-term maintenance on thinner skinned and/or occluded sites

### Outcomes

#### Unsatisfactory Improvement with Topical Therapy
- Refer to dermatologist for consideration of phototherapy where available (NB-UVB, PUVA) and/or systemic treatment
- Systemic nonbiologic agents: methotrexate, acitretin, apremilast, cyclosporine, deucravacitinib
- Systemic biologic agents: TNF-alpha inhibitors, IL 12/23 inhibitors, IL 17 inhibitors, IL 23 inhibitors (see Table 3)

#### Adequate Response to Topical Therapy
- Gradually reduce strength and/or frequency of topical applications and discontinue as tolerated
- Repeat initial treatment as above with flares
- If frequent flares, may consider maintenance application of previously effective topical therapy 2–3 times per week to usual areas of psoriasis

This flowchart provides a comprehensive guide for clinicians to manage mild to moderate localized plaque psoriasis, emphasizing both initial treatment and follow-up strategies based on patient response.
