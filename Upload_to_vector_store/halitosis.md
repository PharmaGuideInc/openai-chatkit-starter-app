#### Introduction

Halitosis, bad breath and oral malodor are all terms used to describe unpleasant or offensive odours emitted in the exhaled breath. In its simplest form, bad breath may be related to substances ingested such as herbs, spices, garlic, onion, tobacco or alcohol. With a reported prevalence as high as 50%, halitosis can be of great concern to many patients.​[^[1]] Given the growing interest, the diagnosis and treatment of halitosis are being incorporated into routine dental care, and specialized dental and multidisciplinary clinics are being set up solely for the treatment of patients with halitosis.​[^[2]]

#### Pathophysiology

Halitosis can be broadly classified into 3 main categories (see Figure 1). Genuine halitosis occurs when oral malodor is truly present. Pseudohalitosis occurs when oral malodor is of concern to the patient, but is not perceived by others. Halitophobia occurs when the patient believes halitosis is present, despite having received treatment for genuine halitosis or pseudohalitosis, while lacking any physical or social evidence for the presence of bad breath.​[^[1]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart detailing the classification of halitosis. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Halitosis** (Top Level)
   - The main condition being addressed.

2. **Branches from Halitosis**:
   - **Genuine**
     - Further divided into:
       - **Physiologic**
       - **Pathologic**
         - Subdivided into:
           - **Oral**
           - **Extraoral**
   - **Pseudohalitosis**
   - **Halitophobia**

This flowchart categorizes halitosis into genuine cases, pseudohalitosis, and halitophobia, with genuine halitosis further divided into physiologic and pathologic causes, and pathologic causes further classified as oral or extraoral.

Physiologic halitosis is primarily due to intraoral conditions that contribute to the buildup of gram negative and anaerobic bacteria, which play a role in the overproduction of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide and other malodorous gases. Intraoral conditions, e.g., periodontitis, that increase the depth of a periodontal pocket over time reduce oxygen tension, lower the pH and activate the decarboxylation of amino acids to malodorous diamines such as putrescine and cadaverine.​[^[3]] Bacteria and fungi can also build up with the prolonged entrapment of food particles in the mouth, particularly at the back of the tongue, giving rise to a coated tongue and the production of VSCs. This is more likely in situations where there is defective tooth restoration, misaligned teeth, prolonged night-time exposure to acrylic dentures, or poorly fitted dentures and dental prosthetics.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

Oral pathologic halitosis is caused by disease or malfunction of the oral tissues (e.g., gingivitis, dental abscess, pericoronitis, oral ulcers, stomatitis, intraoral neoplasia or jaw osteonecrosis), and includes halitosis due to periodontal disease and xerostomia (dry mouth). Xerostomia may be due to a number of factors, including insufficient water intake, breathing through the mouth, medication use (e.g., anticholinergic agents), excessive use of alcohol-based mouthwash, radiation therapy, chronic medical conditions (e.g., depression), smoking and regular caffeine intake.

Extraoral pathologic halitosis refers to malodor originating from sources other than the mouth. These may include the nasal, paranasal and laryngeal regions; the upper digestive tract (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease or Helicobacter pylori infection); the lungs; or disorders in any other body system (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hepatic cirrhosis, uremia, malignancy or internal bleeding). Nasal malodor is the most common origin of extraoral halitosis, and may be due to a nasal infection (e.g., sinusitis), problems affecting airflow or mucous secretions (e.g., polyps, postnasal drip) or craniofacial anomalies (e.g., cleft palate).​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

Pseudohalitosis and halitophobia may have a psychological component, which requires the expert advice of a mental health specialist for appropriate management.

There is no reliable way for people to properly assess their breath odour other than organoleptic (human nose) assessments. Some people have a lifelong concern with having bad breath, while at the other extreme, others do not seem to notice that their breath is offensive. Also, the perception of oral malodour differs among members of different cultures.​[^[6]]​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Patients seeking help for bad breath should be evaluated based on their personal, dental and medical history. Table 1 lists some common causes of bad breath to consider and Figure 2 provides a detailed patient assessment. Patients with halitosis, pseudohalitosis or halitophobia complicated by other medical conditions or symptoms require further assessment.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol | Alcohol use may contribute to halitosis. |
| Dental hygiene | Poor dental hygiene or discomfort in the mouth and oral cavity may signify pathology that requires treatment. |
| Denture hygiene | Improper denture hygiene may contribute to halitosis. |
| Diet | Certain foods (e.g., garlic, onions) are known to cause bad breath. |
| Dry mouth | Dry mouth contributes to bad breath. It is important to identify and treat its cause if patients experience frequent dry mouth (see Dry Mouth). |
| Mouthwash | The long-term use of mouthwashes with alcohol content or antibacterial agents can contribute to halitosis. |
| Time of day | Bad breath is common upon awakening. |
| Time of meals | Irregular eating can lead to ketosis​[a] and bad breath. |
| Tobacco | Tobacco use may contribute to halitosis. |


#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

The oral cavity is the source of bad breath in the majority of patients, and good oral hygiene along with the treatment of any periodontal or oral disease is necessary to resolve the problem. Encourage patients to visit a dental care professional for assessment of oral diseases and for removal of dental plaque and accumulated bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue and in the periodontal pockets. Encourage tooth brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush at least twice a day and daily flossing.​[^[9]]

A clean tongue is a healthy pink colour. A whitish haze on the tongue can indicate bacterial or fungal buildup.​[^[10]] Cleaning the tongue along with other oral hygiene measures may be helpful in decreasing physiologic halitosis.​[^[10]] Tongue cleaning can be accomplished by using a specially designed tongue cleaner or tongue scraper, or through the use of a soft, small-headed, child-size toothbrush (adult toothbrushes are more difficult to tolerate).​[^[11]] The tongue is stroked from the back to the tip with the brush or cleaner, then the mouth is rinsed with water. The posterior portion of the tongue is the most important area to clean, but care should be taken to minimize gagging.

It is important for patients to understand that they should not be overzealous in their cleaning, to avoid causing damage to and bleeding from the tongue’s surface. Tongue scrapers and adult toothbrushes must be used cautiously for tongue cleaning.​[^[1]] Cleaning the tongue with either a cleaner or a scraper may reduce VSC levels more than by cleaning with a toothbrush;​[^[10]] however, this reduction in VSC levels may not be long-lasting.​[^[10]]

Drinking plenty of fluids and cleaning the mouth after consuming dairy products, meat or fish are adjunctive measures for treating bad breath.​[^[12]] Saliva has many functions in keeping the mouth healthy, including lubrication, oxygenation, buffering and antimicrobial action. Increasing saliva flow and tongue action helps decrease bad breath; chewing sugarless gum and snacking on fibrous vegetables, such as raw carrots and celery, can help accomplish this.​[^[10]]​[^[13]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

#### Mouthwashes

Mouthwashes may supplement oral hygiene. Regular use of a mouthwash may reduce bad breath, but single-use mouthwashes may have only a short-term benefit.​[^[14]] Most commercial mouthwashes mask odours and provide antiseptic properties for a relatively short time (<30 minutes).​[^[7]] Rinsing with water is of little help because water offers no antiseptic properties and it can wash away saliva, which does have these properties.​[^[10]] The action of mouthwashes is optimized when deeply gargled (in addition to rinsing) prior to going to bed. Residues of the oral rinse may remain in the mouth longer during sleep, as the individual is not eating or drinking; this is also the time when bacterial activity is at its highest due to decreased salivary flow.​[^[15]] The quality of the available evidence supporting the effectiveness of mouthwashes is low, due to sparse data and various methodological flaws (e.g., diversity in the baseline characteristics of the participants and the methods used to assess outcomes).​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]

Chlorhexidine **0.12%** mouthwash appears to be effective in reducing oral malodor by exerting its antibacterial activity on supragingival plaque and the tongue. It is a prescription product; side effects include taste disturbances and tooth staining (reversible).​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Chlorhexidine mouthwash is not recommended to be used for more than 1 week at a time and should be discontinued if mouth ulcers are present. If halitosis recurs, patients may try another mouthwash or repeat another week of chlorhexidine therapy.

Regular use of cetylpyridinium-containing mouthwashes may reduce bad breath at 2–4 weeks. Cetylpyridinium has an antimicrobial effect against VSC-producing bacteria.​[^[14]]

Zinc-containing mouthwashes (e.g., zinc chloride) may be effective in neutralizing odoriferous sulphur compounds. It is thought that zinc may transform volatile sulphur compounds into non-odoriferous breakdown products. Enhanced efficacy may be seen at concentrations ≥1%.​[^[17]]

Povidone iodine **1.0%** mouthwash has antibacterial properties and may reduce the bacteria that cause bad breath. It should be avoided in patients with thyroid disorder and in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]]

Mouthwashes containing **essential oils** (e.g., eucalyptol) may be successful in reducing moderate malodor.​[^[16]]

While not available in Canada, mouthwashes containing chlorine dioxide, zinc lactate or combinations of chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium and zinc have demonstrated effectiveness on VSC levels in clinical trials.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Mouth Products: Mouthwashes.

#### Additional Agents

A potential role may exist for agents such as triclosan, hydrogen peroxide, dehydroascorbic acid, sodium bicarbonate, iminium, allylpyrocatechol, L-trifluoromethionine and medications used for H. pylori eradication in the treatment of halitosis.​[^[17]] Further large, well-designed, randomized controlled trials that examine the long-term use of these agents are required to identify their role in the management of halitosis.

#### Natural Health Products

**Chlorophyll**, **parsley**, **menthol** and **mint** have been known as breath fresheners for many years. ***Garcinia mangostana*** (mangosteen) may also play a role in reducing VSC levels; however, there is insufficient reliable evidence supporting regular use of these products for the management of halitosis.​[^[17]]​[^[25]] 

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Health Products: Combinations, Single Entity.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

After 1 week of practising good oral hygiene, including gentle cleaning of the tongue, the patient should see an improvement in their bad breath; this routine should be continued. If the patient’s tongue hurts or bleeds following cleaning, or if tongue cleaning causes excessive gagging, it is likely that further instruction on tongue cleaning is required. Dentists and dental hygienists may be best situated to give these instructions.

Mouthwashes containing antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium may stain the teeth. Zinc-containing mouthwashes may cause a metallic taste in the mouth. Products containing alcohol may cause dryness with long-term use, which can exacerbate bad breath. Monitor the duration of use of these products when possible, and discourage regular use of products containing alcohol or antibacterial agents.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to assess and manage halitosis (bad breath). Here is a detailed description of its contents:

### Initial Assessment
- **Patient presents with halitosis. Are any of the following true?**
  - Patient has painful, red, swollen areas around the gums or tongue, or a pus-filled area within the mouth (indicating possible candidiasis, bacterial infection, or gingivitis).
  - Patient has recently had a dental extraction or other dental surgery.
  - **Yes:** Further assessment required, ideally by a dental professional.
  - **No:** Proceed to the next assessment.

### Secondary Assessment
- **Are any of the following true?**
  - Patient has symptoms of respiratory disease, sinusitis, tonsillitis, rhinitis, or any other potentially contributing medical condition.
  - Patient is concerned about bad breath, but friends and family do not share this concern.
  - **Yes:** Further assessment required.
  - **No:** Proceed to the next set of questions.

### Behavioral and Lifestyle Assessment
- **Does the patient:**
  - Eat garlic or spicy foods?
  - Eat irregular meals (hunger ketosis)?
  - Consume alcohol or caffeine on a regular basis?
  - Smoke tobacco or use smokeless tobacco?
  - Go to sleep at night without removing dentures?
  - Have poor denture or oral hygiene?
  - Use a mouthwash containing alcohol or an antibacterial agent regularly?
  - Require a dental checkup and cleaning (has not seen the dentist in the past 12 months)?
  - Wake up in the morning with a dry mouth and bad breath?
  - Experience frequent dry mouth due to medications or other causes? (Note: a specific reference is made to a footnote "a" which is not visible in the image)
  - **Yes to 1 or more questions:** Follow the recommendations below.
  - **No:** Further assessment required.

### Recommendations
- Recommend avoiding potential causes (e.g., specific foods, tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, delaying meals, leaving dentures in the mouth while sleeping).
- Recommend practicing good oral hygiene (including good denture hygiene, if applicable) and having regular dental checkups.
- Recommend cleaning the tongue gently with a soft child-size toothbrush.
- If the patient wishes to try a mouth rinse, recommend a product containing cetylpyridinium, zinc, or essential oils, or any combination of these ingredients with the lowest available alcohol content, at bedtime for a 1-week trial. Chlorhexidine mouth rinses may also be provided through a prescription. Advise about potential side effects (e.g., tooth staining with chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium).
- Discourage long-term use of mouth rinses with high alcohol content or antibacterial agents.
- If medication is the likely cause of dry mouth and resulting bad breath, assess for potential adjustment of the medication and rule out other possible causes.
- Provide a patient information sheet with helpful reminders for the patient to follow.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to identifying potential causes of halitosis and offers recommendations for management and further assessment.
