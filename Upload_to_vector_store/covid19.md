#### Introduction



In the community setting, advise all patients with symptoms or those who have questions about COVID-19 testing and isolation to contact their **local public health unit** for up-to-date recommendations. Remind patients who are planning to see a health-care provider for any other health-related concern during the pandemic to call ahead and confirm instructions about office or clinic procedures.



#### Clinical Presentation

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines the spectrum of COVID-19 severities as follows:​[^[2]]



Patients may progress quickly from one category to the next and should be advised of the need to seek medical attention when symptoms worsen or progress. Some clinics supply patients with home oxygen monitors to facilitate early detection of clinical deterioration.​[^[4]]

The following risk factors increase the likelihood of symptomatic disease and progression to critical illness:​[^[5]]



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Community-Based Management

Many patients with mild illness may not contact their primary health-care provider and will only seek symptom alleviation, usually through cough and cold medications available from pharmacies. Sore throat, cough and congestion relief along with triage for more severe symptoms is frequently managed by primary health-care providers and community-practice based pharmacists. For more information on management of mild symptoms, see Acute Bronchitis, Viral Pharyngitis and Viral Rhinitis.

When managing patients in the acute phase of infection, the following criteria may be used to establish suitability for community-based care:​[^[4]]





#### Initial Assessment and Follow-Up

Assessment and follow-up after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis includes monitoring for:



Based on clinical assessment, patients can continue to be managed at home with regular follow-up at intervals determined by the primary-care provider. For most patients, telehealth visits, if available, at days 4, 7 and 10 after onset of symptoms is reasonable. Patients >65 years of age, those with risk factors for more severe disease and those with moderate dyspnea at time of first evaluation may benefit from more frequent follow-up; consideration should be given to scheduling visits within the first 24 hours and every 24–48 hours thereafter, until symptom resolution. If there is evidence of clinical deterioration, follow-up may increase in frequency or arrangements may be made to transfer patient to an acute-care setting (as per the red flags identified above).​[^[4]]

 Even if mildly ill, **patients at high risk for severe disease** may be eligible for several treatment options. For more information about treatments, see Therapeutic Choices.

Ongoing follow-up for development of post COVID-19 condition is warranted, as these symptoms may manifest weeks after resolution of acute symptoms.​[^[7]] See Post COVID-19 Condition (Long COVID).

A number of institutions and health regions, as seen with the COVID tool kit,​[^[6]] have established outpatient management algorithms and tools to aid virtual clinical assessment and triage.

#### Management and Follow-Up of Hospitalized Patients Postdischarge

Once a patient is medically well and not on oxygen (unless previously on home oxygen), they can be discharged from hospital to an appropriate community setting. When patients are discharged back to their home, either alone or with family, they should have routine follow-up with their primary-care provider or, if available, a dedicated COVID-19 clinic. Discharge from hospital care discussions should take place in collaboration with the primary-care provider and/or community of care as well as the local public health unit as appropriate.

Ensure that the patient’s individual context, including access to transportation, living situation and family/household support, is taken into consideration when deciding when and how to discharge.

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are at risk of complications and should have routine follow-up at least 4 weeks after initial recovery or sooner if deemed necessary based on functional status, living arrangements and social supports. Older people are more likely to experience pronounced functional decline and may require coordinated rehabilitation or convalescent care.

Patients who are discharged from hospital on new medications for COVID-19–related complications, such as antithrombotics for pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis, should be managed as per standard practice. For more information, see Venous Thromboembolism.

#### Mental Health

Among patients with COVID-19, there may be heightened levels of both new and worsening anxiety (see Anxiety Disorders), depression (see Depression), substance use disorder (see Alcohol-Related Disorders and Opioid-Related Disorders) and PTSD (see Post-traumatic Stress Disorder).

The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health has published resources for health-care providers for self- and patient-centred mental health support.

#### Post COVID-19 Condition (Long COVID)

Many patients report long-term health effects that may persist for months after recovering from acute COVID-19. It can also manifest weeks after resolution of acute symptoms.​[^[7]] The Public Health Agency of Canada defines post COVID-19 condition as symptoms of COVID-19 that persist for more than 12 weeks after infection.​[^[1]] The pathology, epidemiology and risk factors for prolonged COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated, and evidence is still emerging.



These findings are consistent with other similar studies as well as international evidence. More than 100 symptoms of post COVID-19 condition have been reported;​[^[10]] the most common ones are:​[^[9]]​[^[10]]



Individuals may complain of 1 or many of these symptoms. It should be noted that this list is not exhaustive, and other symptoms that have been less-frequently reported may be present. 

Routine follow-up instructions include self-monitoring for any of these symptoms or any symptoms that were not present prior to onset of illness that reflect a less than full return to baseline function. Questions related to return to activities, mobility and independence are important to identify long-term complications of COVID-19. In older patients, potential signs of ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post COVID-19 condition include descriptions of gradual or ongoing decline in function, persistent deconditioning, worsening frailty, new or worsening dementia, and loss of interest in eating or drinking.

Supportive or symptomatic management (e.g., headache relief) may be all that is necessary for many of these symptoms, but rehabilitation or referral for further assessment may be required. During follow-up, screening questions for severe hypoxia or significant oxygen desaturation while exercising, chest pain, or severe lung disease will identify individuals who require further assessment. In pediatric patients, symptoms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome should be further investigated. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is unclear at this time. Practitioners are cautioned to avoid dismissing patient complaints or considering them to be predominantly associated with mental health; evidence of organ damage has been described with long-term consequences and is still being explored.

The availability of resources for patients with post COVID-19 condition, including support groups and dedicated clinics, continues to grow and may vary by region. Check with your local public health unit.

#### Prevention

Vaccination is currently the preferred pharmacologic measure for prevention of COVID-19; see Vaccination against COVID–19. In persons who cannot be vaccinated or specific immunocompromised populations who cannot mount an adequate immune response, pre-exposure prophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody combination may be an option; see Chemoprophylaxis. There is no evidence that any vitamin or herbal supplement is effective in the prevention of the disease. Several prevention trials are ongoing (see *Government of Canada, Vaccines and treatments for COVID-19: List of all COVID-19 clinical trials authorized by Health Canada*).

For more information on prevention, see *Health Canada: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): prevention and risks*. An infographic specifically for patients on the prevention of virus spread has been created by the Canadian Pharmacists Association and is available from www.pharmacists.ca [search: awareness resources, then choose COVID-19 awareness resources > posters and handouts > top tips to prevent the spread of viruses].

#### Vaccination against COVID–19

For a list of available vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, see Table 1. 

COVID-19 immunization for all eligible persons is strongly recommended by public health units in all Canadian jurisdictions. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that individuals with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should still be vaccinated in order to maximize their immune response.​[^[12]] Guidance for time intervals between infection and COVID-19 vaccination (primary or booster doses) in certain populations are also provided.​[^[12]] Patients should not seek immunization during an active COVID-19 infection in order to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus at a clinic and to ensure that symptoms are not confused with adverse effects of the vaccine. The current recommendation is for a booster dose at least 6 months after a previous vaccine dose or a known SARS-CoV-2 infection; whichever came later.

Dosing for all vaccines is initiated with a 1- or 2-dose primary schedule. The primary series is followed by booster dose(s) in adults, youth and children ≥5 years of age. Vaccine recommendations are frequently updated, and all health-care providers are strongly encouraged to watch for updates from NACI and local public health agencies.​[^[12]] See Table 1 and Table 2 for more information.

 Health Canada’s website is an up-to-date resource for information on COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada. Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness may be impacted as variants of concern emerge and circulate globally.



Patients and caregivers may have questions about the difference between COVID-19 vaccines, their expected side effects and other risks. Many excellent resources for frequently asked questions are available on provincial and regional websites (e.g., Ottawa Public Health’s Frequently asked questions about COVID-19 vaccination). Some resources address questions about vaccinating children (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines from the Hospital for Sick Children).

#### Chemoprophylaxis

When vaccination is not an option, some individuals may be eligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis with a combination therapy of tixagevimab/​cilgavimab, 2 long-acting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Target candidates are those who have been advised that they should not receive a COVID-19 vaccination or are immunocompromised and unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to the vaccine. Furthermore, patients must be ≥12 years of age, weigh ≥40 kg and have no known recent exposure to a person infected with SARS-CoV-2. The current recommended regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis is tixagevimab 300 mg and cilgavimab 300 mg sequentially administered by IM injection for a total dose of 600 mg. Patients who received 300 mg (150 mg of each monoclonal antibody) should receive the higher dose regimen at a minimum of 3 months post first dose. Ongoing prevention doses of 600 mg are given at an increment of every 6 months. See also Table 3. Certain variants of SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated resistance to prophylaxis or treatment with tixagevimab/​cilgavimab and patients should be educated on the risk of breakthrough infections.​[^[16]] In fact, the US Food and Drug Administration recently revised the emergency use regulations for tixagevimab, /cilgavimab. Currently, it is not authorized for use in the US as it is estimated that more than 90% of current SARS-CoV-2 circulating strains are resistant to this agent, thus rendering the drug ineffective in prevention and treatment.​[^[17]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

Guidance on the treatment of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 is available from:



In the outpatient setting, treatment for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms is usually supportive and based on the provider’s assessment of the patient’s clinical condition. For patients being cared for or recovering at home, standard treatment for cold-like symptoms and influenza-like illness is recommended. For management of fever and pain, both acetaminophen and **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs** **(**NSAIDs**)** are equally effective and considered safe choices.​[^[18]] Similarly, patients who regularly take an NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid may continue to do so as previously directed.



An infographic from the Canadian Pharmacists Association, *Managing COVID-19 at home*, containing this information for patients is also available from www.pharmacists.ca [search: awareness resources, then choose COVID-19 awareness resources > posters and handouts > managing COVID-19 at home]. 





Dexamethasone (or an equivalent corticosteroid) is *not* indicated for patients with COVID-19 who are not admitted to hospital, unless indicated for another condition (e.g., asthma exacerbation). Corticosteroid therapy is routinely indicated for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Dexamethasone is administered IV or PO at doses of 6 mg in adults or 0.15 mg/kg (up to 6 mg) in children for 10 days or until discharge, whichever is sooner.​[^[19]] 

For hospitalized patients, continuation of prophylactic antithrombotics post discharge for COVID-19 is not recommended. Furthermore, antithrombotic therapy has not demonstrated benefit in outpatient management of COVID-19.

Investigation of other pharmacological options is ongoing and the reader is directed to refer to a reliable source of frequently updated information such as *Health Canada: Drug and vaccine authorizations for COVID-19: List of authorized drugs, vaccines and expanded indications*.

#### Approved and Experimental Therapies for Acute COVID–19

Information, including links to product monographs, for those agents approved in Canada for the management of COVID-19 can be found on the Health Canada’s list of authorized drugs, vaccines and expanded indications.

 A few antivirals or monoclonal antibodies have received Emergency Use Authorization and may be considered based on clinical circumstances and availability (e.g.,bamlanivimab, casirivimab/​imdevimab, remdesivir, sotrovimab). However, due to their lack of effectiveness against the Omicron variant, casirivimab/​imdevimab and sotrovimab are not currently recommended.​[^[19]]​[^[23]] Recommendations and evidence-based decisions on place in therapy for these agents will change as new data emerges. It is important to identify reliable, evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings. Many such provincial and regional evidence-based resources exist (e.g., Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, BC Centre for Disease Control Clinical Resources for Health Professionals).

Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 inhibitor marketed in Canada. It is indicated for the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.​[^[31]]

Other experimental therapies have been used to prevent progression or spread of the disease in severely ill patients in the acute-care setting, in mild or moderate illness, or in uninfected patients. Any use of these medications for these purposes outside of a clinical trial or the advice of an infectious disease specialist is inappropriate.



The following agents have not demonstrated clinically significant benefit in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19: azithromycin, chloroquine, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, interferons, ivermectin lopinavir/ritonavir, rifampin, vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc.

#### Special Populations

#### Pediatrics

Most children with COVID-19 can be managed at home with supportive care.​[^[32]]



For treatment of fever in pediatric patients, see Fever.

##### Post COVID-19 Condition (Long COVID) in Children



An uncommon post COVID-19 infection complication in children is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). It appears 2–6 weeks after infection and, although rare, clinicians should be aware of this potential complication. Important signs and symptoms of MIS-C include the following:



Immediate medical attention is needed if the child is experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms: severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, cyanosis of lips/face, neurologic findings of confusion, or altered level of consciousness.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancy

Although pregnant individuals are not at higher risk for COVID-19, the risk of developing severe disease is greater compared to nonpregnant patients of the same age.​[^[34]]​[^[35]] In general, most babies of patients who have COVID-19 are born healthy at term; however, there is an increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit.​[^[34]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]] Risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy include asthma, diabetes, obesity, advanced maternal age, hypertension and heart disease.​[^[34]]

Vertical transmission of COVID-19 is a rare event.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] There is, however, a risk of person-to-person transmission to the newborn;​[^[35]] therefore, all babies born to patients with confirmed COVID-19 should be tested for SARS CoV-2 within 24 hours of delivery.​[^[40]]

#### COVID-19 Infection in Breastfeeding

Although current information is limited, it is unlikely that COVID-19 is transmitted via breast milk.​[^[35]] It is recommended that individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 continue to breastfeed their infant if they are able, taking appropriate precautions while doing so.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] If an individual is too ill to breastfeed, they may choose to use a breast pump.​[^[41]] Appropriate precautions include:​[^[40]]



#### Prevention of COVID-19

Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should be offered vaccination against COVID-19 (primary series and/or booster doses) at any time during pregnancy if they are eligible and no other contraindications exist.​[^[12]]​[^[43]] As with all patients, informed consent of the pregnant individual should include a discussion of the risks and symptoms of adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines.​[^[12]] Enrolment in COVID-19 vaccine registries is encouraged for anyone who receives these vaccines during pregnancy.​[^[12]] 

COVID-19 vaccination is safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. The rates of local and systemic adverse effects to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are the same as those in the general population. No increase in adverse birth outcomes (e.g., miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, NICU admission) have been observed. Vaccination of the breastfeeding individual did not affect milk production or excretion.​[^[37]]

More studies are needed to determine if tixagevimab/cilgavimab can be safely used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. The drug should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to patient and fetus or the breastfeeding infant.

#### Treatment of COVID-19

Information on the safety of approved and investigational therapies is listed below:​[^[44]]​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]





A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
