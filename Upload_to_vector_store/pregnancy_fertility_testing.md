#### Pregnancy Testing

#### Introduction

For an overview of the reproductive cycle, see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods.

Once an ovum is fertilized, it takes an average of 9 days (6–12 days) before it is implanted in the endometrium.​[^[1]] Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is detectable in the blood and urine once the ovum is fertilized and implanted. In healthy people, hCG is a specific marker for pregnancy because it is produced only by the placenta.

The hormone hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the trophoblasts of the placenta and maintains the corpus luteum. It replaces luteinizing hormone (LH) and can be detected as soon as 6–8 days after conception. Its concentration in the blood is highest between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. and doubles about every 2 days, reaching a peak in 60–70 days. It then decreases to a lower level for the rest of the pregnancy. The half-life of hCG is about 5.6 hours. Following parturition, it returns to baseline within 10 days. The detection of hCG is the basis of pregnancy testing kits.​[^[3]]

Initial pregnancy tests can be performed on urine samples and later confirmed with a blood test. Detectable hCG levels start at 5 mIU/mL during the first week of gestation and rise to a peak of about 100 000 mIU/mL.​[^[3]] Blood tests can detect levels as low as 1 mIU/mL and most urine tests are able to detect 20–100 mIU/mL.

Prior to the advent of a biological assay for hCG, pregnancy tests were performed by injecting a person’s urine into a female rabbit. After 5 days, the rabbit was sacrificed and its uterus examined. Since hCG causes swelling of the corpus luteum and of the uterus, a heavy/enlarged rabbit’s uterus meant that the person was most likely pregnant.

In the 1960s, immunoassay technology allowed synthesis of an antibody that combined with hCG to produce a precipitant or change a coloured substrate. First-generation tests used polyclonal antibodies, which recognized multiple binding sites on hCG but also reacted with other substances such as LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in false-positive results. While second-generation tests employ monoclonal antibody technology and are more specific than first-generation tests, they have been replaced by third-generation tests in which the technology is even more refined. The tests available today for home use are third-generation tests.

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Home Testing Products: Pregnancy Tests.

#### Third-Generation Tests

The pregnancy testing kits in use today represent the third generation of pregnancy testing technology. One anti-beta-subunit hCG monoclonal antibody is linked to a coloured substrate. If present, hCG binds to this antibody and the resulting complex binds to a second monoclonal antibody bound to a solid surface. The second monoclonal antibody is the alpha-subunit and elicits the colour change. Ease of use and accuracy are significant advantages of third-generation tests, so much so that one American study estimates that one-third of people in the United States wanting to confirm their pregnancy status have used them.​[^[4]] 

Pregnancy testing kits afford early detection of pregnancy in privacy, and earlier detection can permit earlier prenatal care.​[^[6]] They also enable earlier avoidance of harmful chemicals, x-rays, drugs and elective surgery, all of which could potentially harm a developing fetus. The tests are easy to use and readily available with numerous generic versions. They offer speed, convenience and confidentiality at a reasonable cost. 

Of note are the semi-quantitative pregnancy tests that are used in medical offices that test for 5 different hCG levels (25, 100, 500, 2000 and 10 000 mIU/mL). They are intended for professional use only and may be part of a pregnancy termination protocol; however, they can be purchased online.​[^[5]]

#### Proper Use

It is important to carefully follow the manufacturers’ instructions for the specific pregnancy test being used. There may be variations among tests such as the method for collecting the urine, the length of time required to apply urine to the test stick or the symbols used to communicate test results. It is recommended to test at least 1 day after a missed period; however, with increasing sensitivity, some pregnancy tests are promoted as being able to detect hCG as early as 6 days before a missed period, or 5 days prior to an expected period.​[^[7]] False negative test results are more likely to occur during this earlier time frame (e.g., testing 4 days before the expected period can detect a pregnancy in only 51% of pregnant people). The first urine of the morning has the highest concentration of hCG and is the recommended sample. It is advisable to collect the urine midstream to avoid contamination of the sample. In general, urine is either collected in a small plastic cup or directly applied to a testing stick during urination. If urine is collected in a cup, a dropper is used to place a small amount of urine on the test, or the absorbent end of a test stick is placed into the cup for a specified amount of time. If urine is directly applied to a test stick during urination, it is important to place the absorbent end of the stick into the urine stream for the specified amount of time, e.g., 5 seconds. Once the urine has been applied, the test should be placed on a clean, level surface with the result window facing up for the required amount of time indicated in the instructions. Most third-generation tests have control windows to indicate whether the test was performed correctly. Once the specified testing time has elapsed, the control window can confirm whether a successful test has occurred and the test result can be read. A test is considered positive even if the indicator line or symbol is very faint, as it confirms hCG was detected in the urine.

False-positive and false-negative results are possible regardless of which generation of test is used. Human error (e.g., holding the wrong end of the test stick in urine stream, exposing the test stick to the urine for less than the required length of time) is usually the cause of erroneous results. The easier a test is to use, the less likely errors will occur. 

Timing of the pregnancy test is essential in that accuracy is more closely related to ovulation than to intercourse. Sperm can remain viable in the fallopian tubes up to 5 days after vaginal intercourse and implantation takes an additional 6–12 days after ovulation (and subsequent fertilization). Therefore, false-negative results are possible up to 17 days after vaginal intercourse.

Other errors leading to false results include:



Many pregnancy testing kits are purported to be 99% accurate and able to detect pregnancy as early as the first day of a missed period; however, a study showed that of 7 testing kits, only 2 would have detected 95% and 80% of pregnancies on the first day of the missed period.​[^[8]] Caution is required when interpreting pregnancy test results. In case of negative results, some pregnancy testing kits recommend testing again in 1–2 weeks.

#### Methods Used to Predict Ovulation

Table 1 compares various methods of predicting the time of ovulation, including prediction methods other than those that are hormone-based.

| Test | Indicators of Ovulation |
| --- | --- |
| Basal body temperature | Elevation of basal temperature (0.5°F or 0.28°C) over up to 3 days, lasting at least 11 days, usually continuing to day 1 of menses​[9]​[10] |
| Cervical mucus | Abundant watery discharge; clear, elastic and stretchable mucus (tested with fingers); changes occur about 3–4 days prior to ovulation​[9] |
| Chloride ion | Chloride ion levels increase about 6 days prior to ovulation (device is a wrist band with a microcomputer chip that detects chloride ions in perspiration on the skin).​[12] This test is not sold in Canada |
| Endometrial biopsy (late luteal phase) | Histology within 2 days of chronological cycle day based on LH surge​[2] |
| Menstrual cycle history | Most cycles are 26–30 days (range 23–35 days) with ovulation mid-cycle, e.g., around day 14 for a 28-day cycle. The postovulatory phase is usually more likely to be consistently around 14 days, e.g., in a 35-day cycle, ovulation might occur around day 21​[10] |
| Midluteal serum progesterone | Values greater than 5 ng/mL​[11] |
| Saliva | Fern-like pattern on glass; changes occur about 3–4 days prior to ovulation (saliva is licked on a slide, which then is examined under a microscope)​[9] |
| Urinary LH kits (ovulation prediction kits) | Colour change 20–48 h before ovulation;​[13] specific time range is product-dependent |

#### Basal Thermometers

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Home Testing Products: Thermometers.

Basal body temperature is the temperature that occurs prior to rising in the morning. It can be taken orally, rectally or vaginally but must be consistently measured the same way and at the same time each day. A basal thermometer measures a more narrow range of temperatures than a fever thermometer (36–38°C or 96–99°F) and is able to detect small fluctuations in the basal temperature. Basal thermometers are easier to read than fever thermometers, and digital versions measuring to 2 decimal points may be even more user-friendly.

Electronic basal thermometers combine data about menstrual cycle history with the measured temperatures to provide information about the timing of fertility. A fertility bracelet worn continually not only tracks temperature, but also other physiological parameters like stress, sleep and heart rate. The bracelet is synchronized with an online application and provides an overview of fertility.​[^[14]]

Progesterone is thermogenic; elevated levels cause a rise in body temperature. About 12–24 hours prior to ovulation, a drop in temperature occurs; however, it is not always possible to detect the drop. When ovulation occurs, the corpus luteum releases progesterone, causing a significant rise in temperature that is detectable and lasts for several days. The temperature increase is about 0.5°F or 0.28°C and is measurable by a basal thermometer.​[^[15]] This temperature rise occurs over a period of up to 3 days and is usually maintained until the first day of menses—day 1 of the next cycle. It is not the temperature itself that is significant, but the maintained high temperature. The person records their basal temperatures daily on a graph. With several cycles of data, a pattern may emerge, i.e., the usual day of ovulation in the cycle.​[^[9]]​[^[10]]

To be relevant, the basal body temperature needs to be measured in a consistent manner. Sleep disturbances can affect the temperature, and at least 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep is required before taking the temperature. Air travel, especially with a change in time zones, and jet lag can adversely affect the measurement, as can any factor that may on its own impact temperature, e.g., alcohol consumption, stress, anxiety or illness, including infections.

Being able to identify a rise in temperature enables a person to determine when they are most fertile and likely to conceive. Vaginal intercourse (ideally every 2 days) during this time will increase the chance of conception. Conversely, a person will also know when to avoid intercourse if they do not want to conceive. For more information on contraception, see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods.

Some people learn to use symptothermal charting, which combines symptoms (e.g., mucus, pain, breast tenderness, spotting) and basal body temperatures, allowing the fertile period to be more accurately pinpointed.

#### Ovulation Prediction Kits

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Home Testing Products: Fertility Test Kits.

Ovulation prediction kits are not intended to be used as contraception.

#### Urine-Based Kits

While basal thermometers identify the rise in temperature that accompanies progesterone release, ovulation prediction tests identify the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation by measuring its concentration in the urine. Conception is most likely to occur within 36 hours following the LH surge; therefore, a positive ovulation prediction test identifies the most fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.​[^[16]]

These tests employ polyclonal and monoclonal antibody technology. One antibody is bound to a test surface and another to an enzyme. If LH is present, it becomes sandwiched between the 2 antibodies and produces a colour change on the test surface. With no LH in the urine, the second antibody bound to the enzyme is washed away and no colour change occurs. The colour intensity depends upon the amount of LH present.

Most ovulation tests are mixtures of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antibodies may bind with either the alpha- or beta-subunit of LH or even the entire molecule. The monoclonal antibodies are usually specific for the beta-subunit, which is a more accurate identifier of LH.​[^[17]]

More recently, tests are beta-subunit–specific antibodies bound to coloured latex particles. The second monoclonal antibody is bound to the test surface. Without LH, the antibody bound to the coloured latex is washed away.

Usually kits contain 5 daily tests that require 3–60 minutes each to perform. Using the average length of their cycle, the person uses a chart to determine the day of the cycle on which they should begin testing. Some test results are compared with baseline colour charts, some to the previous test and others to a control window. These tests can detect LH surges accurately (up to 98.3% accurate) if performed properly.​[^[18]]

Because of its effects on estrogen levels, patients taking letrozole should not start testing for the LH surge until 3 days after taking their last tablet; otherwise, the test may not accurately indicate the peak fertility time.

#### Fertility Monitors

Fertility testing technology has advanced to include monitors containing software programs that more specifically pinpoint fertility. These test kits combine the use of monitors with urine testing. The kits contain from 5–20 urine tests and the software program tracks the cycle day, indicating when a urine test should be performed. It usually reports the degree of fertility as low, high or peak.

These advanced tests use monoclonal technology and not only test for LH, but also for estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), which is a urinary metabolite of estradiol. Estradiol stimulates the secretion of cervical mucus that is favourable for the survival and transport of sperm. The rise in estradiol levels corresponds to the appearance of sperm-supportive cervical mucus. Estradiol levels gradually rise in the early stage of the cycle, reaching a threshold that triggers the LH surge. With these tests, the stick is not read visually, but is inserted into the monitor, which optically reads the test and displays the result.​[^[19]] 

These monitors are generally considered reliable and accurate. One manufacturer reported that in 97% of ovulatory cycles, ultrasound-confirmed ovulation occurred within the first 2 days of the monitor’s reported peak-fertility days.​[^[20]] For all of these kits, urine should be collected at the same time each day, and while some tests are to be done on the first urine in the morning, others can be performed anytime during the day as long as there is a sufficient volume to ensure an effective concentration of LH. Human error accounts for the majority of false readings. The inclusion of test controls and comparison of the results to the previous days’ results reduce the chance of errors.

Test results can be affected by tetracycline and other drugs that affect the menstrual cycle such as hormonal contraceptives, fertility treatments that contain hCG or LH, and hormone therapy. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, polycystic ovary syndrome and menopause may also affect results.​[^[13]] After pregnancy, breastfeeding or discontinuation of hormonal contraceptives or other hormonal therapy, 2 consecutive menstrual cycles are required before a person can accurately test for LH surge. 

#### Saliva-Based Kits

Saliva-based testing detects a fern-like pattern in dried saliva seen under a microscope at a 40–60× magnification. Prior to ovulation, estrogen levels rise causing an increase in the salinity of saliva, which produces fern-like patterns when the saliva is dried. Testing is recommended to be performed first thing in the morning before eating, drinking, smoking or brushing the teeth. The saliva sample needs to be dried for at least 5 minutes, and bubbles in the sample should be avoided. While the fern-like patterns are usually seen 3–4 days prior to ovulation, daily testing is sometimes recommended to detect changes. Note that not all saliva produces a fern-like pattern, and not all people are able to recognize this pattern. Reports on the sensitivity of and usability of these kits are inconsistent. One study noted that the salivary fern test had a correlation of 36.8% with ultrasound-confirmed ovulation and had a high percentage (58.7%) of uninterpretable patterns.​[^[21]] While another study found a significant agreement (89.4%) between the results of the tests carried out by patients and by laboratory staff.​[^[22]]

#### Proper Use

The choice of a fertility testing method or methods depends upon personal preference, motivation of the person, physical factors (e.g., regularity of the menstrual cycle), and/or the complexity of the testing method. While some studies of accuracy have shown urinary LH tests to be superior to other fertility testing methods,​[^[13]] factors such as human error, variability in menstrual cycles and concurrent medical conditions can have a significant impact on the accuracy of any method.

Home diagnostic kits give an approximate time of ovulation and an indication of when a person may be more fertile. Each kit has a chart or graph that can be used to determine, based on the menstrual cycle, when testing should begin. These instructions should be followed for best results.

People using home ovulation predictor kits and/or basal body temperature charts to detect ovulation should be instructed in the interpretation of the results. Vaginal intercourse should begin before the expected day of ovulation and should occur at approximately 2-day intervals. This timing takes advantage of the fact that sperm survive for up to 5 days in the reproductive tract, especially in good cervical mucus. Because sperm reserves require at least 2 days for replenishment, more frequent vaginal intercourse may result in small volumes and a slightly lower sperm count. The use of artificial lubricants (e.g., K-Y jelly) may interfere with fertility because they decrease sperm motility. 

#### Methods Used to Detect Male Infertility

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Home Testing Products: Fertility Test Kits.

Male infertility is defined as any condition in which the sperm adversely affects the chances of achieving successful pregnancy; it is responsible for approximately 30–40% of infertility cases. While there are many physiological causes of male infertility, it is generally related to sperm production and quality or ejaculation. Diagnostic evaluation begins with history, physical examination and semen analysis. (*Note: This section refers to the term male infertility commonly used in medical literature. CPhA recognizes that the term male may not accurately reflect the identity of the patient and is not inclusive of all individuals. Each patient should be assessed on an individual basis*.)

Semen analysis examines characteristics such as sperm count, morphology and motility. Sperm count refers to the amount of sperm in the ejaculate with the normal range defined as 20–150 million sperm/mL of semen.​[^[23]] Home sperm count tests use the bottom of this range, 20 million sperm/mL, as the threshold for their results. A positive result indicates the sperm count is above 20 million sperm/mL, and a negative result indicates that the count is below 20 million sperm/mL.​[^[24]]​[^[25]] 

Home sperm tests are immunodiagnostic devices, employing monoclonal antibodies that recognize the spermatid and sperm-specific acrosomal protein SP-10. SP-10 is readily released from the sperm’s acrosomal compartment with mild detergents and remains soluble in aqueous solutions, making it available for detection by monoclonal antibodies.​[^[24]] 

To perform the test, people are advised to wait at least 48 hours, but not more than 7 days, after their last ejaculation to collect their semen sample. For testing, semen is ejaculated directly into a collection cup and allowed to stand for 20–60 minutes to allow it to liquefy (it is too thick to be tested immediately after ejaculation). A pipette is then used to stir the semen and draw a sample, which is added to a detergent-containing buffer solution. The mixture is gently agitated and allowed to stand for 2 minutes before being applied directly to the sperm test assay device. Test results are read 7 minutes after the semen mixture is applied to the assay. The test contains a control line and a test line. A test is positive if any line at all appears at the test position, regardless of how dark or faint it may be. If no line appears in the control position, the test did not run correctly and the results are not valid.​[^[25]] 

Human error at any stage in the testing process can impact the validity of the results. Some common causes of error include testing a sample collected less than 48 hours after previous ejaculation; not collecting the entire ejaculate, especially the initial drops; not waiting for the sample to liquefy (minimum 20 minutes, up to 3 hours); not adding the correct amount of semen to the buffer solution; adding solid material from the sample to the buffer solution; not adding the correct number of drops of the sperm mixture to the test device; applying the sperm mixture to the incorrect area on the test device; or reading the test incorrectly due to poor lighting or vision.​[^[25]]

As male infertility cannot be diagnosed on the basis of sperm count alone, the role of the home sperm count test is limited to that of a front-line self-diagnostic tool to direct people to a fertility specialist. The test may assist people concerned about their fertility in deciding whether to seek comprehensive clinical evaluation of their fertility status. While a negative result may indicate infertility, it is important to appreciate that a positive result cannot be interpreted as confirmation of fertility.
