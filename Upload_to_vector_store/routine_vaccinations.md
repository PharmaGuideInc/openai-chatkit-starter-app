#### Introduction

Vaccination is regarded as one of the most successful public health interventions, having contributed to the eradication of smallpox globally and toward the elimination of rubella and polio in Canada.​[^[1]] Other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with low-level incidence in Canada attributed to vaccination include tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, mumps and invasive meningococcal disease.​[^[1]] Currently, routine vaccination rates remain below target across many VPDs,​[^[1]] leaving numerous communities at risk of outbreaks. For example, among children <2 years of age, vaccination rates for *H. influenzae* type b, tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis, and varicella are below the 95% target established by the National Immunization Strategy, at 74%, 78% and 83%, respectively.​[^[1]] As such, vaccination has been identified as a priority for public health efforts across Canada.​[^[2]]

Vaccination of infants and children is important, as they are particularly susceptible to VPDs and their complications. While innate immune function is established relatively soon after birth, T cell function is established more slowly.​[^[3]] Furthermore, while memory B cells are generated in infancy, humoral immune responses are blunted.

Young children become susceptible to infection as passively shared antibodies acquired during gestation decline with time; Figure 1 depicts infant neutralizing antibody levels during the pre- and postpartum phases and into childhood. Through both vaccination and natural exposure, immune function is strengthened; however, these responses may wane over time, requiring booster doses to maintain the protection offered through vaccination.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a graph illustrating the levels of different antibodies in a newborn over time, both in utero and postpartum. Here's a detailed description:

**Graph Axes:**
- **Y-Axis:** Represents the "Antibody level (% of birthing parent's level)" ranging from 0 to over 100.
- **X-Axis:** Represents "Time (months)" from -3 to 18, with a division between "in utero" and "postpartum."

**Key Points:**
- **Birth:** Marked at 0 months on the X-axis.
- **IgG Acquired During Gestation:** Noted with an arrow pointing to a peak just before birth.

**Antibody Levels:**
- **IgM:** Starts at 0, increases gradually after birth, reaching a plateau around 6 months.
- **IgG:** Peaks just before birth, then declines sharply postpartum, stabilizing at a lower level.
- **IgA, IgD, IgE:** Begin at 0, increase slowly postpartum, remaining at lower levels compared to IgM and IgG.

**Time Periods:**
- **In Utero:** From -3 to 0 months.
- **Postpartum:** From 0 to 18 months.

This graph demonstrates the changes in antibody levels from the birthing parent to the newborn, highlighting the transfer and development of immunity over time.

This chapter presents indications and dosing schedules based on recommendations made by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) or published in the Canadian Immunization Guide ​[^[5]] or product monographs. However, vaccine schedules are implemented at the provincial/territorial level and may differ from national recommendations; for more information, see the provincial/territorial schedules for vaccination of infants and children (available from the Government of Canada’s website).

This chapter addresses routine childhood vaccinations that are offered in Canada, such as those against diphtheria, H. influenzae type b, measles, mumps, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, poliomyelitis, rubella and tetanus. This chapter does *not* include information on vaccines discussed in other chapters or those for travel purposes. For more information related to these indications, see:



For information related to travel vaccinations, see Information for the Traveller as well as the Government of Canada: Travel Vaccinations website.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Prior to each vaccination, providers should attempt to obtain a current and complete vaccination history. This history can be collated from a variety of sources including an immunization registry (as available), paper records held by the patient or their caregiver, medical records from other health-care providers, pharmacy dispensing records, and smartphone applications (e.g., CANImmunize). For children, the Canadian Immunization Guide states that “parental recall of prior immunization, in the absence of documentation from the vaccine provider, correlates poorly with vaccines received and should not be accepted as evidence of immunization”;​[^[7]] influenza vaccination is a potential exception. In the absence of complete vaccination records, individuals should be considered unimmunized and therefore initiated on a vaccine schedule appropriate for their age and risk factors. Routine serologic testing is not recommended.​[^[7]]

General investigations to determine the appropriateness of vaccination and whether there is a need for a modified schedule or additional doses based on risk factors should include:

#### Tetanus

Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is caused by a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, with spores widely distributed in soil worldwide. Transmission most commonly occurs through direct contact of a wound with soil, animal or human feces, or dust, and not through person-to-person contact.​[^[16]] This neurotoxin causes muscle spasms that begin in the jaw muscles and cause an inability to open the mouth (trismus or lockjaw) before descending to the throat, where it can cause dysphagia, and to the trunk, where it can cause aspiration and airway obstruction. Autonomic instability may also occur.​[^[17]] Case fatality ranges from 10–80%, especially among infants and older adults.​[^[16]]

Tetanus is considered to have low-level incidence in Canada, with an average annual incidence of 0.01 cases per 100 000 population, corresponding to a 95% reduction in cases since the introduction of tetanus vaccination.​[^[1]] However, vaccination against tetanus remains critical, given its endemicity and environmental spread. Since it is not spread through person-to-person transmission, herd immunity cannot be established, and since it is caused by a toxin rather than the bacteria itself, infection itself does not confer immunity.​[^[16]]

In Canada, tetanus toxoid is available only as a component of combination vaccines containing diphtheria, acellular pertussis, poliomyelitis, H. influenzae type b and/or hepatitis B. Completion of a 3-dose primary series results in protective antibody titers among at least 99% of vaccine recipients. While recent evidence suggests that antibody responses to tetanus decline with an estimated half-life of 14 years,​[^[18]] revaccination at 10-year intervals remains recommended until a comprehensive review of the literature has been completed.​[^[16]]

Vaccines available in Canada against tetanus can be found in Table 4.

#### Diphtheria

Diphtheria is caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria following contact with infected respiratory droplets or cutaneous lesions.​[^[19]] Among those who are unvaccinated when infected, 30% become asymptomatic carriers while 70% experience symptoms; among those who are vaccinated when infected, 90% become asymptomatic carriers while 10% experience symptoms.​[^[19]] Symptoms include mild fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise and anorexia.​[^[20]] Approximately 80% of those who develop symptoms progress to membranous diphtheria, which has a 5–50% mortality rate.​[^[19]] Symptoms of membranous diphtheria include the development of an adherent, asymmetrical, greyish-white membrane on the tonsils and oropharynx.​[^[20]] Death from asphyxia can occur (due to airway obstruction) as well as potentially fatal toxic cardiomyopathy or neurological disorders such as hypoesthesia, polyneuropathy and cranial neuropathies.​[^[19]]

The average annual incidence rate of diphtheria in Canada is 0.014 cases per 100 000 population, or approximately 5 cases per year, which represents an over 99% decline in annual incidence versus the prevaccine era.​[^[1]] Diphtheria vaccines stimulate the production of antibodies against the diphtheria toxoid. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic and severe disease increases with the number of doses received (e.g., effectiveness against severe disease ranges from 47% after 1–2 doses to 81% following full vaccination with ≥3 doses). This immunity wanes over time, with the proportion of individuals with fully protective antibody levels declining by 0.6% per year since vaccination.​[^[19]]

In Canada, all vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid are available only as a component of combination vaccines, with the amount of diphtheria toxoid contained varying by product.​[^[20]] Products with higher concentrations of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunization of infants and children <7 years of age and denoted by an upper case “D,” while those with lower concentrations are used as booster doses and denoted by a lower case “d.” Products containing a lower concentration (d) may be used as a booster dose to children 4 to <7 years of age and are the recommended product for older children, adolescents and adults. Diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine is recommended for routine infant immunization starting at 2 months of age.​[^[20]]

Vaccines available in Canada against diphtheria can be found in Table 4.

#### Pertussis

Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis and is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever and mild cough, followed 1–2 weeks later by rapid coughing that ends with a characteristic whoop upon inspiration and may be severe enough to result in vomiting. This whoop is often absent among infants <6 months of age and in teenagers and adults. Cough and posttussive vomiting may also be absent in young infants who are instead at risk of apnea. Complications of pertussis in infants include death, respiratory failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, subdural or conjunctival bleeding, and encephalopathy, while adolescents may experience rib fractures, subconjunctival hemorrhage, rectal prolapse, or urinary incontinence secondary to coughing.​[^[21]]

Routine vaccination in Canada has been associated with a 95% decline in incidence of pertussis to an annual average of 8 cases per 100 000 population. Vaccination remains important, as pertussis is endemic with peaks in incident cases occurring every 2–5 years.​[^[1]] Each year, 1–3 deaths related to pertussis occur in Canada, primarily in unimmunized or underimmunized infants under 6 months of age.​[^[21]]

In Canada, all vaccines against pertussis are available only as a component of combination vaccines, with the amount of acellular pertussis antigen present varying by product. Products with higher concentrations are designated as “aP” and are primarily used in those <7 years of age, while those with lower concentrations designated as “ap” are used as booster doses in children 4 to <7 years of age, in adolescents and in adults. Completion of the primary series is associated with vaccine efficacy of 85%, which increases to 90% following booster immunization.​[^[21]] A single dose of pertussis vaccine is also recommended during each pregnancy, as it has been shown to provide protection for the newborn; it should ideally be administered between 27–32 weeks’ gestation (although it may be provided anytime between 13 weeks’ gestation and delivery).​[^[22]]

Vaccines available in Canada against pertussis can be found in Table 4.

#### Pneumococcal Disease

Streptococcus pneumoniae is spread through direct oral contact or contact with respiratory droplets, or secretions from a person who is either infected or colonized with the bacterium.​[^[23]] Up to 20–60% of healthy children are asymptomatic carriers.​[^[24]] Infection can lead to bronchitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, otitis media or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), which can include bacteremia or meningitis. Pneumococci cause 50% of all cases of bacterial meningitis in Canada, with an 8% case fatality rate among children. Survivors of pneumococcal meningitis may experience permanent neurologic sequelae.​[^[23]] Of over 100 serotypes of S. pneumoniae identified worldwide,​[^[25]] 15 serotypes are responsible for most cases, although implicated serotypes have been found to differ by age and by serotype coverage with available vaccines.​[^[24]]

Vaccine effectiveness data is not yet available for the 15-valent (Pneu-C-15) or 20-valent (Pneu-C-20) pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, as their approval was based on comparative immunogenicity data against Pneu-C-13.​[^[25]] In children <5 years of age, Pneu-C-13 has 67–96% effectiveness against IPD when caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine, and 20–77% effectiveness against pneumonia.​[^[23]]

Pneu-C-15 or Pneu-C-20 are recommended for children without additional risk factors for IPD, while Pneu-C-20 should be used for those with medical or environmental risk factors (as specified in the Canadian Immunization Guide). This applies to routine use beginning in infancy, catch-up schedules and completion of vaccine series initiated with other pneumococcal vaccines.​[^[23]]

Vaccines available in Canada against pneumococcus can be found in Table 4.

#### Poliomyelitis

Poliovirus is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route with shedding in the feces persisting for 3–6 weeks after infection; respiratory spread may also occur. Approximately 75% of those infected are asymptomatic. Mild illness may present with fever, fatigue, headache or vomiting, with more severe disease presenting with muscle pain and stiffness of the neck and back. Paralysis occurs in less than 1% of cases; however, it is associated with 2–5% mortality among affected children and 15–30% of affected adults.​[^[26]]

As a result of vaccination, endemic poliomyelitis (also known as polio) has been eliminated in Canada with no cases reported from 2015–2019.​[^[1]] Until eradication has been achieved globally, vaccination remains important to protect against imported polio.

Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines are available either as combination vaccines or as a single, polio-only vaccine; they provide protection against all 3 types of poliovirus. Combination vaccines are administered via the intramuscular route while the polio-only vaccine is given subcutaneously. Immunity is achieved in over 95% of vaccine recipients following 3 doses and in close to 100% following a booster dose.​[^[26]] While the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine remains widely used internationally due to its lower cost and easier administration, its use in Canada was discontinued in 1994 due to its association with paralytic polio among recipients.​[^[27]]

Vaccines available in Canada against poliomyelitis can be found in Table 4.

#### Haemophilus influenzae Type B

H. influenzae type b (Hib) is a gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact with nasal or throat discharge.​[^[28]] The bacteria may colonize the nasopharynx, with invasive disease possible when experiencing a concurrent upper respiratory tract infection.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] About 55–65% of children affected by invasive disease develop meningitis (5% mortality rate) and 10–15% experience other severe neurologic sequelae.​[^[28]] Epiglottitis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis and otitis media are also disease manifestations. Hib is the most common cause of epiglottitis in children, which is a serious and potentially fatal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and occasionally emergency intubation in response to airway obstruction.​[^[31]]

Invasive disease due to Hib has declined by 99% among children <5 years of age in Canada following the introduction of vaccination; the current annual average incidence rate is 0.3 cases per 100 000 population, or approximately 16 cases per year.​[^[1]]

Hib-containing vaccines consist of the type b capsular polysaccharide conjugated with tetanus toxoid; however, the amount of tetanus toxoid present should not be considered to offer protection against tetanus disease. Completion of the vaccine series is estimated to result in clinical efficacy of 95–100% among most children, although efficacy among immunodeficient individuals is unknown. Vaccination is recommended beginning at 2 months of age and is not routinely indicated in children ≥5 years of age, since case counts after this age are very low (due to the acquisition of natural immunity). Exceptions to this are vaccination of those age ≥5 years who are at increased risk of invasive disease (e.g., asplenia/hyposplenism, cochlear implant, immunodeficiency).​[^[28]]

Vaccines available in Canada against Hib can be found in Table 4.

#### Hepatitis B

#### Measles, Mumps and Rubella

##### Transmission, Clinical Presentation and Complications



##### Burden of Disease and Impact of Vaccination



##### Vaccine Availability, Efficacy and Tolerability

In Canada, all vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella are combination products with or without varicella and are live vaccines administered by the subcutaneous route. Efficacy against measles following a single dose is 85–95% and approaches 100% with a second dose, while effectiveness against mumps is 62–91% following a single dose and 76–95% following 2 doses. Serologic evidence of immunity against rubella has been identified among at least 95% of vaccine recipients after a single dose, with cellular and humoral immunity persisting for at least 20 years after vaccination.​[^[32]] Routine immunization is currently recommended to begin at 12 months of age, as passive immunization from the birthing parent is believed to provide protection for the first year; however, evidence of waning immunity over this period exists.​[^[36]] Vaccination can be provided as young as 6 months of age for children travelling to areas at risk of exposure; however, any doses given before 12 months of age are not counted toward the routine immunization schedule.​[^[32]]

Adverse events following immunization occur at greater frequency and severity with the first dose than with subsequent doses. The rubella component of the combination vaccines is also associated with acute transient arthritis or arthralgia that is most common in postpubertal females. Measles-like, rubella-like or varicella-like rash may also develop following vaccination in up to 10% of recipients. Although the vaccines are produced in chick embryo cell culture, they are considered safe for those with anaphylactic reaction to eggs, as the trace amounts of egg or chicken protein in the vaccine is insufficient to trigger an allergic reaction.​[^[32]]

Vaccines available in Canada against measles, mumps and rubella can be found in Table 4.

#### Varicella

For information related to varicella, see Herpesvirus Infections.

#### Vaccine Hesitancy

A comprehensive discussion regarding vaccine hesitancy is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, Immunize Canada has collated resources for health-care providers.

A patient-friendly infographic is available in the “Information for the Patient” section.

#### Deviations from Schedule

In general, interruption of an immunization series for a routine vaccine does not require restarting the vaccine series, regardless of the interval between doses.​[^[37]] The only exceptions are for the oral cholera and travellers’ diarrhea vaccines and the rabies vaccine when used for postexposure prophylaxis.​[^[38]] Individuals with interrupted immunization schedules should be vaccinated to complete the appropriate schedule for their current age.​[^[37]]

Minimum ages and intervals between doses exist to ensure an adequate immune response is achieved.​[^[38]] In general, doses given before the recommended age should be repeated on or after the date when the person reaches this minimum age, and doses given off-schedule should be administered late rather than early. For minimum age and minimum time intervals between doses in healthy children, see Table 2.​[^[38]]

| Vaccine | Minimum Age | Minimum Interval Between Doses 1 and 2 | Minimum Interval Between Doses 2 and 3 | Minimum Interval Between Doses 3 and 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib (Infanrix hexa) or DTaP-IPV-Hib (Infanrix-IPV/Hib, Pediacel) | 6 wk | 4 wk | 4 wk | 6 months |
| MMR (M-M-R II, Priorix) | 6 months​[b] | 4 wk | N/A | N/A |
| MMRV (Priorix-Tetra) | 9 months​[b] |  |  |  |
| MMRV (ProQuad) | 12 months |  |  |  |


acellular pertussis; higher dose; for children <7 years

acellular pertussis; lower dose; for children ≥7 years

diphtheria; higher dose; for children <7 years

diphtheria; lower dose; for children ≥7 years

hepatitis B

H. influenzae type b

inactivated poliovirus

measles, mumps and rubella

tetanus

varicella

#### Vaccine Product Interchangeability

Ideally, the same manufacturer’s product should be used for all doses in a vaccine series, since differences between manufacturers’ production methods, antigen contents, adjuvants, conjugating proteins or other additives may theoretically impact interchangeability. However, vaccination should not be deferred due to unavailability of a specific product.​[^[39]]

For each indication discussed in this chapter, vaccine product interchangeability is acceptable based on expert opinion discussed in the vaccine-specific chapters of the Canadian Immunization Guide.​[^[5]]

#### Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

While this chapter is focused on vaccinations for children, vaccination in pregnancy also offers benefits to newborns through the passive transfer of antibodies via the placenta and/or breast milk, especially within the first 6 months of life (when many vaccines are not indicated). Vaccine-specific guidelines include:​[^[5]]

1. **Title and Header:**
   - The main title is "Childhood Vaccinations."
   - A subtitle reads "Frequently Asked Questions by Canadian Parents and Caregivers."

2. **Sections and Content:**

   - **Section 1:**
     - **Question:** "Why are children vaccinated from such a young age? Can their bodies even handle so many vaccinations?"
     - **Answer:** This section explains that babies receive antibodies from their mothers, but these decrease over time. Vaccinations help protect children from diseases as their immune systems develop. Vaccines are tested for safety and effectiveness in children.

   - **Section 2:**
     - **Question:** "If a child doesn’t have any medical conditions, can’t their immune system fight off these diseases naturally?"
     - **Answer:** It explains that while some children might recover from diseases naturally, vaccines prevent the diseases from occurring in the first place. Vaccines are safer than risking the disease itself.

   - **Section 3:**
     - **Question:** "I don’t know of anyone who has been sick from things like whooping cough or measles. If these diseases are rare, is vaccination necessary?"
     - **Answer:** This section highlights that vaccines have made these diseases rare. However, if vaccination rates drop, these diseases can return. Vaccination is necessary to maintain herd immunity.
