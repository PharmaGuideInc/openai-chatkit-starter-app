#### Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disturbance characterized by fasting and/or postprandial hyperglycemia. Rather than a single disease entity, diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous syndrome that is caused by an absolute or relative lack of insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both. Dysglycemia is a term that describes abnormal blood glucose levels without a definite threshold. The term reflects current evidence that minor degrees of blood glucose abnormalities, even those that do not meet the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus, are still associated with increased cardiovascular risk.​[^[1]] 

Long-term diabetes mellitus may lead to complications that involve the small blood vessels (microvascular) and large blood vessels (macrovascular) of multiple organs and systems. Because diabetes is associated with significant dysfunction of numerous metabolic pathways, clinicians must pay close attention to factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia in addition to blood glucose. Heart disease is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes.​[^[2]]

#### Classification

*Type 1* diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is due to autoimmune beta cell destruction resulting in an absolute deficiency of insulin. T1DM usually presents with acute metabolic symptoms of relatively short duration in a child, adolescent or young adult. If untreated, ketoacidosis may occur. Although onset of T1DM is not common after 30 years of age, some older individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus may develop markers of autoimmunity and progress quickly to an insulin-dependent state. This late autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is considered a variation of T1DM, and variable titres of islet cell or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoantibodies are detectable. In North America, T1DM accounts for 5–10% of all patients with diabetes. Recent incident studies have revealed that the rates of T1DM are increasing,​[^[3]] including in adults older than 30 years of age.​[^[4]] 

*Type 2* diabetes mellitus (T2DM) manifests primarily as insulin resistance along with some degree of insulin deficiency. Over time, insulin deficiency worsens, resulting in more prominent hyperglycemia. T2DM is commonly discovered incidentally, or is diagnosed in adults with obesity who have nonspecific symptoms. T2DM makes up 90% of all cases of diabetes mellitus and the prevalence is rising rapidly, particularly in certain ethnic groups, both in Canada and worldwide. It is also being diagnosed more frequently and earlier in adolescents and in children with obesity.

*Gestational* diabetes is defined as first onset or recognition of glucose intolerance during pregnancy. 

Other specific causes of diabetes mellitus include the monogenetic syndromes such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), or are a result of pancreatic diseases (Type 3c), infectious agents, drugs, pancreatic surgery or other diseases leading to carbohydrate intolerance. Drugs that can perturb blood glucose levels and interfere with glycemic control in patients with diabetes are presented in Table 1.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



In the absence of clinical symptoms of hyperglycemia, confirm the diagnosis with a repeat test performed on another day;​[^[5]] with the exception of a random plasma glucose, the same test should be used to confirm the initial result.

#### Screening

Screening for T1DM is not recommended in individuals with normal glucose levels. While the autoantibodies thought to contribute to the destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells can be detected prior to disease, their presence does not guarantee that diabetes will occur. Although research continues, there are no interventions proven to prevent or delay the onset of T1DM.

Diabetes Canada recommends screening for T2DM every 3 years in individuals over 40 years of age or those determined to be high risk using a validated tool such as CANRISK by testing either FPG or HbA1c.​[^[7]]​[^[8]] Earlier and more frequent testing should be considered in individuals at a higher risk (see Table 2).​[^[9]]

#### Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

#### Therapeutic Choices

Depending on the presentation and clinical circumstances, diabetes mellitus may be initially treated with nonpharmacologic choices (such as diet and exercise) or pharmacologic choices. Whereas a presentation indicative of T1DM necessitates initiation of insulin, a presentation indicative of T2DM may require initiation of insulin, other antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy or lifestyle modifications alone.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

As a chronic condition, diabetes mellitus is largely self-managed. Pivotal to self-management is integrating nonpharmacologic interventions in the management of both T1DM and T2DM. The use of a flow chart may be helpful to ensure important interventions are not overlooked (see Appendix 3 at https://guidelines.diabetes.ca for an example).



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Type 1 Diabetes

Insulin may be administered by syringe, pen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump). Although insulins from animal sources are still marketed in Canada, most patients use human insulin and insulin analogues since these agents cause less antibody generation and related adverse reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, insulin resistance). Human insulins are produced by recombinant DNA technology and have an amino acid sequence identical to endogenous human insulin. Insulin analogues are slightly modified human insulin molecules (see Table 3 and Table 8). The rapid-acting insulin analogues (RAIAs) insulin aspart, insulin glulisine and insulin lispro allow for more flexibility to control postprandial glucose because of their faster onset of action compared with short-acting insulins. There is a concentrated 200 units/mL version of insulin lispro available, which allows a reduced volume to be injected in those requiring large doses with each meal (>20 units). Additionally, a faster-acting insulin aspart is available, which appears in the bloodstream approximately twice as fast as the original insulin aspart formulation, has superior postprandial blood glucose control and is noninferior with respect to HbA1c.​[^[22]] 

| Insulin Class | Insulin Type (Brand) | Onset | Peak | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogues | insulin aspart (NovoRapid, Trurapi) | 10–15 min | 60–90 min | 4–5 h |
| insulin aspart (Fiasp) | 5 min | 30–90 min | 3–5 h |  |
| insulin glulisine (Apidra) | 10–15 min | 60–90 min | 4–5 h |  |
| insulin lispro (Humalog, Admelog) | 10–15 min | 60–90 min | 4–5 h |  |
| Short-Acting Insulin | insulin, regular (Humulin R, Novolin ge Toronto) | 30–60 min | 2–4 h | 5–8 h |
| insulin, regular (Entuzity U500) | 15–60 min | 4–8 h | 17–24 h |  |
| pork insulin (Hypurin Regular) | 30 min | 2–4 h | 5–7 h |  |
| Intermediate-Acting Insulin | insulin, NPH (Humulin N, Novolin ge NPH) | 1–2 h | 5–8 h | 14–18 h |
| pork insulin, NPH (Hypurin NPH) | 1–3 h | 6–12 h | 24–28 h |  |
| Long-Acting Insulin Analogues | insulin degludec (Tresiba) | 30–90 min | Flat, no discernible peak | 42 h |
| insulin detemir (Levemir) | 1–4 h | Flat, no discernible peak | 6–24 h |  |
| insulin glargine (Lantus, Basaglar, Toujeo U100) | 2–4 h | Flat, no discernible peak | 24 h |  |
| insulin glargine (Toujeo U300) | 1–6 h | Flat, no discernible peak | 24–36 h |  |


The long-acting insulin analogues (LAIAs) insulin degludec, insulin detemir and insulin glargine appear to produce more predictable effects than intermediate-acting human insulin (NPH) and are associated with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia.​[^[23]] In a meta-analysis, patients with T1DM who used LAIAs for a year had significantly fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to using NPH (NNT = 20 to prevent 1 episode).​[^[24]] Insulin glargine is available in different formulations, including a concentrated 300 units/mL product. This concentrated formulation appears to have a longer duration of action, has no peak effect and further reduces hypoglycemia compared to glargine 100 units/mL.​[^[25]] Insulin degludec is available in 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL strengths and has a duration of action of approximately 42 hours.​[^[26]] Compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL, it was shown to be as effective in controlling glucose, with a 26% relative risk reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia.​[^[27]] A phase 2 clinical trial in patients with T1DM was recently completed, which showed that a once-weekly LAIA in development had similar safety and efficacy to a once-daily insulin glargine 100 units/mL. ​[^[28]] A phase 3 clinical trial is currently underway in those with T2DM.​[^[29]] 

#### Insulin Regimens

Although an in-depth discussion about the different types of insulin regimens is beyond the scope of this chapter, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that intensive treatment regimens control blood glucose more effectively than conventional regimens and reduce the risk of long-term diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy).​[^[30]] Follow-up data from the trial demonstrate a long-term benefit of intensive therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.​[^[31]] Newly diagnosed patients and those with poor glycemic control on conventional regimens should be offered the option of intensive diabetes management consisting of multiple-dose insulin (MDI) regimens (see Table 4). It is essential to assess each patient to determine whether an intensive regimen is a suitable option. Less intensive regimens may be a better choice in the frail elderly, unmotivated patients or those who lack awareness of severe hypoglycemia. In clinical practice, RAIA in combination with LAIA is preferred over regular insulin in order to minimize risk of hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c and postprandial glucose levels.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

Most lean patients with T1DM require approximately 0.5 units of insulin per kilogram of body mass. In the first few months following a T1DM diagnosis, patients may experience periods where the requirement for insulin is decreased or transiently eliminated. This phenomenon is known as the honeymoon phase. Insulin therapy should be initiated judiciously in order to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and adjusted every 2–3 days according to blood glucose results. Regular home monitoring allows patients to adjust the dose of insulin in response to abnormal blood glucose levels, effects of diet and exercise, and changing blood glucose patterns. Optimal blood glucose control is achieved by matching the timing of insulin injections with caloric intake: regular insulin is given approximately 30 minutes before meals and RAIAs should ideally be administered 0–15 minutes prior to starting a meal, although they can be administered up to 15 minutes (and 20 minutes for faster aspart) after the start of a meal.

The use of insulin pumps and regimens involving multiple doses of RAIA (vs. regular human insulin) improves the stability of postprandial glucose levels and may also diminish the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, especially early nocturnal hypoglycemia. In addition, insulin pumps can achieve a tighter and more reproducible degree of glycemic control, particularly in those with a high initial HbA1c, but at a significantly increased expense for the patient.

#### Adverse Effects of Insulin Therapy



#### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Initial management of patients with T2DM generally depends on the HbA1c and clinical symptoms displayed, as described below:​[^[37]]

In patients with an HbA1c less than 1.5% above their personalized target, nonpharmacologic therapy alone (e.g., diet and exercise) can be initiated; however, medications must be initiated without delay if glycemic targets are not met within 3 months. In patients with an HbA1c more than 1.5% above their personalized target, medication should be initiated immediately (along with diet and exercise). Metformin is the drug of choice for initiation either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic medication if it is unreasonable to expect desired control with metformin monotherapy. In those patients who are exhibiting extremely high glucose levels at presentation, are very symptomatic or are exhibiting signs of metabolic decompensation, initiation with insulin with or without metformin should occur. 

For those patients newly diagnosed with diabetes, the goal is to reach the desired HbA1c target within 3–6 months through dosage titration or the addition of other agents (see Figure 2, Table 9). Typically, the higher the baseline HbA1c, the greater the reduction in HbA1c that can be achieved with treatment.​[^[38]] After metformin, the drug chosen as the second-line agent should be individualized, taking into consideration presence of clinical cardiovascular disease, kidney function, heart failure, hypoglycemia, weight concerns, cost and insurance coverage, amongst others. 

Vascular protection is a significant goal in the management of diabetes (see Targets for Control). In 2008 the FDA began requiring cardiovascular safety trials as part of the approval process for new medications for T2DM. None of the cardiovascular outcome trials initiated since 2008 have demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular events, and some trials have found a reduction in CV events. Diabetes Canada, along with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends that the results of cardiovascular safety trials be considered when selecting medications for the treatment of T2DM.​[^[37]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

#### Biguanides

Metformin is generally considered the first choice for patients with a new and uncomplicated diagnosis of T2DM. It decreases hepatic glucose production and may lower glucose absorption and enhance insulin-mediated glucose uptake. It is not associated with weight gain, it lowers HbA1c by approximately 1–1.5%, and the risk of hypoglycemia is low when it is used as monotherapy. However, it can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of insulin and sulfonylureas. Although the use of metformin has traditionally been discouraged due to the perceived risk of lactic acidosis in patients with heart failure, renal or hepatic disease, or hypoxemic states, a Cochrane review of 347 studies comparing over 70 000 subjects found no increase in the rate of lactic acidosis among patients receiving metformin compared with controls receiving other antihyperglycemic agents.​[^[41]] Metformin may reduce CV risk,​[^[37]] is considered safe to use in stable heart failure and liver disease, and reduced doses can be used with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Metformin should be withheld if a person is acutely ill and is unable to maintain fluid intake, and is also routinely held preoperatively and when imaging-contrast agents are being given due to the possibility of acute renal failure, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

#### Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitors

 Acarbose inhibits intestinal alpha-glucosidases, resulting in delayed digestion of starches and disaccharides and reduced postprandial glucose levels. It does not significantly inhibit intestinal lactase. Acarbose does not cause hypoglycemia but can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and causes significant GI effects. In addition, it requires TID dosing and is effective only if taken with a meal; hence, it should be taken with the first bite of a meal. Its effects on HbA1c are relatively modest; it can be expected to lower HbA1c by ≤1%. Because the digestion of sucrose is impaired by acarbose, hypoglycemia in patients taking acarbose should be treated with glucose rather than sucrose. In the Acarbose Cardiovascular Evaluation (ACE) trial, acarbose did not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among Chinese patients with established heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance.​[^[42]]

#### Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors

Endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) to an inactive state. DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin and sitagliptin) increase the availability of GLP-1 as well as other potentially active peptides involved in glucose homeostasis.​[^[43]] Overall, they lower HbA1c by ≤1% and are well tolerated medications with low risk of hypoglycemia. Although the SAVOR-TIMI trial showed an increase in hospitalization for heart failure with saxagliptin,​[^[44]] this has not been noted with other medications in this class. The cardiovascular outcome trials that have been performed have shown that these drugs do not alter CV risk.​[^[37]]

#### Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists mimic the actions of GLP-1, an endogenous incretin hormone. GLP-1 is secreted in response to food ingestion by endocrine cells found in the GI tract.​[^[45]] Once released into the circulation, GLP-1 increases insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion during the postprandial period, slows gastric emptying and increases satiety,​[^[43]] resulting in better control of glucose levels as well as weight loss. Whereas DPP-4 inhibitors can provide a physiologic increase in GLP-1, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (or GLP1RAs) provide a pharmacologic increase, which results in improved HbA1c lowering along with GI side effects, in particular nausea upon initiation. GLP1RAs are available in subcutaneous (short acting: lixisenatide; and long-acting: dulaglutide, liraglutide, semaglutide) and oral (**semaglutide**) formulations, and can decrease HbA1c by approximately 1–1.5%. The injectable long-acting GLP1RAs are either administered daily (liraglutide) or weekly (dulaglutide, semaglutide) without regard to meals. Lixisenatide is available only as an injection combined with insulin glargine. Oral semaglutide is taken daily on an empty stomach upon waking, with only minimal water and no other food, drink or medications for at least 30 minutes. These GLP1RAs are more effective at lowering HbA1c through their effects on FPG. Semaglutide has been associated with an increased rate of diabetic retinopathy complications compared to placebo in the SUSTAIN-6 trial; however, this is thought to be observed in those with poor glycemic control who experienced rapid improvements in HbA1c, particularly in those with pre-existing retinopathy.​[^[46]] 

Most cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) included participants with a history of cardiovascular disease, and of these, liraglutide and injectable semaglutide showed a reduction in MACE.​[^[47]]​[^[48]] The REWIND trial with dulaglutide consisted primarily of a primary prevention population in those with CV risk factors, and it also showed a reduction in MACE compared to placebo (12.0% vs. 13.4%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.99; p = 0.026).​[^[49]] Hence, there is evidence of preventing cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention patients with some of the GLP1RAs.

#### Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide lowers glucose levels by enhancing insulin secretion and reducing glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. It is a subcutaneous injection administered once weekly. As with GLP1RAs, it is recommended to titrate the dose up slowly in order to minimize the nausea that may occur as an adverse effect. Results from the SURPASS trials showed improved HbA1c  lowering as well as increased weight loss versus placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec and insulin glargine.​[^[50]]​[^[51]]​[^[52]] SURPASS-CVOT is an ongoing trial designed to assess the effect of tirzepatide versus dulaglutide on MACE in patients with T2DM and increased CV risk.​[^[53]]

#### Insulin Secretagogues: Sulfonylureas

There are currently 4 sulfonylureas (SUs) available in Canada: gliclazide, glimepiride, glyburide and tolbutamide. They stimulate both basal and meal-stimulated insulin release and can lower HbA1c by 1–1.5%. Significant differences exist between agents in regard to effectiveness, hypoglycemia risk, postprandial correction of glucose and weight gain. The first-generation SU tolbutamide is typically not used due to improvements in the risk profile seen with the second-generation SUs. Glyburide is a second-generation SU that is associated with a greater risk of hypoglycemia than other second-generation SUs,​[^[54]] especially in elderly patients or those with renal impairment. Glyburide is also associated with more weight gain, although it can occur with any of these agents to varying degrees. SUs are considered as add-on options to metformin, or less often as monotherapy when metformin is contraindicated. They are often considered an option if the cost of therapy is a significant consideration. The CV safety of SUs is uncertain due to a lack of trial data. The CAROLINA trial showed that glimepiride was noninferior to linagliptin for the prevention of MACE.​[^[55]]

#### Insulin Secretagogues: Meglitinides

Repaglinide stimulates insulin release like the SUs, but activity is much shorter. Meglitinides need to be taken just prior to meals to reduce postprandial glucose elevations and should be omitted if the meal is missed. Repaglinide is expected to lower HbA1c to a similar extent as SUs and it is also considered to confer a lower risk of hypoglycemia in the context of missed meals (patients who skip meals could omit the associated repaglinide dose). FPG usually drops after about 1 month of regular use.​[^[56]] It has been theorized that the greater effect on postprandial glucose compared with SUs would translate into a more favourable effect on cardiovascular outcomes; however, this benefit has not been established.​[^[54]]

#### Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin [not available in Canada]) prevent glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased excretion of urinary glucose and a lowering of blood glucose.​[^[57]] They are associated with weight loss, and their glucose-lowering ability is similar to that of other antihyperglycemic agents.​[^[58]] ​[^[59]] However, their antihyperglycemic ability is diminished with lower glomerular filtration rates. The SGLT2 inhibitors cause a small decrease in blood pressure, and they are associated with only a low risk of hypoglycemia. Side effects of note with this class of medications include mycotic genital infections, volume depletion-related adverse effects and some reports of diabetic ketoacidosis. Canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of lower extremity amputations and risk of fracture in the CANVAS trial, but this was not observed in CREDENCE or OBSERVE-4D.​[^[60]]​[^[61]]

In cardiovascular outcome trials, a reduction in MACE was observed with empagliflozin and canagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials.​[^[62]]​[^[63]] EMPA-REG OUTCOME enrolled patients with known CVD, whereas the CANVAS program enrolled patients with and without CVD. DECLARE-TIMI 58 tested the CV safety of dapagliflozin in a majority of patients without CVD, and it met the criteria for noninferiority for MACE, but not superiority.​[^[64]] Similarly, the results of the VERTIS CV trial with ertugliflozin showed noninferiority, but not superiority.​[^[65]] These trials trended toward beneficial effects with respect to their use in heart failure and effects on kidney function, which led to subsequent clinical trials evaluating their use in these populations.

DAPA-HF randomized heart failure patients with or without diabetes to dapagliflozin or placebo, and dapagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of worsening HF, CV death and all-cause mortality.​[^[66]]​[^[67]] Additionally, the EMPEROR-Reduced trial randomized heart failure patients with or without diabetes to either empagliflozin or placebo, and empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure.​[^[68]] Hence, the use of these agents is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or CV death.​[^[67]]

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of nephropathy as a secondary outcome in various trials, and CREDENCE was the first study to demonstrate their effects on progression of kidney disease as a primary outcome.​[^[61]] In patients with T2DM, CKD and significant proteinuria, canagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of kidney failure and CV events than with placebo. Hence, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended in patients with CKD and an eGFR >30mL/min to reduce the risk of progression of nephropathy.​[^[67]]

#### Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)

Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) receptors located on the cell nucleus. These medications influence gene expression in the cell leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity and lower levels of blood glucose and circulating insulin. The precise mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear.​[^[69]] The TZDs also exhibit increased peripheral glucose uptake, enhanced fat cell sensitivity to insulin and decreased hepatic glucose output. The risk of hypoglycemia with TZDs is low when taken as monotherapy; however, they may enhance the hypoglycemic effects of insulin and SUs. The mean decrease in HbA1c is 1–1.5%. Individual TZDs may differ in their effects on serum lipids.​[^[70]] Both agents are associated with weight gain due to increased subcutaneous fat deposition, fluid retention and edema, which is likely the cause of the increased incidence of heart failure in patients receiving TZDs.​[^[69]]​[^[71]] Other reported adverse effects include worsening macular edema​[^[72]] and an increased risk of fractures, particularly of the hip and wrist.​[^[73]]​[^[74]] Although any link has not fully elucidated, pioglitazone has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.​[^[75]]

The cardiovascular safety of thiazolidinediones is in question. Some analyses have reported an increase in the risk of ischemic events such as MI in patients receiving rosiglitazone,​[^[76]]​[^[77]] while other research suggests that rosiglitazone confers a protective effect from ischemic events.​[^[78]] Studies of pioglitazone have more consistently lacked any signal of increased risk of ischemic events.​[^[78]] To ensure that the risks and benefits of this medication have been clearly communicated, Health Canada requires that physicians counsel patients and obtain their written consent for all new and renewed rosiglitazone prescriptions. The FDA has removed its prescribing restrictions for rosiglitazone-containing products (Avandia, Avandamet, Avandaryl, generics) after a re-evaluation of the RECORD trial did not show an increased risk of MI.​[^[79]]

#### Insulin Regimens for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Due to the progressive nature of T2DM, noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents can gradually lose their effectiveness over time. Insulin remains an important option for patients because of its powerful effects on lowering HbA1c and lack of a dose ceiling. Insulin does not alter CV risk.​[^[37]] Although it is appropriate to consider insulin initiation at any point in the management of T2DM, it is commonly reserved for the following situations:



The use of insulin is often delayed for multiple reasons, one of which is the perceived complexity of self-injections. Also, insulin is associated with weight gain and carries a higher risk of hypoglycemia than other agents used to treat T2DM. Self-monitoring is critical to its safe and effective use. Many patients with T2DM require high doses of insulin (≥1 unit/kg) to overcome their significant insulin resistance, which increases the risk for adverse effects. There are several commonly used insulin regimens (see Table 4):



#### Targets for Control

The 2018 Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines emphasize that glycemic targets should be individualized based on patient-specific factors (see Table 5). The target of HbA1c ≤7% for most patients with T1DM and T2DM is based on strong evidence supporting the relationship between tight glucose control and a reduction in microvascular and neuropathic complications.​[^[82]] In contrast, it remains unclear if macrovascular (ischemic) events are influenced by tight glucose control.​[^[85]]​[^[86]]​[^[87]] A more aggressive HbA1c of ≤6.5% may be targeted in patients with T2DM if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risk of hypoglycemia. Conversely, a higher HbA1c of up to 8.5% may be more appropriate if the risk of hypoglycemia outweighs the benefits of tight control, e.g., in frail elderly patients, those with limited life expectancy or patients with a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia.​[^[82]]

*Vascular protection* is a critical component of the management strategy for patients with diabetes. It is important to target all associated risk factors in addition to achieving glycemic control.​[^[88]] It has been shown that a coordinated, multifactorial intervention involving behaviour modification and pharmacologic therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body weight, microalbuminuria and platelet activation can significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes.​[^[89]] See Diabetes Mellitus - Chronic Complications for further discussion of managing CV risk.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Carbohydrate intolerance during pregnancy can occur in patients with diabetes prior to pregnancy and in those who develop diabetes during pregnancy.

#### Diabetes and Pregnancy

Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus can occur in patients of childbearing age, while *gestational diabetes mellitus* (GDM) is a condition that develops during pregnancy, primarily due to insulin resistance that results from the high levels of gestational hormones.​[^[90]] Regardless of the specific diagnosis type, the existence of diabetes in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of negative outcomes in both the pregnant patient and the fetus/infant.​[^[91]] Pre-existing diabetes (type 1 or 2) increases the risk of miscarriage, perinatal mortality, fetal macrosomia and congenital malformations, the latter being due to hyperglycemia in the first weeks of gestation.​[^[92]] Similarly, GDM increases the risk of fetal hyperinsulinemia, heavier birth weight, higher rates of cesarean deliveries and neonatal hypoglycemia.​[^[90]] Children born to patients with diabetes and those with a history of GDM also appear to have an increased risk of developing diabetes in the future.​[^[93]]

When diabetes is pre-existing, prepregnancy counselling is essential, and good glucose control should be achieved even before conception.​[^[90]] Although the benefits of treating patients with pre-existing diabetes have been clearly demonstrated,​[^[90]] the benefits of treating GDM are less clear.​[^[94]]​[^[95]] Diabetes treatments confer a risk of hypoglycemia and some may exhibit teratogenic effects; thus, careful monitoring and therapeutic selection is required. Fortunately, hypoglycemia may not pose substantial risks to the developing fetus,​[^[92]] but instances of diabetic ketoacidosis are very dangerous and can occur in cases such as unrecognized failure of an insulin pump.

#### Prepregnancy Planning



#### Management during Pregnancy

All pregnant patients should be screened for GDM; see Figure 3 for the approach preferred by Diabetes Canada. Referral to a specialized clinic for the management of diabetes in pregnancy, if available, is recommended. Initiate nonpharmacologic therapy (strict diet and exercise) in patients who are newly diagnosed with GDM.​[^[90]] Continue nonpharmacologic therapy and start multiple daily injections of RAIA or regular insulin if fasting and postprandial targets have not been met within 2 weeks of adjusting these lifestyle measures.​[^[105]]​[^[106]] The LAIAs glargine (100 units/mL) and detemir have demonstrated safety with similar maternal and fetal outcomes compared to (NPH) insulin.​[^[90]] In patients with GDM who cannot take insulin, it may be reasonable to consider glyburide or metformin, recognizing that use of either agent is off-label.​[^[95]]​[^[107]] In a study designed to look at the impact of metformin use in pregnant patients with pre-existing T2DM who already use insulin, patients had better glycemic control, less weight gain, fewer C-sections and smaller babies with metformin added.​[^[108]] There were, however, more ‘small for gestation age’ babies. Future follow-up of this cohort will be needed to determine the long-term outcomes. 

In patients with diabetes who successfully become pregnant, strict glycemic control is recommended, along with frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Both pre- and postprandial testing is suggested in order to facilitate the achievement of both targets outlined in Table 6. Aim to achieve an HbA1c level during pregnancy of ≤6.5% (≤6.1% if safely achievable). In addition, ketone testing (urine or blood) may be considered to ensure that the diet is adequate to prevent starvation ketosis. To reduce the risk of preeclampsia, patients with pre-existing diabetes should start **ASA** 81 mg daily at 12–16 weeks’ gestation. Consider the use of an insulin pump or CGM to improve glycemic control in those with T1DM.

fasting plasma glucose

#### Diabetes and Breastfeeding

Patients with diabetes are encouraged to breastfeed to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.​[^[90]] Although insulin is transferred into breast milk, it poses little risk to the infant because the hormone is degraded in the GI tract before reaching the systemic circulation.​[^[107]] As a result, breastfeeding patients receiving insulin do not need to alter their regimen unless it is in response to their personal glycemic levels. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is extremely important after delivery because insulin requirements may change quickly and the increased caloric output during breastfeeding theoretically puts the patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia.

#### Management during Breastfeeding

After delivery, most patients will remain in hospital for at least 24 hours. During this time, glycemic monitoring should be performed frequently to assess for changes in blood glucose levels. In many cases of GDM, hyperglycemia will resolve completely during this time and antihyperglycemic medications may be discontinued altogether. In addition, all postpartum patients with GDM should have their glycemic status assessed by their primary care provider sometime in the months following delivery. All patients diagnosed with GDM should have a 75 g OGTT between 6 weeks and 6 months following delivery to detect persistent hyperglycemia.

In patients who require ongoing antihyperglycemic medication, insulin remains the first choice for reasons previously noted. However, both glyburide and metformin have also been used in breastfeeding patients with T2DM. Limited data suggest glyburide does not pass into breast milk, and metformin appears to have little penetration.​[^[107]] Although these agents can be considered for use in breastfeeding patients, long-term studies have not been done to rule out any unanticipated adverse effects. 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Preventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

#### Risk Factors and Strategies

The prevalence of T2DM has been rising for decades and is expected to afflict 5 million Canadians by the year 2025.​[^[109]] As a result, many studies have focused on preventative strategies aimed at individuals who exhibit risk factors for the development of this disease. Although family history, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and poor diet are risk factors for T2DM, individuals with slightly elevated blood glucose levels are likely at the greatest short-term risk of reaching the diagnostic threshold. Individuals who exhibit elevated blood glucose concentrations (yet below the threshold for diabetes) can be described as having *impaired fasting glucose* (FPG 6.1–6.9 mmol/L), *impaired glucose tolerance* (plasma glucose of 7.8–11 mmol/L 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose load) or both. Generally, individuals exhibiting slight elevations in blood glucose concentrations have been insulin-resistant for years, but glucose levels were likely maintained by increased insulin secretion. Frequently, insulin resistance is accompanied by other metabolic disruptions that are probably linked by 1 or more common biologic pathways. Clustering of metabolic risk factors such as central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and glucose abnormalities is termed *metabolic syndrome*. It confers a significant short-term risk of overt diabetes and a long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.​[^[110]]

Several large studies have examined nonpharmacologic (diet, exercise, weight loss) and pharmacologic strategies aimed at preventing the onset of T2DM in high-risk individuals.

The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS)​[^[111]] and the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)​[^[112]] showed that *calorie restriction* along with a supervised *exercise program* of moderate intensity (about 150 min/wk) significantly reduced the relative risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 58% at 4 years. In the DPS, diabetes was diagnosed in 11% of those randomized to lifestyle intervention versus 23% in the control group. In the DPP study, diabetes developed in 4.8%, 7.8% and 11% of those randomized to lifestyle intervention, metformin and placebo respectively. The weight loss associated with lifestyle interventions was about 5–6% of initial body weight in these studies. Interestingly, the benefits of the lifestyle changes persisted long after these trials were completed.​[^[113]]​[^[114]] These findings prove the success of lifestyle interventions and the significance for all people at high-risk of developing diabetes.

Other studies have evaluated the impact of pharmacologic interventions on the incidence of T2DM. It has been shown that metformin,​[^[112]]​[^[114]] acarbose,​[^[115]] **TZDs**​[^[116]]​[^[117]]​[^[118]]​[^[119]] and orlistat​[^[120]] can also reduce the incidence of T2DM in at-risk patients. In 1 study, rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of progression to diabetes from 26% to 11.6% over 3 years compared with placebo, a similar benefit to that reported in the lifestyle intervention trials above. The benefit was offset to some extent by a significantly higher incidence of heart failure relative to placebo (0.5% vs. 0.1%).​[^[116]] 

The ability of diet alone to prevent T2DM is supported by a large study demonstrating the ability of 46% of participants to achieve remission with weight loss after 3–5 months of a structured, very low-calorie diet.​[^[121]] Including 1 or more whole-grain food serving per day was associated with a 29% decreased risk of developing T2DM over those with minimal intake.​[^[122]] The health benefits of fruit and vegetables in preventing T2DM have also been reported.​[^[123]] Other clinical trials evaluating different pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent diabetes are ongoing; hence, knowledge about these strategies is continuously growing.

There are currently no known safe and effective measures to prevent T1DM, although research continues to occur in this area. 

#### Diabetic Ketoacidosis

#### Assessment and Management

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially fatal complication of severe insulin deficiency seen in T1DM that presents as metabolic decompensation of varying severity. It is characterized by variable hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acidosis, depressed levels of consciousness and detectable ketones in the urine or blood.​[^[124]] Upon presentation, patients are depleted in sodium, potassium, chloride and water. Despite body-wide potassium depletion, serum potassium is frequently elevated at the time of presentation due to lack of insulin and an inability of potassium to efficiently enter cells. Pre-renal failure, or anuria, may be present secondary to severe dehydration. Hyperglycemia, as well as high triglycerides and free fatty acids, may result in pseudohyponatremia, or falsely low sodium measurements. 

Diabetic ketoacidosis is found most often in T1DM and may be seen at first presentation in newly diagnosed patients, or when patients are nonadherent to insulin therapy. It is also often associated with the onset of a severe or stressful illness (e.g., severe infection), surgery, trauma, MI or the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients who were previously stable. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis are generally hospitalized. A detailed treatment algorithm is published in the 2018 Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines and is available online​[^[124]] (https://guidelines.diabetes.ca) and outlined in Table 7.

|  |
| --- |
| Fluids: Patients are always significantly volume depleted. Give IV NS 500 mL for 4 h, then 250 mL for 4 h (faster if in shock), then individualize. Good urinary output is reassuring that volume is being replaced. |
| Potassium: Potassium chloride is the preparation of choice. Do not give unless urine is being produced; may need to wait for IV fluids to improve volume status. If serum K​+ is <3.3 mmol/L, add K​+ 40 mmol/L of fluid; if 3.3–5.5 mmol/L, add K​+ 20 mmol/L; if >5.5 mmol/L, do not add K​+, but monitor hourly. Rehydration and insulin will drive K​+ levels down. |
| Insulin: Do not give insulin if K​+ is <3.3 mmol/L, as insulin will drive K​+ into cells and drop levels further. Once K​+ >3.3 mmol/L, insulin can be infused at 0.1 units/kg/h using a second IV line. One protocol is as follows: mix 25 units R insulin in 250 mL NS and adjust rate to drop glucose to <14 mmol/L. Continue IV insulin until the anion gap resolves and patient eating without nausea. Never stop or hold insulin in DKA. Rather, if the glucose drops below 14 mmol/L, continue the insulin infusion but also switch the saline IV to D5½NS and adjust the IV rate to maintain glucose between 12 and 14 mmol/L. When anion gap closed and patient eating, overlap IV insulin with SC insulin by 2 h before stopping IV. DKA can rapidly reoccur if waiting for SC insulin to peak. |
| Bicarbonate: Not first-line therapy; infrequently used. Consider giving 1 ampoule (50 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate in 200 mL D5W over 1 h if acidosis is severe and ICU is being considered (e.g., pH <7, lowered LOC). |
| Laboratory tests: Latest recommendations include bedside testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone that is not detected with standard ketone testing.​[125]​[126] Initial CBC, glucose, electrolytes, urea, creatinine and ABG. Request blood or urine cultures to look for infection as indicated. Radiology looking for infection/trigger as indicated. Repeat electrolyte and glucose hourly; ABG only if severe acidosis persists. Capillary glucose (with bedside glucometer) hourly for trends, but requires repeated blood draws for confirmation. |
| Supportive care: Keep the patient warm and rested. Insert an NG tube if vomiting and a urinary catheter if anuric (urinary retention may be significant). |
| Pitfalls:• Children with DKA are at higher risk of cerebral edema due to treatment of DKA with associated sodium, pH and glucose shifts. It is essential that a specialized team and monitored setting be used in pediatric cases. A diagnosis of DKA does not initially require detection of ketones. Routine detection of ketones may require both urine and blood testing over time.• For urinary ketones, Ketostix strips detect acetoacetate but not hydroxybutyrate; beware of false negatives. Acetone smell may be absent, undetected or unrecognized by some. Where available, use rapid serum beta-hydroxybutyrate testing.• Temperature may be low initially—absence of fever does not rule out infection. • Leukocytosis is usually present and does not necessarily mean infection.• Low serum sodium may be due to pseudohyponatremia from high glucose or TG. • High serum potassium is caused by acidosis and may be seen in spite of severe total body potassium depletion.• Dehydration may mask a respiratory infection; reassess after rehydration and stabilization.• Severe abdominal pain or signs of an acute abdomen need to be reassessed after stabilization—they often disappear.• A premature switch to SC insulin and/or discharge results in high recurrence and readmission rates. |
