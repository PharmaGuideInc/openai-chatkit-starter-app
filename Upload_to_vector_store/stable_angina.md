#### Introduction

Angina pectoris is a discomfort, classically described as a “squeezing,” felt in the chest and/or an adjacent area caused by myocardial ischemia, i.e., an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle for a given demand. Coronary artery disease (CAD)—the build-up of cholesterol plaque in the walls of the vessels that feed the heart—is the most common underlying cause of myocardial ischemia. Stable angina refers to a syndrome in which the anginal chest discomfort occurs in a predictable pattern, typically precipitated by physical exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Stable angina is the classic way in which stable CAD can manifest clinically, but it can also present in other ways. These include heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to obstructive CAD; stabilized CAD after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a revascularization procedure, sub-categorized as either within 1 year or beyond 1 year; microvascular angina; and clinically silent CAD discovered incidentally or on screening. Together, these manifestations of stable CAD are referred to as chronic coronary syndrome. 

The therapeutic discussions in this chapter assume that CAD is the etiology of angina, unless indicated otherwise. Other conditions that can produce or exacerbate myocardial ischemia must be considered when evaluating a patient with angina pectoris, e.g., tachycardia, severe/uncontrolled hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anemia, and functional problems of the coronary arterial tree such as coronary artery spasm or microvascular dysfunction. Identifying these alternative causes of angina is important not only to allow appropriate treatments to be administered, but also to ensure that inappropriate treatments are not, e.g., a patient with angina due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be harmed by long-acting nitrate therapy.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Drugs That Decrease or Prevent Angina

Few randomized controlled trials compare anti-ischemic drugs (nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) in patients with angina.​[^[2]]​[^[3]] As such, it is reasonable to use any of these drugs. The choice of which drug to start with should include consideration of patient-specific factors and the mechanism of ischemia (see Figure 1, Table 2). Many cardiologists prescribe either a beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as first-line angina-prevention therapy because of their multiple (and similar) mechanisms of action. This is typically in addition to a short-acting nitrate to abort or, if taken before an activity, prevent an anginal episode. After first-line therapy has been optimized, second-line therapy might include the addition of a long-acting nitrate and, if first-line therapy included a beta-blocker, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.

Avoid beta-blocker therapy in patients with suspected or documented coronary arterial spasm (vasospastic angina); calcium channel blockers and nitrates are the agents of choice in such cases.

#### Nitrates

Nitrates are primarily venodilators. As a consequence, they reduce cardiac preload and, with it, myocardial oxygen demand. Nitrates are effective both to prevent anginal episodes and to treat acute attacks. Long-acting formulations delivered either orally or transdermally are typically prescribed to be used during daytime hours when people tend to be more active. Tolerance to the antianginal effects of nitrates develops unless a nitrate-free period of 10–12 hours is prescribed in each 24-hour period. Schedule the nitrate-free period for a time when minimal symptoms are expected, usually at night.

Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets or spray alleviate anginal pain. Studies suggest that the spray formulation is more effective and causes fewer headaches compared to the sublingual tablets.​[^[4]] When taken in advance, they can prevent symptoms that occur with activity.

Advise patients to sit when taking sublingual nitrates to reduce the risk of presyncope or syncope. All nitrates can cause headaches. 

#### Beta-Blockers

Beta-blockers decrease heart rate, contractility and blood pressure (the major determinant of left ventricular afterload). Therefore, they prevent or decrease angina by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Both nonselective and beta1-selective beta-blockers are effective. In patients with depressed left ventricular systolic function, beta-blockers also reduce mortality.

Do not withdraw beta-blocker therapy abruptly in patients who have been on chronic high-dose therapy, as this may precipitate rebound tachycardia and a worsening of anginal symptoms; taper the dose over a 10- to 14-day period.

#### Calcium Channel Blockers

Practically speaking, there are 2 classes of calcium channel blockers. The nondihydropyridines (verapamil and diltiazem) act more centrally and thus behave similarly to beta-blockers: they decrease myocardial oxygen demand by lowering heart rate, contractility and blood pressure. They are used as first-line antianginals because of their multiple additive mechanisms of action. Avoid verapamil and diltiazem in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and use with caution in patients with AV nodal disease.​[^[5]]

The dihydropyridines exert their effects primarily by arterial dilation. Amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine have been effective in stable angina, though felodipine does not have Health Canada approval for this indication. They reduce blood pressure and, consequently, myocardial oxygen demand. Furthermore, by dilating coronary arteries, dihydropyridines may also increase myocardial oxygen supply. They are typically used as second-line antianginals in addition to beta-blockers.

#### Ranolazine

Ranolazine reduces calcium overload in the ischemic myocyte by inhibiting the late sodium current (INa).​[^[6]]​[^[7]] It is approved as an add-on therapy for anginal symptoms or it might be considered in a patient who does not tolerate beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or nitrates.​[^[8]] Ranolazine is associated with QT prolongation and is used cautiously in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT (e.g., concomitant QT prolonging drugs).

#### Ivabradine

Ivabradine inhibits the If current in the sinus node to reduce heart rate and has previously been demonstrated to improve symptoms in patients with refractory angina.​[^[9]] It is approved by Health Canada for use in certain patients with heart failure and should only be used for stable angina in patients who also have heart failure. In the SIGNIFY trial, patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina scale ≥2 who did not have heart failure experienced a reduced heart rate as compared to placebo, but no benefit in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI.​[^[10]]

#### Other Agents

**Nicorandil** dilates both arterioles and, via its nitrate moiety, veins.​[^[11]] **Trimetazidine** inhibits fatty acid oxidation, thereby decreasing intracellular oxygen requirements.​[^[12]] These drugs are not approved for use in Canada. 

#### Drugs That Decrease the Risk of Cardiovascular Death and Nonfatal MI

Stable coronary artery disease has a relatively benign prognosis. It is the destabilization of coronary plaques that most commonly results in MI and/or death. Therefore, it stands to reason that agents that promote stabilization of coronary plaques, along with those that limit the thrombotic consequences when plaque rupture occurs, would be protective. Indeed, there is evidence from large, randomized controlled trials that patients with stable CAD can benefit from antilipidemic and antithrombotic therapies. Furthermore, other classes of plaque-stabilizing medications, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, as well as certain agents that target inflammation, have shown benefit in patients with CAD. 

#### Antilipidemic Therapies

The underlying pathology in the vast majority of individuals with stable angina is obstructive atherosclerotic plaque. Antilipidemic medications, most importantly the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), figure prominently in the management of patients with angina.

####### Statins

The mechanism of action of statins is not limited to reducing cholesterol levels and includes improving endothelial function.

The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial compared atorvastatin 80 mg to atorvastatin 10 mg in a population with stable CAD. The 80 mg dose resulted in a relative risk reduction of 22% for major cardiovascular events (absolute rates of 8.7% for 80 mg vs. 10.9% for 10 mg).​[^[13]] All patients with established vascular disease, including those with stable CAD and angina, are at an elevated risk of cardiovascular events; the use of a statin should be considered.​[^[14]] 

Current Canadian guidelines recommend that these high-risk patients be treated to ensure that their LDL is below 1.8 mmol/L or that it has fallen at least 50% on statin therapy.​[^[15]] 

####### Other Agents

Several other antilipidemic medications have been studied as add-on therapies in patients already on statins. These include ezetimibe,​[^[16]] the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab​[^[17]] and evolocumab,​[^[18]] and icosapent ethyl.​[^[19]] All of these agents have demonstrated a reduction in ischemic endpoints when added to statins in patients with documented CAD. The additional benefit offered by these agents is commensurate with a patient’s risk for ischemic complications.

For more information on statins and other medications to treat dyslipidemia, see Dyslipidemias.

#### Antithrombotic Agents (including Antiplatelets and Anticoagulants)

Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for all patients unless contraindicated.​[^[8]] A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that antiplatelet agents decrease the relative risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke by 30% compared with placebo.​[^[20]] It also showed that ASA 80–160 mg daily is as effective as higher doses. 

Clopidogrel, a P2Y12 adenosine receptor antagonist, has been compared to ASA in the management of patients with vasculopathy (CAPRIE trial).​[^[21]] Although there was a reduction of ischemic endpoints in favour of clopidogrel, it was limited to the subgroup of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The addition of clopidogrel to ASA alone has also been compared to ASA in a heterogeneous population of individuals with, or at risk for, vascular disease. Although there was no benefit to combination therapy in the overall trial,​[^[22]] there was benefit in the large subgroup of patients with established vasculopathy, including CAD.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Today, in the absence of a recent acute coronary syndrome or PCI with stent implantation, clopidogrel is reserved for stable angina patients who cannot take ASA. 

Three other P2Y12 adenosine receptor antagonists are available. The original, ticlopidine, is rarely used because of its GI and hematologic side effects (including rare but potentially fatal thrombotic thrombocytic purpura). Prasugrel has evidence of benefit in the setting of acute coronary syndromes, but it is not commonly used in the setting of stable CAD. The newest P2Y12 adenosine receptor antagonist is ticagrelor. It is different from its predecessors in several ways: it is structurally unrelated, it does not require hepatic activation, it binds to the P2Y12 receptor at a site distinct from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and it is a reversible inhibitor of ADP. Ticagrelor was tested in patients with stable CAD in the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial.​[^[24]] Two doses of ticagrelor were compared to placebo in over 20 000 patients with a myocardial infarction in the prior 1–3 years who were also taking ASA. Both doses provided a significant absolute risk reduction (ARR) of approximately 1% in cardiovascular death, MI and stroke, at the cost of an approximate 1% increase in major bleeding. Ticagrelor at the lower dose of 60 mg twice daily could be considered for secondary MI prevention in high-risk patients.​[^[24]]

The COMPASS trial documented a benefit to dual pathway antithrombotic therapy using combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone in patients with stable cardiovascular disease. ASA 100 mg daily plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke compared to ASA monotherapy (4.1% vs. 5.4%, P<0.001). There was more major bleeding documented in the dual pathway strategy (3.1% vs. 1.9%, P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in intracranial or fatal bleeding. Finally, all-cause mortality was lower in the dual pathway group than in the ASA-alone group (3.4% vs. 4.1%).​[^[25]]

As with all therapies, the advantages of dual antithrombotic therapy must be balanced against the disadvantages. The former will also be commensurate with the patient’s risk. The latter include not just the financial cost of treatment but the increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, treatment decisions must be highly individualized.

#### ACE Inhibitors and Other Non-Antilipidemic Plaque Stabilizers

ACE inhibitors have a number of potential anti-ischemic mechanisms including decreasing sympathetic adrenergic transmission, reducing blood pressure and afterload, and improving coronary flow reserve. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors have been shown to prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina who do not have heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.​[^[26]]

In the HOPE trial, which enrolled patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, ramipril 10 mg/day decreased the relative risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke by 20% compared with placebo in the subgroup of patients with angina.​[^[27]] Other large, placebo-controlled clinical trials of ACE inhibitors in lower-risk populations have yielded variable results.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Other indications for an ACE inhibitor should, of course, also be considered. For example, if a patient has hypertension in addition to stable CAD, an ACE inhibitor would be the antihypertensive of choice.​[^[30]] If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated due to certain side effects, e.g., cough, ARBs also have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ischemic complications in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, including CAD.​[^[31]]

Other agents with anti-inflammatory properties have been tested in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, including older drugs such as methotrexate​[^[32]] and colchicine,​[^[33]]​[^[34]]​[^[35]] and newer molecules including canakinumab.​[^[36]] Results thus far have been mixed. The role of drugs that target inflammation in the fight against atherosclerosis is yet to be established.

#### Drugs That Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular Death and Nonfatal MI

In postmenopausal patients with CAD, systemic hormone therapy should not be prescribed because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and a lack of benefit on MACE and mortality​[^[37]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]] (see Menopause). Similarly, **COX-2 inhibitors** and most nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of vascular events to varying degrees.​[^[40]] In those with established CAD, if the use of NSAIDs is required to maintain an adequate quality of life, administer the lowest dose for the shortest possible duration. 

#### Treat Modifiable Risk Factors

Observational studies have demonstrated that smoking cessation is associated with decreased mortality and morbid cardiac events. Pharmacologic interventions that improve smoking cessation rates include nicotine **replacement therapy**, bupropion, nortriptyline, clonidine and varenicline (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation).

The aggressive treatment of comorbid hypertension and diabetes mellitus is warranted. The reader is referred to the respective chapters on these subjects (see Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension) along with the current Canadian guidelines.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Two classes of oral hypoglycemic agents, the SGLT2 inhibitors and the GLP-1 agonists, have accumulated impressive bodies of evidence supporting their benefits in decreasing ischemic complications in patients with diabetes and established atherosclerotic vascular disease. These agents have thus positioned themselves right behind metformin as the preferred agents to use in this specific and large population of patients.​[^[43]]

Although observational studies have suggested that lower homocysteine levels and vitamin E therapy are beneficial for patients with angina, large randomized controlled trials have not shown any benefit to folic acid, B vitamins and vitamin E in patients with angina.​[^[44]]​[^[45]] The use of vitamin C, beta-carotene and omega-3 supplements are also not recommended.​[^[39]] In a randomized, controlled trial enrolling stable patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes and a history of MI, EDTA chelation was not effective in reducing cardiovascular events.​[^[46]]

       - Lingual spray: 0.4 mg every 5 minutes PRN.
     - If discomfort persists for 5 minutes after 1 dose, seek medical attention immediately.
     - Continue to a total of 3 doses until ambulance arrives.
   
   - **Chronic Treatment:**
     - Long-acting nitrate (oral or transdermal) and/or beta-blocker and/or long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB).
     - Avoid immediate-release nifedipine.

2. **Reduce Mortality and Prevent CV Events**
   - Unless contraindicated, start:
     - Antiplatelet agent (in all patients).
     - Statin (in most patients).
     - ACE inhibitor (in many patients).
   
   - Address any modifiable risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and glucose control, smoking cessation).
   - Where possible, stop:
     - Hormone replacement therapy.
     - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing stable angina pectoris, focusing on both symptom relief and long-term cardiovascular health.
