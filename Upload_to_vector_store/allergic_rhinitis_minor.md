#### Pathophysiology

Allergic rhinitis affects 10–30% of the population, and the prevalence is increasing.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] It is estimated that more than 500 million people worldwide are affected.​[^[3]] The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is thought to be highest in school-age children; 80% of people with allergic rhinitis are diagnosed before 20 years of age.​[^[1]]​[^[4]] Allergic rhinitis is associated with a genetic predisposition; children have a 30% chance of developing allergic rhinitis if one parent is affected and a 50% chance if both are affected.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

 Allergic rhinitis can have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life. Patients with allergic rhinitis report a lower overall sense of health than those without the condition. Up to half of patients report that allergic rhinitis has at least a moderate effect on daily life.​[^[7]]

Allergic rhinitis is characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa following inhalation of an allergen, e.g., pollen, indoor or outdoor mould, house dust mites, animal allergens or occupational allergens.​[^[1]]​[^[4]]​[^[6]]​[^[8]] The allergic reaction is mediated by antigen-antibody responses and takes place in 3 phases. The first phase occurs upon first contact with the allergen and is called sensitization; the second and third phases occur on re-exposure to an allergen in a sensitized individual:



Allergic rhinitis is classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) or persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR); these categories are defined as:​[^[3]]



Allergic rhinitis is further classified based on severity:​[^[3]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The sensitization phase of allergic rhinitis is asymptomatic. Symptoms of the second or immediate phase include sneezing, nasal and palatal pruritus, congestion, and clear rhinorrhea.​[^[7]]​[^[10]] Symptoms of the delayed phase are similar but nasal congestion predominates.​[^[4]]​[^[7]] Patients may also have itchy, red, watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis, see Conjunctivitis); itchy throat; ear fullness and popping; and a feeling of pressure over the cheeks and forehead.​[^[4]] Facial signs of allergic rhinitis are illustrated in Figure 1. The allergic salute is a sign more commonly seen in children, where the patient frequently wipes the nose with the palm of the hand in an upward motion.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration of a child's face, highlighting various signs associated with allergic conditions. The following features are labeled:

1. **Morgan lines (Dennie sign)**: Lines or folds under the eyes, often associated with allergies.
2. **Conjunctival injection**: Redness of the eye, indicating inflammation or irritation.
3. **Allergic shiner**: Dark circles under the eyes, commonly seen in individuals with allergies.
4. **Transverse nasal crease**: A horizontal line across the nose, often resulting from frequent nose rubbing.
5. **Ophthalmic tearing**: Excessive tearing from the eyes, a symptom of eye irritation or allergies.
6. **Open mouth**: Often seen in individuals with nasal congestion, leading to mouth breathing.

These features are commonly observed in individuals with allergic rhinitis or similar allergic conditions.

*AI-generated description for accessibility and content understanding*




Some patients present primarily with symptoms of sneezing and rhinorrhea, whereas others are mostly bothered by nasal blockage and have little or no itching or sneezing.​[^[6]] Eye symptoms are more commonly associated with animal and outdoor allergens.​[^[3]]​[^[8]]

 Patients may have headache, difficulty concentrating, low mood, fatigue or sleep disturbance.​[^[6]]​[^[11]] Malaise or fatigue may be presenting complaints in children.​[^[10]] Complications of allergic rhinitis include sinusitis, otitis media, asthma, snoring and sleep apnea. In children, there may be dental overbite and a high-arched palate due to chronic mouth breathing.​[^[3]]​[^[6]]

Rhinitis may also be nonallergic. Drugs associated with rhinitis are listed in Table 1. Conditions associated with nonallergic rhinitis are listed in Table 2.

An assessment plan for patients suffering from allergic rhinitis is illustrated in Figure 2. During the assessment, identify duration, frequency and severity of symptoms as well as precipitating factors and allergens, occupational exposure (e.g., dust, paints, adhesives), and response to current and previous therapy. When recommending treatment, consider the effectiveness and adverse effects of the proposed treatment alternatives, patient preference and cost.​[^[13]]

Consider the need for switching therapy or referral for allergy testing if the patient has already tried appropriate nonprescription therapy for 2 weeks without an adequate response or if the allergen responsible for symptoms cannot be readily identified.​[^[6]] Refer patients for further assessment if they have signs or symptoms that are unilateral or are not usually associated with allergic rhinitis (e.g., fever, facial pain, loss of smell or taste, recurrent epistaxis, purulent nasal or ocular secretions) or symptoms suggesting complications such as asthma.​[^[6]]

#### Prevention

Prevention is the first step in the management of allergic rhinitis. Although consensus is that improvement in symptoms should occur with allergen avoidance, little evidence supports individual measures.​[^[3]] While some measures such as washing pets, impermeable covers for bedding, and air filtration have been shown to reduce the allergen level, a corresponding reduction in allergic symptoms has not been shown.​[^[10]] The benefits of environmental control may take weeks or months to fully manifest. Avoidance measures for common allergens are presented below.​[^[1]]​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[8]]

#### Pollen



#### Outdoor Moulds



#### Indoor Moulds



#### House Dust Mites

Evidence suggests the best strategy is a combination of the following interventions:​[^[14]]



#### Animal Allergens



#### Occupational Allergens



#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For prevention measures for specific allergens, see Prevention section.

Tobacco smoke (first- and second-hand) can aggravate symptoms and should be avoided by all patients with allergic rhinitis;​[^[3]] for information related to smoking cessation, see Smoking Cessation. Other irritants that should be avoided include insect sprays, air pollution, and fresh tar or paint.​[^[3]]

Intranasal saline spray and irrigation has been shown to reduce nasal symptoms and the need for pharmacologic therapy in children and adults.​[^[15]] Either isotonic or hypertonic saline may be used; however, the optimal dose, frequency and delivery have not been established.​[^[15]] Patients should be reminded to use sterile saline for nasal irrigation to avoid infection.​[^[16]] The unused sterile saline should either be discarded at the end of the day or subjected to heat (e.g., microwave or boiling) each day to sterilize it (then left to cool). Individual unit-dose packages of saline can also be considered.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

When avoidance of allergens is ineffective or impractical and nonpharmacologic options are insufficient, consider pharmacologic options. If it is possible to predict the onset of symptoms (e.g., intermittent exposure), prophylactic medication should be started before exposure. Consider switching therapy if the patient has tried appropriate therapy for 2 weeks without an adequate response.​[^[6]]

Medications for treatment of allergic rhinitis, including their onset of action, are described in Table 5 and Table 6.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Cough, Cold and Allergy Products.

Several guidelines for the treatment of allergic rhinitis are available and each provides similar treatment recommendations (see also Figure 2):​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[8]]​[^[10]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]



Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic activity of different therapies for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

#### First-Line Therapies

#### Antihistamines

Antihistamines act as competitive antagonists for the histamine-1 (H1) receptor found on the surface of target cells in the nose, lung, conjunctiva and skin.​[^[21]] They also act as a reverse agonist, meaning that they change the three-dimensional configuration of the receptor, decreasing its affinity for histamine and down-regulating histamine-driven symptoms.​[^[21]] Antihistamines decrease nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, conjunctival itching and lacrimation but generally do not relieve nasal congestion. Desloratadine, fexofenadine and cetirizine have modest effects on nasal congestion.​[^[22]] Antihistamines are first-line treatment in mild cases of allergic rhinitis.​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[10]]

Antihistamines are divided into 2 major classes: **first-** and **second-generation**. All are similarly effective; however, adverse effect profiles and pharmacology differ.​[^[21]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Second-generation antihistamines are generally recommended over first-generation antihistamines due to similar efficacy and better adverse effect profile.​[^[28]]

Second-generation antihistamines are more selective for H1 receptors and less lipophilic. Consequently, they do not have significant anticholinergic adverse effects and do not cross the blood-brain barrier.​[^[26]] Use of cetirizine in standard doses is associated with more sedation compared with placebo, but less than first-generation antihistamines.​[^[6]] Administration of standard doses of bilastine, desloratadine, loratadine and rupatadine results in an incidence of sedation equivalent to placebo; however, drowsiness has been reported at higher than recommended doses, or rarely in susceptible individuals at recommended doses.​[^[6]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]] Fexofenadine appears to be nonsedating, even at increased doses. Due to their improved adverse effect profile, especially with regard to sedation and psychomotor performance, second-generation antihistamines are the drug of choice compared with first-generation agents for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.​[^[6]]​[^[19]] Clinical trials comparing various second-generation antihistamines demonstrate similar reduction of symptoms.​[^[2]]​[^[25]]​[^[27]]​[^[31]] They are less effective than intranasal corticosteroids for most symptoms of allergic rhinitis.​[^[6]] Two meta-analyses demonstrated intranasal corticosteroids were more effective than antihistamines for relieving congestion and sneezing; for ocular symptoms, no difference was found.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

First-generation antihistamines can decrease rhinorrhea, but mucus secretion may be thickened and can be more bothersome for some patients.​[^[21]] Adverse effects include dry mouth and nasal passages, difficulty voiding urine, constipation, CNS effects (sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment) and tachycardia;​[^[28]] in children, they may also cause paradoxical excitation​[^[34]] and impaired learning and academic performance.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] First-generation antihistamines should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease.

The intranasal antihistamine **azelastine** (available only in combination with **fluticasone** in Canada) is clinically similar to oral second-generation antihistamines for the relief of nasal symptoms.​[^[33]]

Antihistamines are more effective when taken before allergen exposure. The best results are obtained with chronic dosing compared with intermittent dosing; therefore, patients should take the antihistamine for as long as they are in contact with the allergen.​[^[19]] If one antihistamine is not effective, switching to another antihistamine may be beneficial.​[^[38]]

#### Corticosteroids

Intranasal corticosteroids are more effective against the nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis than oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal cromoglycate, and leukotriene receptor antagonists.​[^[32]]​[^[33]] Intranasal corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for moderate to severe or persistent allergic rhinitis, and for mild allergic rhinitis that does not respond to antihistamines.​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[10]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Some intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone, fluticasone **furoate**) have a modest benefit on allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.​[^[6]]​[^[14]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] A meta-analysis suggests that intranasal corticosteroids as a class are effective for ocular symptoms of allergic rhinitis; however, the magnitude of effect has not been quantified.​[^[42]]

The onset of action of intranasal corticosteroids is within 6–8 hours of the first dose, although maximum effect may take a few weeks. Patients may prefer intranasal corticosteroids in aerosol form compared with spray form; therefore, switching to another intranasal corticosteroid formulation may be recommended if patient tolerability is affecting therapy.​[^[43]] Regular use of intranasal steroids is more effective than intermittent use.​[^[19]]

Short courses of **oral corticosteroids** may be required for severe cases of allergic rhinitis that are unresponsive to other treatment.​[^[6]]

#### Second- and Third-Line Therapies

#### Mast Cell Stabilizers

Sodium cromoglycate (also called cromolyn sodium), an intranasal mast cell stabilizer, modestly reduces itching, sneezing and rhinorrhea but is not effective for nasal congestion.​[^[3]] Treatment should begin before exposure to the allergen and continue for the entire allergen season.​[^[37]] If treatment begins after allergen exposure, relief may be delayed up to 4 weeks. Sodium cromoglycate is less effective than corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis and has not been adequately compared with leukotriene receptor antagonists and antihistamines.​[^[6]]​[^[33]] Sodium cromoglycate is currently not available in Canada.

#### Decongestants

Decongestants are occasionally recommended as *adjunctive therapy* for patients with allergic rhinitis who experience nasal congestion; however, the risk of systemic adverse effects should be considered (see Table 5).​[^[6]] Decongestants are available in oral and topical formulations.

Oral decongestants generally have a weaker effect on nasal obstruction than the topical formulations.​[^[37]] Oral pseudoephedrine in combination with an **oral antihistamine** may be more effective than either medication alone for nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis.​[^[44]] Oral phenylephrine is no more effective than placebo for nasal congestion in allergic rhinitis and should not be recommended.​[^[45]]​[^[46]] Most available agents do not cause blood pressure elevations in normotensive persons unless the recommended dose is significantly exceeded.​[^[47]] Elevation of blood pressure may occur at standard doses in hypertensive patients.​[^[48]]

Systemic absorption from topical formulations is low, resulting in mainly local adverse effects (see Table 6). If used for the treatment of congestion with allergic rhinitis, intermittent use is recommended.​[^[6]] Rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound vasodilation) can occur if topical decongestants are used for more than 3–5 days.​[^[49]] Despite education, up to half of patients report using intranasal decongestants for longer than the recommended duration; overuse was less common in patients who were receiving appropriate treatment for allergic rhinitis (e.g., intranasal corticosteroid or oral antihistamine).​[^[50]] Overuse can lead to nasal congestion when the topical agent is stopped, and to permanent overgrowth of nasal tissue with chronic overuse. This condition is more likely to occur with shorter-acting agents (phenylephrine) than with longer-acting agents (oxymetazoline, xylometazoline). Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, including slow tapering of the decongestant, adding or switching to intranasal corticosteroids, or abrupt discontinuation of the topical decongestant. Abrupt cessation is effective but may be uncomfortable for the patient, as nasal congestion may persist for several days or weeks.​[^[49]]

#### Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRA)

Montelukast is superior to placebo but less effective than intranasal corticosteroids for nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis.​[^[33]] A meta-analysis suggests that antihistamines may be more effective than montelukast for daytime nasal symptoms and eye symptoms, but that montelukast may be more effective for nighttime symptoms.​[^[51]] 

Montelukast is more effective than oral antihistamines and comparable to intranasal corticosteroids for reduction of asthma symptoms and use of rescue asthma medication.​[^[33]] As a result, montelukast may be an alternative to INCS for allergic rhinitis coexisting with asthma.​[^[6]]​[^[8]]​[^[10]] Otherwise, montelukast is not recommended as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis.​[^[10]] Cases of neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including sleep disturbance, mood changes, and suicidal thinking have been reported and necessitate clinician monitoring.​[^[6]]​[^[52]]

Zafirlukast is no longer available in Canada.

#### Immunotherapy

Allergen immunotherapy is the only treatment that can modify the natural history of allergic rhinitis and potentially induce long-term disease remission after cessation of treatment.​[^[53]] According to clinical practice guidelines, allergen immunotherapy should be considered for patients who continue to have moderate to severe symptoms despite treatment or those who require systemic corticosteroids.​[^[2]]​[^[10]] Immunotherapy may be indicated when the exposure to allergens is significant and unavoidable (e.g., grass pollen) and when the symptom complex is severe enough to warrant the time, expense and small risk of anaphylaxis.​[^[6]] 

Immunotherapy may also prevent the development of new allergies and reduce the risk of development of asthma in children; allergen immunotherapy may be considered even in milder cases of allergic rhinitis in children.

Immunotherapy is available for administration by subcutaneous injection and via sublingual drops and tablets.

Further discussion regarding immunotherapy is outside the scope of this chapter; for more information, see the Allergic Rhinitis chapter in the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*.

#### Anticholinergics

Intranasal ipratropium is effective for rhinorrhea secondary to allergic rhinitis but not for other symptoms.​[^[37]] 

#### Natural Health Products

Most natural health products do not have adequate evidence to recommend their use. Butterbur has shown efficacy in some randomized controlled trials; however, the studied extract is not available in North America.​[^[54]]​[^[55]] There are also questions about the long-term safety of butterbur, as rare cases of hepatic injury have been reported with products containing pyrrolizidine alkaloid constituents.​[^[55]] Probiotic species including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium might provide some benefit; however, due to the heterogeneity among products studied in clinical trials and their conflicting results, it is still too soon to recommend probiotics for allergic rhinitis.​[^[56]]

#### Combination Therapies

Combination therapy is recommended by some guidelines when patients have inadequate response to monotherapy.​[^[10]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Some combinations have been shown to be more effective than monotherapy while others have not.

#### First- and Second-Generation Antihistamines

Some experts suggest a **second-generation antihistamine** during the day and a **first-generation antihistamine** at bedtime to promote sleep. Evidence to support this practice is lacking and next-day sedation is possible.​[^[2]] If sleep is disturbed due to allergies, symptom relief itself can be expected to improve sleep.

#### Antihistamine plus Decongestant

Because antihistamines may have only a modest effect on nasal congestion, antihistamines and decongestants are often combined. Some patients may respond to this combination when corticosteroids have failed or when either medication alone does not provide adequate relief of nasal symptoms.​[^[2]]​[^[33]]

#### Antihistamine plus Corticosteroid

Intranasal corticosteroids are often combined with oral antihistamines to treat severe or resistant cases of allergic rhinitis.​[^[6]] Evidence is insufficient to support this combination, as it has not been consistently shown to be superior to intranasal corticosteroid alone.​[^[2]]​[^[33]]​[^[57]] Thus, combination therapy with an intranasal corticosteroid and an oral antihistamine is not recommended for initial management of allergic rhinitis.​[^[18]]

In short-term studies, an intranasal corticosteroid in combination with an intranasal antihistamine (azelastine/​fluticasone) was more effective for the nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis than either medication alone.​[^[18]]​[^[33]]​[^[57]] Guidelines recommend that the combination of an intranasal corticosteroid and an intranasal antihistamine be considered as an alternative to intranasal corticosteroids monotherapy for the initial management of allergic rhinitis if the patient is willing to accept a higher cost and risk of adverse events.​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

#### Antihistamine or Intranasal Corticosteroid plus LTRA

An additive effect has been shown when **LTRAs** and either **oral antihistamines** or **intranasal corticosteroids** are used concomitantly.​[^[33]] The efficacy of oral antihistamines in combination with an LTRA is less than that of intranasal corticosteroids alone.​[^[6]] However, oral antihistamine-LTRA combination therapy may provide an alternative for patients who are unresponsive or nonadherent to intranasal corticosteroid therapy.

#### Special Populations

#### Children

The guidelines for treatment of allergic rhinitis in children are similar to those for adults; however, many of the allergic rhinitis studies exclude children <12 years of age.​[^[6]] Health-care practitioners must ensure they select the correct dosage and ensure proper administration to minimize adverse effects.​[^[3]]​[^[8]]​[^[34]] Table 5 and Table 6 provide dosage guidelines and age limits for oral and intranasal agents.

 Most **second-generation antihistamines** are now available in pediatric formulations for children >6 months and are generally preferred over first-generation agents due to improved adverse effect profiles. **Intranasal corticosteroids** are also effective and are considered safe in children >2 years of age, depending on the formulation.​[^[34]] Intranasal budesonide and mometasone have not shown growth suppression with prolonged use at recommended doses.​[^[6]]​[^[58]]​[^[59]]

Intranasal beclomethasone, fluticasone **furoate** and triamcinolone have been shown to reduce growth velocity by 0.2–0.9 cm per year within the first year of treatment.​[^[60]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]] Longer-term studies have not been conducted. If intranasal corticosteroids are used, use the lowest possible dose; monitor growth and use other therapies (e.g., antihistamines) to minimize the dose of corticosteroid required for symptom control.​[^[6]]

**Decongestants** are not recommended for use in children under 6 years of age.​[^[63]]​[^[64]] In those children, intranasal saline drops or spray may be used to clear nasal passages before eating or sleeping.

Similar to adults, montelukast may be a reasonable option for allergic rhinitis coexisting with asthma; however, monitoring for neuropsychiatric adverse effects is warranted.​[^[6]]​[^[8]]​[^[10]] Otherwise, montelukast is not recommended as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis.​[^[10]]

#### Pregnancy

Intranasal sodium cromoglycate (no longer available in Canada) and intranasal corticosteroids are both considered safe during pregnancy although beclomethasone, budesonide and fluticasone **propionate** have accumulated more safety data than other intranasal corticosteroids.​[^[6]]

Neither first- nor second-generation antihistamines have been associated with teratogenic effects in pregnancy.​[^[65]]​[^[66]] First-generation antihistamines were previously favoured because of substantially greater experience; however, safety data for cetirizine and loratadine​[^[67]] as well as desloratadine​[^[68]] now indicate that these are acceptable options. If possible, avoid the use of bilastine and rupatadine in pregnancy as no adequate nor well-controlled studies have taken place. Of the first-generation antihistamines, chlorpheniramine has a good safety record in pregnancy. Although diphenhydramine has good safety data and is still recommended and frequently used in pregnancy, there have been isolated reports of cleft palate.​[^[66]]

Oral decongestants should be avoided in the first trimester.​[^[66]] **Topical decongestants** may be used; at usual doses, they do not present a risk to the fetus. Immunotherapy generally should not be started during pregnancy. Courses of immunotherapy started prior to conception may be continued if beneficial and not causing systemic reactions; doses should not be increased during pregnancy.​[^[69]] 

For more information, see Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions.

#### Breastfeeding

Recommendations for breastfeeding are similar to those during pregnancy. Both **first-** and **second-generation** antihistamines as well as intranasal corticosteroids are considered safe while breastfeeding.​[^[70]] First-generation antihistamines may theoretically diminish milk production via their anticholinergic effect; however, this has not been reported in practice. Infant somnolence should be monitored when a first-generation antihistamine or cetirizine is used. If possible, avoid bilastine and rupatadine in the breastfeeding mother as no adequate nor well-controlled studies have taken place.

The systemic absorption of **topical** decongestants is low and transfer into breast milk is unknown. Consequently, these agents are expected to be reasonably safe during breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers pseudoephedrine to be compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[66]] Information on the use of other oral decongestants during breastfeeding is limited.

Information on the use of topical sodium cromoglycate during breastfeeding is not available, although the manufacturer recommends caution. It is currently not available in Canada.

For more information, see Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 4 provides a monitoring plan framework that should be individualized.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Allergic symptoms(sneezing, runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, congestion, rhinorrhea) | Patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: next visit or by telephone 1 wk later | Patient able to perform daily activities.Patient able to sleep. | If nonprescription therapy is ineffective after 1 wk, ensure allergen avoidance and medication dose (if applicable) are optimized. If symptoms not controlled after a further wk of therapy, consider another agent. Refer as necessary.​[3] |
| Drowsiness (antihistamine) | Patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: next visit or by telephone when checking for efficacy | Patient not drowsy during the day. | If using first-generation antihistamine, switch to second-generation antihistamine. If drowsiness continues, give dose at bedtime. |
| Insomnia (oral decongestant) | Patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: 1 wk | No insomnia. | Change medication schedule so last dose taken 4–6 h before bedtime or discontinue medication.See also Insomnia. |
| Elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients(oral decongestant) | Patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: monitor blood pressure of hypertensive patients twice in the first wk | No elevation in blood pressure above baseline. | Stop decongestant if blood pressure elevated above baseline.May consider switch to topical decongestant. |
