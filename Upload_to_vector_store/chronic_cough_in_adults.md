#### Introduction

Chronic cough (cough lasting >8 weeks) adversely affects quality of life and has an estimated prevalence of up to 20% in adults.​[^[1]] There is a very broad differential diagnosis given the ubiquitous distribution of cough receptors in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and other anatomic compartments. In nonsmokers with a negative chest radiograph who are not taking an ACE inhibitor, chronic cough can be attributed to upper airway cough syndrome (UACS; formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome), asthma, GERD or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) in the majority of cases (see Table 1).​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Nonetheless, cough is refractory to therapy in up to 40% of cases referred to specialty clinics.​[^[10]]

Chronic cough results from an interplay between airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and cough reflex hypersensitivity. The term unexplained chronic cough (UCC) has been proposed to describe a cough that remains unexplained after investigation and after supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines. UCC accounts for 5–10% of chronic cough cases.​[^[5]]

Other forms of cough that are not discussed in this chapter include:



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

A standardized approach (i.e., an anatomic diagnostic protocol [ADP]) will lead to identifiable cause(s) of cough in most patients​[^[12]]​[^[13]] (see ). More detailed testing (e.g., CT scan, bronchoscopy) should be reserved for those with no overt cause detected on initial evaluation and cough refractory to empiric therapeutic trials for the most common etiologies with clinical suspicion for other less-common causes (see Table 2).



| Common Causes | Clinical Features | Investigations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upper airway cough syndrome | Postnasal drainage; cobblestoning and mucus in oropharynxNasal dischargeThroat clearing | CT scan of paranasal sinuses (sinus x-rays often unhelpful)Nasal endoscopy |
| Cough variant asthma | Other typical features of asthma (such as wheezing) are often absent | Spirometry pre-/post-bronchodilatorMethacholine challenge (sensitivity 60–80%, specificity >90%), induced sputum for eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide |
| Gastroesophageal reflux disease | Consider after exclusion of other etiologiesUp to 50% of cases not associated with typical reflux symptoms​[6]​[7] | Gold standard for diagnosis lacking; options include:Upper GI series (limited sensitivity)pH monitoring/impedance (good sensitivity, moderate to poor specificity)Endoscopy is an option if pH monitoring not available (less sensitive)Therapeutic trial of H2RA or a PPI × 2–3 months; however, may require more than acid suppression |
| ACE inhibitor​[8] | Dry, nonproductive coughOnset hours to months postinitiationNo predisposing factorsClass effect of ACE inhibitors | Drug withdrawal; resolution or marked improvement of symptoms within 1–4 wk |
| Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB)​[9] | Often prolonged in postinfectious setting | Normal spirometry and chest x-ray, negative challenge testing, induced sputum eosinophilia, exhaled nitric oxide (if available)Therapeutic trial of ICS |

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Therapy of chronic cough is directed at the cause, once identified (see Figure 1, Table 3).



**Antitussives** have a limited role in the management of chronic cough; however, they may sometimes be used to enable sleep or in certain social settings (e.g., live theatre) if the cough cannot be controlled by measures targeted at a specific diagnosis. Use with caution when cough is productive.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) is common and is observed in up to 40% of cases referred to specialty clinics.​[^[27]] Use of the term cough hypersensitivity syndrome has been proposed to account for persistent cough induced by triggers that in most individuals would produce at most a more short-lived manifestation.​[^[28]] Hypersensitivity of afferent receptors may combine with central mechanisms to augment and perpetuate the cough. This has led to new approaches to therapy; for cough that is refractory to therapy, consider targeting cough hypersensitivity. Laryngeal dysfunction can respond to behavioural or multimodality speech pathology therapy.​[^[5]]​[^[20]] Cough receptor antagonists (e.g., P2X3 ion channel receptor antagonists) are under active study in refractory cough related to cough hypersensitivity. In adult patients with UCC and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (e.g., sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), guidelines state that inhaled corticosteroids should not be prescribed.​[^[5]]

Gabapentin (up to 900 mg twice daily) has been shown to improve cough-specific quality of life and is recommended as an option for patients with UCC.​[^[5]]​[^[29]] Gabapentin should be re-evaluated at 6 months and patients should be closely monitored for side effects. Pregabalin may be efficacious but appears to have more adverse effects and a greater abuse potential; this is hypothesized to be related to its rapid onset of action.​[^[30]] There is some evidence to support other neuromodulatory therapies. Morphine has been shown to reduce cough scores, but can require dose escalation and has abuse potential, particularly in longer-term use. Amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) may attenuate cough,​[^[31]] but lacks sufficient evidence to be included in guideline recommendations.​[^[5]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Information is limited regarding the prevalence, etiology and therapeutic options for chronic cough in pregnancy. Many of the common causes of cough can be exacerbated by pregnancy. This is most obvious for GERD because of smooth muscle relaxation and increased abdominal pressure. Lifestyle modifications and **antacids** are the first-line approach. There is considerable experience with **H2RAs** in pregnancy and these are generally considered safe.​[^[32]] There is less information for **PPIs** but similarly the data are reassuring.​[^[33]] For more information, see Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

Asthma and rhinitis may also be aggravated during pregnancy. The therapeutic approach to both UACS and asthma is minimally affected by pregnancy. **Short-acting bronchodilators** (e.g., **short-acting** beta2-adrenergic agonists) are widely employed and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended based on guidelines, although there is more evidence for some (budesonide) than others.​[^[34]] Oral **first-generation** antihistamines and oral decongestants may be used in pregnancy; however, avoid decongestants in the first trimester. For a more complete discussion, see Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma in Adults and Adolescents.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
