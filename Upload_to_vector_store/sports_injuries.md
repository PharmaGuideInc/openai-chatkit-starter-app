#### Introduction

The majority of sports injuries encountered in primary care settings involve the soft tissues (strains, sprains and contusions), bony anatomy (fractures and stress fractures) or joints (dislocations, degeneration and cartilage defects).

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

For management of specific injuries, see Table 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Acute treatment is best summarized by the RICE protocol:



Initial rehabilitation is directed toward allowing the injured tissues to heal. Aggravation of the injury must be avoided, but alternative activities should be encouraged, e.g., the runner with a stress fracture of the fibula should not run, but can swim or run in deep water. The next phase is directed toward restoring and improving range of motion, strength, endurance and proprioception. A progression toward full activity is then undertaken. Before the patient resumes activity, any factors that may have contributed to the injury (muscle imbalances, improper footwear, training errors, poor protective equipment) should be addressed, and sport-specific skills regained.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Oral or topical NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) can decrease swelling and discomfort but should be used for short periods only (for more detailed information on specific drugs, see Acute Pain). In the elderly, acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs should be considered for initial and ongoing treatment of persistent pain, particularly musculoskeletal pain. Elderly patients are more likely to experience adverse drug reactions; the benefits of NSAID therapy must be weighed against their potential risks (dyspepsia, GI bleeding, renal impairment, blood pressure elevation). For more information regarding risk-management approaches and risks associated with the use of NSAIDs, see Osteoarthritis. 

Intra-articular or peritendinous injection of corticosteroids such as triamcinolone **acetonide**, methylprednisolone **acetate** or betamethasone may be useful in treating specific injuries (see Table 1). These injections are used with some success but may have risks, especially following multiple injections or improper injection to a site, e.g., into the tendon. Ultrasound-guided joint and soft tissue interventions are preferable to palpation-guided injections in terms of improved accuracy, patient satisfaction and reduced complications.​[^[44]] A systematic review of peritendinous corticosteroid injections suggested that while there is good evidence of short-term benefit (pain reduction) in treating tendinopathies, the effectiveness of therapy varied with the injury site and evidence for long-term benefit is lacking (high risk of recurrence).​[^[11]]​[^[45]] See Osteoarthritis, Table 4 for more information on intra-articular corticosteroids.

Topical nitroglycerin patches effectively reduce pain associated with activities of daily living in patients with chronic tendinopathies.​[^[5]] Consider using one-quarter to one-half of a nitroglycerin 0.2 mg/h matrix patch (e.g., Nitro-Dur, Trinipatch) every 24 hours on the affected area, rotating the application site with each application. The most common side effect of a nitroglycerin patch is headache, but patients may also experience skin rash, dizziness and hypotension. Use with caution in the elderly or patients taking antihypertensives, due to the increased risk of orthostatic hypotension. Coadministration of nitrates (including topical) and PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is contraindicated. 

Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the source of chronic tendinopathy pain, including neuropathy as a contributing factor. Local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, is known to relieve pain by inhibiting the depolarization and firing of sensory nerve fibers through sodium channel blockade, a potential component of neuropathic pain.​[^[46]] Topical lidocaine may be effective for providing dermal analgesia and may play a role in the management of muscle/tendon and joint pain.​[^[46]]

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or autologous blood injections, supplement the inflamed tendon with natural growth factors to stimulate the healing process.​[^[47]] Platelet-rich plasma injections may become a cost-effective alternative to surgery in resistant and chronic tendinopathies. They have been studied for the treatment of specific tendon injuries with mixed results (see Table 1).​[^[48]]​[^[49]] Additional high-quality research is needed to assess the efficacy of PRP injections for the treatment of tendinopathies. Research examining the use of PRP in the management of knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) compared to other intra-articular therapies, such as cortisone, has shown that PRP is a safe treatment with potential to provide symptomatic benefit for OA in the short term (up to 12 months).​[^[50]] Further studies are required to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PRP, the patients most likely to benefit, and optimal PRP protocols.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The same principles of injury treatment apply to both nonpregnant and pregnant or breastfeeding athletes, with the following exceptions:  a clinical evaluation of each pregnant patient before recommending an exercise program. In the absence of absolute (e.g., incompetent cervix, multiparity, heart disease, bleeding) and relative (e.g., intrauterine growth retardation, poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes) contraindications to exercise in pregnancy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant patients continue and/or initiate safe physical activities.​[^[51]]

Participation in sports with a high risk of contact, falling or abdominal trauma should be avoided. Supine positions should be avoided, particularly after the first trimester, due to the potential for compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus, and the effect on the maternal cardiac output.​[^[51]] An increase in musculoskeletal injury rates during pregnancy has not been shown, despite increased ligamentous laxity found in pregnancy that is believed to be related to estrogen and relaxin; this is likely due to decreased participation in jumping, pivoting and contact activities in the later stages of pregnancy when this ligamentous laxity is greater.​[^[52]]

Moderate exercise during breastfeeding does not affect the quantity or composition of breast milk.​[^[53]]

For sports injuries in pregnancy and lactation:



A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Management of Common Sports Injuries

| Injury | Investigations | Therapeutic Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supraspinatus Tendinosis (Rotator Cuff Disorders)Tendinosis, degenerative tears, acute tears (partial or full thickness), less commonly overuse inflammation (tendinopathy) of the rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. These muscles act as movers (rotation, initial abduction) and stabilizers of the humeral head in the glenoid. Often results in subacromial impingement of supraspinatus (cuff muscle) and subacromial bursa. | History: Sudden pain if traumatic onset (e.g., fall), gradual onset of pain if tendinosis that radiates to the deltoid area. Discomfort noted with shoulder movement, especially reaching away from the body or overhead. Often painful at night with difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position. Weakness results if complete or significant partial tear.Physical examination: Wasting may be noted if full thickness tear. Pain on active ROM and resisted tests depending on injury type and location. Weakness is present with more significant tear. If subacromial impingement, often get “painful arc” in flexion or abduction, pain with Hawkins-Kennedy test (pain when shoulder placed at 90° of flexion and internally rotated). Test for glenohumeral instability.Imaging: X-ray if concern of bony injury (acute trauma) or osteoarthritis.Ultrasound good at detecting rotator cuff injury and bursitis. MRI can detect additional shoulder pathology.Refer if: X-rays show growth plate injuries in skeletally immature patients or fracture in patients >50 y. Acute full thickness rotator cuff injuries should be assessed by an orthopedic surgeon. | **NSAIDs** |
| Lateral Epicondylosis (“Tennis Elbow”)Tendinosis of the common extensor tendon at its origin at the lateral epicondyle. Medial Epicondylosis (“Golfer's Elbow”) Tendinosis of the common flexor/pronator tendon at its origin at the medial epicondyle. | History: Pain at the lateral elbow or medial elbow usually due to overuse and/or faulty mechanics.Physical examination: Tenderness just distal to the lateral or medial epicondyle, painful resisted wrist extension and grip (lateral epicondylosis), painful resisted wrist flexion (medial epicondylosis).X-rays: Rarely required (only if any concern about bony pathology; may confirm calcific tendinopathy).Refer if: Neurologic symptoms, loss of ROM in elbow (further evaluation needed to rule out pathologies, e.g., osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial tunnel syndrome, posterior interosseous nerve compression). | **NSAIDs** |
| Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (“Runner's Knee,” chondromalacia patellae)Anterior knee pain resulting from patellofemoral articulation dysfunction. | History: Anterior knee pain, worse with prolonged flexion/sitting, running, stairs.Physical examination: Impairments affecting the patellofemoral joint interface may be a consequence of muscle imbalance (weak VMO), tightness (hamstring or iliotibial band), malalignment i.e., increased Q angle. Pain with patellar pressure, medial quadriceps (VMO) weakness, lateral patellar tracking, poor control with single knee bends.X-rays: Include skyline view of patella if trauma or bony pathology is a concern or to assess for patellofemoral arthritis or other conditions.Refer if: Patient develops joint effusion. | **NSAIDs** |
| Lower Leg Pain(“Shin Splints,” tibial periostitis, medial tibial stress syndrome)Inflammation of the tibialis posterior at its origin or of the tibial periosteum. | History: Diffuse shin pain along the distal one-third of medial tibia, usually in inexperienced and/or inadequately stretched or strengthened athletes. Physical examination: Tenderness, usually diffuse, at medial border of tibia and adjacent muscle.If localized bony tenderness, rule out stress fracture.X-rays normal; may need bone scan to differentiate from stress fracture.Refer if: Lateral lower leg symptoms are not likely to be shin splints. Rule out possible exertional compartment syndrome. | **NSAIDs** |
| Stress Fractures of the Tibia or FibulaResult from repetitive subthreshold loading that, over time, exceeds the bone's intrinsic ability to repair itself. | History: Well-localized shin pain with pounding/impact activities, e.g., running, jumping, marching. Early on, pain is typically mild and occurs toward the end of the inciting activity. There is often a recent change in training surface (density or topography). Night pain is a frequent complaint.Physical Examination: Point tenderness upon palpation or percussion of affected area. Loading the affected bone using specific maneuvers (such as the "hop test" or the "fulcrum test") may reproduce pain. Imaging: X-rays usually negative until at least 2 wk after onset; may see periosteal thickening. Bone scan will show discrete increased uptake at stress fracture site.CT scan or MRI can help to differentiate acute vs. healing stress fracture.Refer if: Anterior midshaft tibial stress fractures (“the dreaded black line”), which appear as a horizontal fissure extending into the cortex of the tibia on x-ray. They are slow to heal, often go on to nonunion and should be assessed by an orthopedic surgeon for possible immobilization or internal fixation. | **acetaminophen** |
| Ankle SprainPartial or complete tear to ankle-stabilizing ligaments, most commonly lateral (anterior and posterior talofibular, calcaneofibular ligaments).Grade I: No laxity, weight bears without pain, minimal swellingGrade II: Possible slight laxity, painful weight bearing, swelling.Grade III: Significant laxity, unstable, significant swelling, complete disruption of at least 2 ligaments. | History: Acute inversion of ankle (eversion less common).Physical examination: Tenderness (most marked over injured ligament), swelling, pain with passive inversion and plantar flexion, positive anterior drawer test and talar tilt in Grade III sprains.Note: Don't forget to check for associated injury more proximally in the leg.X-rays: Clinical decision rules for the use of x-rays in acute ankle sprains are outlined in the Ottawa Ankle Rules.​[27]Refer if: Any suspicion of fracture, high ankle sprain/syndesmotic disruption, rupture of an Achilles or peroneal tendon (which require orthopedic surgery referral). | **NSAIDs** |
| Achilles TendinitisInflammation (tendinitis) or degeneration of the tendon's collagen in response to chronic overuse (tendinosis) of the Achilles mainly occurring at the insertion or distal aspect of tendon. | History: Pain, often swelling, of distal Achilles tendon. May be acute—usually caused by rapid increase in training/activity (e.g., running, jumping), poor flexibility/tight posterior chain, excessive pronation or poor-fitting footwear. Chronic tendinosis occurs usually in those >30 y. Sore first few steps in morning. Beware history of sudden acute pain (and occasionally feeling a “pop” or “snap”), which may indicate complete rupture of Achilles tendon.Physical examination: Occasional swelling of distal Achilles. When chronic, may have nodule/thickening of tendon with tenderness on palpation. Pain with passive ankle dorsiflexion and resisted plantar flexion (especially in weight bearing, painful toe raises). May have pes planus with pronation or pes cavus. Thompson test normal if Achilles is intact (patient supine, a squeeze of calf should produce ankle plantar flexion against gravity). If there is no plantar flexion, suspect complete tear of Achilles tendon.Imaging: If concern of possible tear/rupture, ultrasound helpful.Refer if: Concern regarding complete tear, immediate orthopedic surgery referral is needed to consider surgical intervention. | **NSAIDs** |
| Plantar FasciitisMicrotears and/or thickening of the plantar fascia and inflammation of the periosteum at its calcaneal origin (heel bone). | History: Pain at plantar aspect of calcaneus, worse with first steps of the day, getting up after prolonged sitting and pain with running, jumping or prolonged walking.Physical examination: Tender at plantar fascial origin at the heel; often tight plantar fascia and gastrocnemius.X-rays: Not usually required; may show “spur” as a result of more chronic plantar fascia tightness.Refer if: Severe bruising or swelling of the heel pad, which indicates a greater concern for plantar fascia rupture or calcaneal stress fracture, requires referral to a sport medicine specialist. | **NSAIDs** |
