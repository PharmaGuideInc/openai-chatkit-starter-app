#### Introduction

Fever is a regulated physiologic response in which a new thermal set point for body temperature is established by the hypothalamus. In response, the body establishes a new equilibrium of heat loss and production to maintain homeostasis at the higher temperature.​[^[1]] Fever is distinguished from disorders of temperature regulation, such as hyperthermia (see Heat-Related Disorders), where heat production exceeds heat loss without an increase in the thermoregulatory set point. Children <3 months of age and older adults (≥65 years of age) may not mount an elevated temperature in the presence of serious illness but instead may remain normothermic or develop hypothermia.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]



Malaise and fatigue may be seen with a higher temperature or may be due to the underlying illness causing the fever. Discomfort characterized as headache, backache, myalgia, arthralgia, somnolence, chills and rigors may be associated with fever.

There is no evidence that fever aggravates comorbid disease states in patients with heart or pulmonary insufficiency.

#### Pathophysiology

The thermoregulatory centre in the anterior hypothalamus normally controls core temperature within a narrow range by balancing heat production by muscle and liver tissues with heat dissipation from skin and lungs. With fever, the thermoregulatory set point is elevated.​[^[5]]​[^[10]] Endothelial cells of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, a network of enlarged capillaries surrounding the hypothalamus, release arachidonic acid metabolites when exposed to pyrogens in the circulation. Prostaglandin E2, released by the hypothalamus, is thought to be the major substance producing an elevation of the thermoregulatory set point. Initially, with an elevated set point, there is vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels to conserve heat, shivering to increase heat production, and behavioural changes such as seeking warmer environments and clothing. When the set point is reduced through administration of antipyretics or disappearance of pyrogens, the reverse occurs—vasodilation and sweating to dissipate heat, as well as behavioural changes such as removal of clothing.​[^[10]]

Sources of pyrogens (substances that cause fever) are both exogenous and endogenous.​[^[5]]​[^[10]] The most common exogenous sources are microorganisms and their products or toxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharide endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria). Exogenous pyrogens induce formation and release of endogenous pyrogens. Endogenous pyrogens or pyrogenic cytokines are polypeptides produced by host cell macrophages, monocytes and other cells. The most common are interleukin (IL) 1-alpha and 1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, IL-6, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNF) and interferon (IFN) gamma.

#### Patient Assessment and Investigations

Figure 1 presents an algorithm for the assessment of patients with fever. The term “red flag” is used to note when a serious underlying condition may be present. Investigations are needed before starting antipyretics.

Fever is a symptom or sign, not a diagnosis. Most commonly, fever is an adaptive response to an infection, often viral. Fever may also occur in malignancy or in rheumatologic or immunologic diseases. Children <6 months of age with a fever should be assessed by an appropriate health-care practitioner.​[^[13]]



Fever persisting >3 days in those >6 months of age, recurrent fever or high fever (>40.5°C) should be evaluated by an appropriate health-care practitioner (see Figure 1 for red flags).

Fever is one of the adverse effects that can occur with immunization. Studies on the use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen administered shortly before or shortly after immunization (prophylactic use) have shown no benefit with respect to the development of fever.​[^[16]]​[^[17]] If a fever develops post vaccine administration and the person is uncomfortable, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be administered.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Prophylactic analgesics have also shown no benefit with respect to reduction in pain at the time of vaccination​[^[20]] and are presently not recommended in the Canadian Immunization Guide.

Although uncommon, fever may be drug-induced; Table 1 lists medications that may be associated with drug-induced fever.

#### Measurement of Body Temperature

Measurement of core body temperature (e.g., viscera, major arteries) is invasive and impractical except in ICU settings; therefore the oral, rectal, axillary, temporal artery, tympanic membrane and transcutaneous routes are used to approximate core temperature. Different anatomic sites have different temperatures, so all are approximations of body temperature.​[^[5]] In adults and children >5 years of age, *oral* thermometry is recommended for confirmation of fever​[^[1]]​[^[4]]. In children ≤5 years of age, *rectal* thermometry is the gold standard in Canada for definitive measurement to reduce the instance of measurement error.​[^[4]] Other temperature measurement methods can be used as a screening tool for low-risk children; these include *tympanic* temperature measurement in children ≥2 years of age and *axillary* temperature measurement in children of all ages.​[^[4]] Invasive measurement of temperature in critically ill adults and children, and temperature control in this population, is beyond the scope of this chapter. 

| Method | Description | Instructions For Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rectal​[13] | Recommended for definitive temperature measurement in children <2 y. It is contraindicated in premature infants,​[5] the immunocompromised​[24] and in the presence of rectal anomalies, recent anorectal surgery or severe hemorrhoids. A rare complication is perforation of the rectum. | For children: place the child on their back with knees bent. For adults: lay patient in fetal position on flat surface.Lubricate anus and thermometer with petroleum jelly (pea-size quantity).With one hand, gently insert thermometer 2–3 cm into rectum.Hold buttocks closed against thermometer with other hand.Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Oral​[13] | Can be used in children >5 y and adults. Not routinely recommended in children <2 y. Using this method may not be possible in individuals who have difficulty understanding instructions, e.g., people with mental impairment or patients with dementia.​[5]Avoid the oral route when nasal breathing is difficult, e.g., due to viral upper respiratory tract infection; mouth breathing may cause spuriously low temperatures. Beverages, either hot or cold, and smoking should be avoided for at least 10 min prior to taking an oral temperature.​[5]​[24] | Place thermometer on either side of mouth (between gum and cheek) or under the tongue.Hold in place with lips or fingers (not the teeth).Have patient breathe through nose with mouth closed.Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Axilla​[13] | Axillary (armpit) temperatures are recommended for screening temperature assessment of low-risk children <5 y. Disadvantages of this route are the length of time needed to obtain a temperature and variation due to a number of factors including hypotension, cutaneous vasodilation and prior cooling of the patient.Although axillary temperatures are generally considered to be approximately 0.5°C lower than oral temperatures, reliable data are not available to support this correlation. The advantages of axillary temperatures are that this route is very accessible, safe and may be less frightening to children than rectal temperatures.​[24]The reading should be confirmed via another route if the axillary temperature is >37.2°C. | Place thermometer in apex of axilla.Have patient hold elbow against chest to stabilize the thermometer.Leave thermometer in place until it beeps and temperature is displayed. |
| Ear​[25] | The tympanic membrane and the hypothalamus share the same blood supply. The TT may better reflect core temperature measurements.​[5] The temperature is then converted by the thermometer to reflect oral or rectal temperatures, which may lead to some inaccuracy in the temperature reading. Proper placement in the ear canal is important.​[26] Improper placement can result in a lower reading that reflects the outer ear canal wall temperature.​[26] There may be a poor correlation between tympanic and rectal temperatures and a TT may not be sensitive enough to screen for fever in pediatric patients.​[27]​[28]​[29] Performance was good in adults, including older patients.​[30] The Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend a TT for children <2 y.​[13]Advantages of a TT include simplicity, speed and patient acceptance.​[24] Less than 2 s is needed to obtain a reading. Other advantages include lack of external influences such as hot beverage ingestion and no mucous membrane contact; therefore, there is a decreased risk of disease transmission.​[24] Acute otitis media and nonobstructive cerumen do not appear to affect the accuracy of a TT.​[31]A disadvantage is the high cost of the thermometer. | Follow specific manufacturer’s directions as they may vary.Before taking the temperature, ensure the ear is free from excess earwax.Apply a clean probe tip or lens filter.Turn the thermometer on.Gently tug on ear, pulling it back. This helps to straighten the ear canal so an accurate reading can be obtained.Gently insert the thermometer into the ear until the ear canal is fully sealed off; point straight towards opposite ear or temple.Push start button; it will beep when temperature is recorded. |
| Transcutaneous | “Fever strips” contain encapsulated thermophototropic esters of cholesterol (called liquid crystals) that change colour in response to temperature changes. They are easier to read and require less time than a standard thermometer, but are less reliable because skin temperature is not a reliable indicator of core temperature.​[5]​[13]​[24]​[26]​[32]​[33]When studied in emergency departments, fever strips were poor predictors of fever.​[33]​[34] Accuracy is affected by ambient temperatures such as cold hands holding the strip or nearby heat sources such as a lamp. A truly febrile patient may register as afebrile, possibly delaying medical attention. | Based on poor performance in studies, use cannot be recommended for children or adults. |
| Temporal artery (forehead)​[35] | Like the TT, the TA thermometer uses infrared technology to measure the temperature using a heat balance method.​[36]Infrared sensors compute a temporal artery temperature by rapid, repeated measures to synthesize skin surface and ambient temperature. It is similar to a TT in that it is very quick (3 s) and avoids any mucous membrane contact.​[36]It may be prone to less error than a TT​[37] but is not considered as accurate as rectal temperatures in children.​[37]​[38]​[39]A meta-analysis showed insufficient accuracy to substitute a TA thermometer for currently available temperature measurement methods.​[40] | Follow specific manufacturer’s directions as they may vary. Remove dirt, hair or sweat from forehead area.Turn unit on.Press button a second time.Position the device 0–2 cm away from the centre of the forehead just between the eyebrows. The device does not need to make contact with the forehead. A beep will sound when the temperature has been recorded. |

| Measurement Technique | Normal Temperature Range |
| --- | --- |
| Axilla | 36.5–37.5°C (97.8–99.5°F) |
| Ear | 35.8–37.9°C (96.4–100.2°F) |
| Oral | 35.5–37.5°C (95.9–99.5°F) |
| Rectal | 36.6–37.9°C (97.9–100.2°F) |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions for fever include removal of excess clothing and bedding, increased fluid intake to replace insensible water loss during fever, maintenance of ambient temperatures around 20–21°C, and avoidance of physical exertion.​[^[13]]​[^[41]]

Physical methods for heat reduction use convection, evaporation or conduction to counteract the body’s attempt to maintain a higher temperature set point (fever). The body opposes physical cooling by attempting to re-establish a high temperature through shivering and vasoconstriction,​[^[42]] which are uncomfortable and theoretically could increase metabolic work. Tepid sponging results in a decrease in body temperature; however, it is uncomfortable for the patient and the effect is of short duration. Antipyretics should be administered prior to physical cooling methods to reset the hypothalamic set point; otherwise, the body works to reach the higher set point. There are few studies comparing physical methods to antipyretics in children. Pharmacologic methods are preferred because they lower the hypothalamic set point.​[^[42]]

In the rare instance where core temperatures exceed 41–42°C, physical methods may be used in addition to pharmacologic methods. Given the increased risk of bacterial infections in patients with temperatures exceeding 41°C, these methods should be used outside of the hospital setting only after the patient has been investigated for serious disease.



#### Pharmacologic Choices

There are many arguments against treating a fever:​[^[5]]​[^[10]]​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]



Therefore, the decision to use antipyretics must be individualized. The goal should be reduction of fever rather than “normal” body temperature. Assessment of the patient should not depend solely on the elevation of temperature (see Figure 1).

Acetaminophen, ASA, ibuprofen and naproxen **sodium** are all currently indicated to reduce fever; however, naproxen is not indicated in children <12 years of age and ASA should not be used in children <18 years of age. Antipyretics reduce body temperature in febrile patients by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis in the brain and reducing the thermoregulatory set point.​[^[5]]​[^[45]] They do not lower normal body temperature. Short-term treatment with these drugs is associated with few side effects. Intermittent administration of antipyretics may result in drug-induced fluctuations in temperature and concomitant shivering, which may make the individual feel worse. Use at regular intervals may reduce patient discomfort and the risk of increased metabolic demand caused by shivering. However, it is not necessary to wake a person who is sleeping to administer antipyretics.​[^[4]]

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been studied in large populations and are considered safe in therapeutic doses.​[^[6]] National guidelines for children in the US and UK​[^[48]] recommend use of antipyretics only for the treatment goal of patient comfort. The dose, frequency of administration and adverse effects associated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen differ (see Table 4). With regard to efficacy in temperature reduction in children, one systematic review of randomized trials showed comparable efficacy of a single dose of either acetaminophen or ibuprofen in terms of pain relief, with about 15% more patients in the ibuprofen group having temperature reduction at 4 and 6 hours.​[^[51]] The clinical significance of these marginal benefits is unclear.

There is no evidence that reduction of temperature via antipyretic therapy is beneficial; thus, the main goal of antipyretic therapy in nonpregnant patients is patient comfort. In a pregnant patient who is in the first trimester, the goal of antipyresis is protection of the fetus.​[^[6]]​[^[52]]

In theory, antipyretic therapy may be justified if the metabolic demands of fever (increased metabolic rate, norepinephrine-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction, increased oxygen consumption) are greater than the clinical benefits.​[^[10]] As a result, textbooks still recommend aggressive antipyretic therapy in patients with underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease​[^[53]] despite the lack of evidence to support this practice. Similarly, antipyretics are recommended by some experts to reverse fever-induced mental dysfunction in older patients, but benefits of this practice have not been studied clinically.

Available antipyretics also have analgesic effects, which can decrease discomfort if present. Most guidelines for children recommend consideration of antipyretics only for febrile patients who appear distressed or unwell.​[^[6]]​[^[48]] Evidence indicates that antipyretic therapy does not prevent febrile seizures, a phenomenon that may occur in any patient but are most common in children about 6 months to 6 years of age.​[^[6]]​[^[54]]​[^[55]]

A response to antipyretic therapy does not exclude the possibility that serious underlying illness is present. Clinical decision-making should not be based on response to fever treatment.

While ASA may be used for fever in adults, it is not recommended in children or adolescents because of the potentially increased risk of Reye syndrome.​[^[56]]

Naproxen sodium is the most recent nonprescription NSAID available for fever. It has a longer half-life with a corresponding less frequent administration schedule. There are little data on the use of naproxen sodium for treatment of fever in children with viral infections. It is not indicated in those under the age of 12.

Some clinicians recommend alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen administration to reduce fever; however, there is insufficient evidence to support this as a routine practice and it is not recommended.​[^[6]]​[^[48]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]] While alternating or combining acetaminophen and ibuprofen may result in a greater period of time without fever, the clinical benefit of this difference is uncertain.​[^[59]] It is important to note that no difference was found in patient discomfort in the only 2 trials that assessed it.​[^[57]] This practice has not been shown to be either safe or more effective in improving discomfort than a single antipyretic. In addition, potential risks of prescribing 2 antipyretics may include dosing confusion and errors with associated toxicity.

Acetaminophen is safer than NSAIDs in older individuals who have risk factors predisposing to gastrointestinal and renal toxicity.

#### Optimizing Antipyretic Dosing and Administration in Children

In febrile children who do not have red flags (see Figure 1), review the following points with all parents when recommending an antipyretic preparation:



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Studies suggest that exposure to fever and other heat sources during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased risk of neural tube defects and multiple congenital abnormalities​[^[68]]​[^[69]] and, therefore, temperature reduction may be considered in these patients. Although one study indicated a possible benefit of antipyretic therapy,​[^[70]] others have not​[^[71]] and a meta-analysis suggests additional research is required.​[^[72]]

Acetaminophen has been commonly used and considered safe in pregnancy; however, its safety in pregnancy has been challenged by studies suggesting possible associations with neurodevelopmental problems.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]] The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists identifies acetaminophen as one of the only safe pain relievers in pregnancy and states there is no clear evidence of a direct link between acetaminophen use during any trimester and fetal development issues.​[^[76]] As with any drugs used in pregnancy, the drug should be clearly indicated and used for the shortest time necessary.

Use of **ASA** and **NSAIDs** can result in a number of problems during pregnancy such as interference of labour and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus resulting in many effects including persistent pulmonary hypertension in the infant. Platelet aggregation is inhibited in the newborn if ASA is ingested by the birth parent within 7 days of delivery and salicylates displace bilirubin from protein binding sites. Increased bleeding has been reported in both the birth parent and infant if ASA is ingested close to the time of delivery.​[^[77]] ASA and NSAIDs should be avoided in the first and third trimesters.​[^[73]]

Acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safe to take while breastfeeding; ASA should be used cautiously if used at all.​[^[73]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

A person’s temperature should be taken if they feel warm or look ill to determine the initial temperature. Subsequently, temperatures need not be taken more than 2–4 times daily unless the patient has recently received chemotherapy, for which referral to the emergency department is of utmost importance (see Figure 1 for red flags). Recommendations for frequent monitoring of temperature in children likely contribute to parental concern and fever phobia in pediatric patients. If fever has persisted for more than 3 days, or if the fever has persisted for more than 24 hours without an apparent cause, medical attention should be sought. The degree of illness and not the temperature should guide therapy and referral.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for managing a patient presenting with fever. It outlines decision points and actions based on specific criteria:

1. **Immediate Referral to Emergency Department:**
   - If any of the following are true:
     - Age < 3 months
     - Fever persisting > 72 hours
     - Presence of stiff neck, seizure, localized pain, redness, swelling, or heat
     - New wheeze/cough
     - New onset rash and fever
     - Difficult to rouse, confused, or delirious
     - Recent cancer therapy, e.g., chemotherapy
     - In children appearing very ill, excessively fussy, irritable, crying inconsolably, or other symptoms worrying the parents

2. **Assessment for Additional Red Flags:**
   - If none of the above are true, check for:
     - Age < 6 months
     - Fever > 40.5°C
     - Persistent wheeze/cough
     - Presence of serious underlying illness
     - Recent surgery or dental procedure
     - Recent travel
     - Recent consumption of raw or undercooked meat or fish
     - Recent initiation of new medication
   - If any red flags are present, refer for immediate examination by a primary care physician or urgent care.

3. **Self-Care Comfort Measures:**
   - If no red flags are present and the patient requests advice on managing fever:
     - Antipyretic therapy is generally not recommended but can be used for comfort.
     - Additional comfort measures include:
       - Removal of excess clothing and bedding
       - Increased fluid intake
       - Ambient temperature set at 20–21°C
       - Avoidance of physical exertion
       - Case-by-case comfort measures like a heating pad for earache or a cold drink/treat for sore throat

4. **Monitoring Fever Persistence:**
   - If fever persists > 24 hours without obvious cause or new concerning symptoms arise, refer for further examination.
   - If no new symptoms and fever resolves after 72 hours, no further treatment is required. Discontinue antipyretic if used.
