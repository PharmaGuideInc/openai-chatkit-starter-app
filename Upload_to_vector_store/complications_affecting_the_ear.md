Ear piercing complications are common (up to 35% of patients) and most frequently include infection and allergic reactions to metals.​[^[1]] Mild redness, swelling and crusting is part of the normal course of healing post-piercing. Healing typically takes 6–8 weeks or longer depending on which part of the ear is pierced. To prevent infection, the piercing site should be washed twice daily with soap and water; alcohol is no longer recommended because of potential for excessive drying. If a mild bacterial infection develops secondary to piercing, it can be managed with local therapy (cleansing, warm compresses and topical antibiotics) without removing the earring (for more information, consult the Compendium of Therapeutic Choices: Bacterial Skin Infections). If the inflammation or swelling is significant, the earring may need to be removed, in which case, a ring can be made from a nylon suture material or a 20-gauge Teflon catheter with silicone tubing (available from surgical supply manufacturers) and inserted into the hole to keep it open.​[^[1]] Localized infections are most commonly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.​[^[1]] Piercings high on the ear can produce infections of the cartilage (perichondritis), which are much more serious because the auricular cartridge is avascular.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] If exhibiting excessive swelling and tenderness, or discharge or fever, refer the patient for further assessment and management. The risk of hepatitis B and C infection may be increased as a result of body piercing;​[^[4]] infectious disease experts recommend completion of hepatitis B immunization prior to body piercing.

Allergic contact dermatitis is managed by avoidance of the inciting compound (nickel or gold) and may include short-term use of a mild to moderate topical corticosteroid, such as hydrocortisone 0.5% or 1% or clobetasone **butyrate** 0.05%. For more information, see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis.

See Ear Piercing—What You Need to Know for recommendations to reduce the risk of ear piercing complications and information on caring for the ears post-piercing.

#### Foreign Bodies

Foreign bodies in the ear canal occur more frequently in children than adults.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Often the patient (or witness in the case of a child) will give a history of a foreign object entering the ear. Patients may experience pain, which may be dull or severe, a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear, and loss of hearing. Other signs and symptoms include swelling or redness of the ear canal, otorrhea and foul smell.

Foreign objects should always be removed by a health-care practitioner. If a patient attempts to remove an object by syringing, especially if the object is organic (e.g., bean, pea, insect), the object may swell when moistened and occlude the canal. If the object is sharp, it may scratch the canal or perforate the tympanic membrane. Cotton-tipped applicators may push the foreign object further into the canal. 

*Note:* insects may be particularly bothersome because of their movement; provided the tympanic membrane is not perforated, insects may be drowned at home by using a dropper to fill the ear canal with mineral oil, olive oil or baby oil before removal by the health-care practitioner.

#### Barotrauma

Otic barotrauma, also referred to as aerotitis media, occurs when an individual cannot equalize the pressure gradient between the middle ear and the atmosphere.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]] This occurs during air travel (descent) and underwater diving (descent). The eustachian tube closes, causing a painful pressure change in the middle ear and extravasation of fluid and blood into the middle ear space. Tympanic membrane perforation may result. The symptoms are a sensation of ear blockage followed by ear pain, tinnitus, vertigo and transient conductive hearing loss; clear or bloody otorrhea may also be present. With diving, tympanic membrane rupture may result in severe vertigo due to cold water entering the middle ear. This may become life-threatening due to disorientation.​[^[10]] The condition may last 2–3 days and usually resolves spontaneously. More severe injury can occur with deep sea dives. Occasionally, surgery may be required. 

Treatment of barotrauma includes analgesics for pain, **oral**​[^[11]] or **topical** decongestants​[^[7]] to encourage opening of the eustachian tube, and attempts to auto-inflate using the Valsalva maneuver (forced expiration keeping the mouth tightly closed and the nostrils pinched) or the Toynbee maneuver (holding the nose and swallowing hard with the mouth closed). The Valsalva maneuver may cause syncope or cardiac arrhythmia and should not be recommended to patients with cardiac disease.

If symptoms of barotrauma do not subside in 24 hours, or if bloody fluid drains from the ear, indicating a ruptured tympanic membrane, refer the patient for further assessment and management.

Poor functioning of the eustachian tube can result in failure of pressure equilibration during descent while flying or diving. This may be due to congenital and anatomic conditions, but upper respiratory tract infections, eustachian tube edema resulting from allergies, chronic middle ear disease and nasal chamber edema during pregnancy can also produce eustachian tube dysfunction. Flying or diving should be postponed in these individuals if possible. In some cases, diving may be contraindicated, e.g., if the tympanic membrane is perforated.​[^[13]]

The Divers Alert Network (DAN) has guidelines for flying after recreational diving. They suggest waiting 12 hours after a single recreational dive; for multiple dives in one day or multiple dives over multiple days, DAN suggests waiting at least 18 hours before flying. For dives requiring decompression stops, a wait time of at least 18 hours is recommended, although DAN states there is little evidence to support this recommendation.​[^[12]] More information on recreational diving can be found on the DAN website.

#### Prevention

Beginning early in the descent while flying, individuals should swallow, yawn and auto-inflate frequently. During sleep, the eustachian tube does not function normally; thus, individuals should ensure they are awakened prior to descent. Children can be given gum to chew or candy to suck; small children can be breastfed or given a bottle during descent to reduce discomfort. When diving, various techniques are used during descent, such as the Valsalva maneuver, yawning, swallowing or moving the jaw from side to side.​[^[10]]

Intranasal and oral decongestants are often recommended to prevent barotrauma (see Table 1). In adults, pseudoephedrine 120 mg sustained-release formulation taken 30 minutes before flying has been shown to reduce pain, blockage and hearing loss in individuals with a history of ear discomfort;​[^[14]]​[^[15]] an alternative dose is 60 mg of the regular-release formulation. The selected product should have sufficient duration of action to match the length of the flight; it is often the descent that causes problems. For short flights (<4 hours), oral decongestants may be administered 30 minutes prior to takeoff; on longer flights, pseudoephedrine should be taken 30–60 minutes prior to the anticipated arrival time. Drowsiness was the only adverse effect reported in clinical trials specific to barotrauma during air travel; data on insomnia were not presented.​[^[15]] In one study, oxymetazoline intranasal spray was not shown to be better than placebo during air travel.​[^[14]]

Decongestant use in children ≤6 years of age during air travel was deemed not effective in one trial;​[^[16]] Health Canada advises against their use in this age group.​[^[17]]

Pseudoephedrine 60 mg taken 30 minutes before diving decreased the incidence and severity of middle ear barotrauma in first-time divers.​[^[18]] For contraindications and precautions, see Table 1.
