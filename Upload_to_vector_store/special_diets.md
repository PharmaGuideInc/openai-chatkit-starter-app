#### Introduction

Some patients require diets that either restrict or enhance certain nutrients or food products to prevent or treat medical conditions.​[^[1]] Additionally, some patients may select certain diets in an attempt to achieve optimal health—sometimes grounded in evidence and other times not. The specific diets discussed in this chapter are supported by some scientific evidence, although this area is continuously evolving.

#### Sodium-Restricted Diet

Sodium is an essential nutrient required for a number of physiological activities.​[^[2]] The recommended sodium intake in otherwise healthy adults is 1.5–2.7 g per day (less than 1.25 teaspoons of table salt per day).​[^[3]] However, in North America the majority of adults consume excessive sodium, which can lead to negative health outcomes. The purpose of a sodium-restricted diet is to prevent accumulation of fluid and/or promote a net loss of excess body water. The diet is indicated in:



Most dietary sodium intake (75%) is from processed foods (e.g., fast foods, smoked and/or salted meats, canned or prepackaged foods, snack foods, salad dressings).​[^[11]] To lower sodium intake, patients may choose fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes or unprocessed low-fat dairy. Patients may also choose to consume limited amounts of unprocessed fish, poultry and lean red meats. Popular diets that contain low amounts of sodium include the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diet.​[^[11]] To limit the use of salt in cooking and at the table, patients may use salt substitutes (e.g., potassium chloride, KCl) or other seasoning options (e.g., herbs, spices, lemon juice, garlic) during food preparation. Salt substitutes are effective in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events.​[^[12]] Most salt substitutes contain less than 1 mmol of sodium per teaspoon but large amounts of potassium (30–50 mmol per teaspoon). Patients with renal disease should not use salt substitutes, as ingestion of additional potassium could result in hyperkalemia. 

Advise patients to read the Nutrition Facts table on food packages for sodium content. Sources of sodium include sodium chloride (table salt), celery salt, garlic or onion salt, sea salt, baking soda, baking powder, brine for pickling, soy sauce, substances with Na (abbreviation for sodium), monosodium glutamate (Accent or MSG), sodium benzoate, sodium citrate, sodium nitrate, disodium phosphate, and sodium gluconate.

Health Canada allows the following sodium-related label claims on food products:​[^[13]]



Note that 2.4 g elemental sodium = 6 g NaCl = 1 teaspoon of table salt.

#### Potassium-Modified Diets

The purpose of both high-potassium and low-potassium diets is to maintain normal potassium levels (3.5–5 mmol/L) in hypo- and hyperkalemic patients.

In patients with hypertension, evidence suggests that diet with increased potassium may reduce blood pressure and risk of stroke​[^[14]] and may be associated with lower risk of death and cardiovascular events.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] High-potassium diets may be indicated during use of certain medications such as potassium-wasting thiazide diuretics or antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin). 

Low-potassium diets may be indicated in patients with impaired renal function or those taking medications that increase potassium levels, such as potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors.​[^[17]] There is currently a lack of compelling evidence suggesting that dietary potassium restriction is associated with decreased mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] A wide variety of foods are high in potassium: fruits (e.g., bananas, oranges, grapefruit), vegetables (e.g., potatoes, spinach), fresh meat, diary products (e.g., milk, yogourt) and salt substitutes containing potassium chloride (KCl).​[^[19]]

#### Fat-Restricted Diet

While fat-restricted diets are often used for weight loss, it is overall calorie restriction (rather than simply fat restriction) that is responsible for resulting weight loss. Overall, fat-restricted diets are not intended to lower serum lipids (see Diets for Cardiovascular Diseases, Diet for Dyslipidemia), but instead to limit saturated fats in order to significantly decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.​[^[20]]

Fat-restricted diets may be used in the treatment of diseases of the hepatobiliary tract (gall bladder disease, chronic cholecystitis), pancreas (chronic pancreatitis), intestinal mucosa (GERD, Crohn disease, small bowel resection) and lymphatic system (intestinal lymphangiectasia).​[^[20]] Fat-restricted diets prevent symptoms of intolerance to high intakes of dietary fat (diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain) and control nutrient losses caused by malabsorption disorders.

Patients with fat-malabsorption disorders may be deficient in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). In severe fat restriction, patients may need to supplement protein.

#### Fibre-Modified Diets

Fibre is a substance found in plants that cannot be hydrolyzed by the digestive system. It is classified as soluble or insoluble based on physicochemical properties. Soluble fibre occurs as pectins (e.g., bananas, apples), mucilage (e.g., psyllium) and gum (e.g., oatmeal, legumes). Insoluble fibre includes cellulose (e.g., wheat bran, apples), hemicellulose (e.g., whole wheat) and lignin (e.g., potatoes). For a table of fibre content of common foods, see Constipation.

A fibre-restricted diet reduces the frequency and volume of fecal output while prolonging intestinal transit time and preventing blockage of a stenosed gastrointestinal tract. A fibre-restricted diet is indicated in the following conditions: diverticulitis (when symptomatic), stenosis of the intestine and acute inflammatory bowel disease (when symptomatic).​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

Patients can reduce fibre intake by including limited amounts of well-cooked or canned vegetables and canned, cooked or very ripe fruit products’ replacing whole-grain breads and cereals with refined products; and avoiding nuts, seeds and legumes.

A high-fibre diet increases fecal bulk, promotes regular bowel movements and blunts the postprandial blood glucose response.

High-fibre diets are indicated in:



Data regarding dietary modification for prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are conflicting, and recommendations are controversial.​[^[23]] When symptomatic, reduced dietary fibre may improve symptoms.​[^[35]] When the disease is stable, a high-fibre diet (as tolerated) may stimulate peristalsis and improve the tone of the muscular wall of the GI tract, especially the colon.​[^[21]]​[^[35]]

Increasing fibre consumption should be done gradually to minimize abdominal distress, bloating, flatulence, cramps and diarrhea. Adequate fluid should be consumed.

#### Iron-Rich Diet



There are 2 types of dietary iron:​[^[36]]



Dietary iron absorption is thought to be increased or decreased by food enhancers (e.g., vitamin C) and inhibitors (e.g., calcium, eggs), respectively. However, the impact of enhancers and inhibitors has little effect on most individual’s iron status.​[^[36]] 

#### Gluten-Restricted Diet

Gluten is a protein contained in wheat, rye, barley, triticale (a cross between wheat and rye), spelt and kamut. In patients with gluten sensitivity, ingestion causes damage to the mucosa of the small intestine, leading to a variety of GI symptoms (e.g., cramps, bloating, diarrhea) and nutritional deficiencies.

Patients with celiac disease and those who cannot tolerate gluten may effectively be treated with a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) to eliminate virtually all gluten intake (see Table 1).​[^[37]] Patients should carefully review ingredients lists on food, natural health products and drug labels to determine whether gluten-containing ingredients are present. With the exception of medications that contain wheat starch as excipient, the amount of gluten in most medications is likely to be very low and safe for intake by patients with celiac disease.​[^[38]] However, when several medications and supplements are taken, the total gluten content may exceed what is tolerated by patients with celiac disease.​[^[38]] For gluten content of specific pharmaceutical products, the manufacturer should be contacted.

#### Lactose-Restricted Diet

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Nutrition Products: Lactose Digestants.

Lactose is the main carbohydrate (disaccharide sugar [glucose and galactose]) found in dairy products and is digested by the enzyme lactase.​[^[41]] A deficiency of lactase results in lactose intolerance, which manifests as intestinal symptoms (bloating, flatulence, cramping, nausea and diarrhea). The purpose of a lactose-restricted diet is to reduce lactose intake in intolerant patients to a level that will prevent or reduce these symptoms while providing adequate nutrient intake.

 The 3 main types of lactase deficiency are:​[^[41]]



Lactose-intolerant individuals vary in their degree of lactase deficiency and thus in their ability to digest lactose. Total lactose avoidance is usually not necessary except in galactosemia.

Enzymatic lactase products break down lactose into digestible sugars—glucose and galactose. They are available in various forms: tablets, chewable tablets and drops and are usually taken with the first sip or bite of the dairy product.

Lactase-treated food products (e.g., milk, cheese, yogourt) contain negligible amounts of lactose. Lactose-intolerant individuals may meet their calcium and vitamin D requirements from other food sources (e.g., canned fish with bones, fortified beverages, beans, nuts), but supplementation may be required depending upon dietary intake and age.

Note: It is important to read ingredients lists on food and drug labels, as many fillers contain lactose. Though the lactose content of most oral medications is very small in comparison with the lactose content of food, patients with severe lactase deficiency may wish to avoid taking medications or natural health products.​[^[42]] For the lactose content of specific pharmaceutical products, contact the manufacturer.

#### Phenylalanine-Restricted Diet​[43]

Phenylalanine is an amino acid found in protein that is metabolized to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The absence of this enzyme is the result of a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). In patients with PKU, phenylalanine can build up in the blood and brain to toxic levels and affect brain development and function. PKU is detected by a simple blood test, which is part of the newborn screening panel in Canada and the United States and it is treated by strictly following a diet that is extremely low in phenylalanine, particularly during the years of growth and development.

Phenylalanine is present in significant amounts in high-protein foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans and nuts. The artificial sweetener aspartame also contains phenylalanine and should be avoided. Medications or health products containing aspartame should be identified and avoided, particularly children’s products.​[^[44]] A lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet is the mainstay of treatment. Special diets devoid of phenylalanine but containing protein, vitamins, minerals and energy (calories) can be used for life. Foods allowed include fruit, vegetables, juices, low-protein breads and pastas. A consultation with a dietician is highly recommended.

It is important for patients’ progress to be monitored through food diaries, monthly blood tests and regular follow-up care.

#### Purine-Restricted Diet

Purines include the nucleotides adenine and guanine. They are found in virtually all food, but are more concentrated in some (see Table 2). Purines are metabolized to uric acid, so a purine-restricted diet decreases blood- and urine-uric acid levels.​[^[45]] A purine-restricted diet is beneficial to patients with hyperuricemia, gouty arthritis and urinary uric acid lithiasis (in conjunction with medication).

In patients with a history of gout, acute purine consumption increases the risk of a recurrent attack fivefold.​[^[46]] Patients with gout should consume meat, seafood and alcoholic beverages in moderation, meet protein needs with protein-rich vegetables rather than animal products and use low-fat dairy products. Monounsaturated fats and complex carbohydrates are preferred and portion sizes and the content of noncomplex carbohydrates should be monitored to prevent the development of insulin resistance.​[^[47]]​[^[48]] For more information regarding dietary recommendations in gout, see Table 2.

Several studies have shown that patients with obesity are at an increased risk of developing gout.​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]] Expert consensus recommend weight loss in patients with obesity or excess weight.​[^[47]]

| Avoid | Limit | Encourage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organ meats high in purine content (e.g., sweetbreads, liver, kidney) | Serving sizes of beef, lamb, pork, seafood with high purine content (e.g., sardines, shellfish) | Low-fat or nonfat dairy productsBeans, lentils, tofu, and unsalted nuts and seeds |
| High-fructose corn syrup–sweetened sodas, other beverages or food | Servings of naturally sweet fruit juices, table sugar, sweetened beverages and desserts, table salt (including sauces and gravies) | Vegetables, fruits |
| Alcohol overuse (>2 servings/day for males and >1 serving/day for females) | Alcohol (particularly beer but also wine and spirits) | — |

#### Tyramine-Controlled Diet

Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic amine found naturally in some foods and created when food is cured, aged, fermented or spoiled. It is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase enzyme and prolongs the action of adrenergic transmitters also metabolized by this enzyme. Tyramine also stimulates transmitter release from adrenergic terminals, which can lead to an adrenergic crisis (sudden increase in blood pressure and tachycardia), particularly in the presence of MAOIs such as phenelzine or tranylcypromine. 

A tyramine-controlled diet aims to minimize consumption of foods containing tyramine. Patients taking MAOIs follow this diet to prevent hypertensive crisis and other adverse reactions associated with ingesting MAOIs in combination with tyramine. Historically, MAOI diets have been unnecessarily restrictive. Many foods that were once thought to be dangerous are now known to be safe.​[^[52]]



Some patients state tyramine as a possible trigger for migraine headaches; however, clinical evidence is lacking to support this claim.​[^[54]]

#### High-Calorie, High-Protein Diet

A high-calorie, high-protein diet provides caloric intake and nutrients in excess of usual requirements to prevent or treat malnutrition, promote weight gain, meet the need for increased nutrients, and optimize an individual’s ability to respond to medical treatment. This type of diet may be indicated for patients who have been diagnosed with a condition that may result in poor nutritional intake, e.g., cancer, HIV/AIDS, chronic GI problems, burns, trauma, renal dialysis, failure to thrive, preparation for planned surgery.

Calorie-dense and protein-dense foods are suggested, e.g., whole milk, peanut butter, nuts, seeds, beef, chicken, fish, pork and eggs.

#### Modified Consistency Diet

Overall, consensus is lacking surrounding terminology used to describe the viscosity of foods and liquids. The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) diet scale (see Figure 1) was created to gain consistency surrounding texture modified foods.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] Table 3 compares IDDSI-modified consistency foods and liquids.

#### Meal Replacements and Oral Supplements

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Nutrition Products: Adult Nutrition Products.

While some meal replacement products are nutritionally complete (e.g., Ensure), others require at least 1 regular meal daily to meet nutrient requirements (e.g., Carnation Instant Breakfast).

Oral supplements: Formulated liquid diets are nutritionally complete for oral or feeding-tube use. Some are modified for specific disease states. A multitude of nutritionally complete formulated liquid diets are available for oral use (e.g., Isocal) or tube feeding (e.g., Jevity). Elemental liquid formulas (e.g., Vital HN) are useful for patients with difficulties in digestion and absorption as they are readily absorbed. More specialized formulated liquid diets have been designed to fulfill the nutrition requirements of patients suffering from certain diseases (e.g., Pulmocare for COPD, Oxepa for ventilated patients).

#### Diets for Cardiovascular Diseases

For other general principles of healthy living for disease risk reduction, see Lifestyle Management and Disease Prevention and Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease. For a summary of the effects of dietary interventions on surrogate markers and patient orientated outcomes of cardiovascular disease, see Table 4.

#### Diet for Hypertension

Dietary modifications can help to prevent or treat primary (essential) and secondary hypertension.

Reductions in dietary sodium intake can reduce blood pressure.​[^[61]]​[^[94]]​[^[95]]​[^[96]]​[^[97]]​[^[98]] However, long-term effect on cardiovascular events and mortality is unclear (see also Sodium-Restricted Diet).​[^[99]] About 50–60% of the population is “sodium sensitive,” with blood pressure that responds to alterations in dietary sodium intake.​[^[100]] Sodium-sensitive persons are predisposed to hypertension because of inherited susceptibility and can benefit the most from sodium-restricted diets. Older adults and persons with hypertension or diabetes are more sensitive to changes in sodium chloride.​[^[101]]

The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is promoted to control hypertension; it limits sodium intake, encourages consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables, and suggests lower consumption of red meats and sugar.​[^[102]] The DASH diet is very similar to Canada’s Food Guide.​[^[103]]

The Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) recommends reducing sodium intake toward 2 g (5 g of salt or 87 mmol of sodium) per day to decrease blood pressure.​[^[104]] CHEP also recommends consuming a diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains, and protein from plant sources that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

#### Diet for Dyslipidemia

Dyslipidemia refers to high blood levels of LDL-C, triglycerides (TGs) or both, or low blood levels of HDL-C, all of which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary, which includes excessive dietary intake of saturated fat, cholesterol and trans fat. A modified diet can improve the lipoprotein and lipid levels of individuals with dyslipidemia and can help prevent and/or slow the progression of coronary heart disease (CHD).

Lowering total serum cholesterol and LDL-C decreases risk for fatal and nonfatal coronary events.​[^[105]] The 2021 update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the adult recommends the following dietary measures:​[^[20]]



Trans fats are formed from the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, which turns the oils into solids. Trans fats have been shown to raise LDL-C levels and decrease HDL-C levels. These fats are often listed as “partially hydrogenated oil” on food labels and are often found in vegetable oil shortening, hard margarines, commercially prepared baked goods, potato and corn chips, crackers, microwave popcorn, and deep-fried foods.

Saturated fats are the strongest contributor to elevated LDL-C levels. They are found primarily in animal foods (beef, chicken, pork, whole-fat dairy products, eggs and lard) and in some plant-based foods (coconut, palm and palm kernel oils, and cocoa butter). A study found that saturated fats on average contributed to 10.4% of daily total energy intake among adult Canadians, irrespective of BMI, gender, age group or education level.​[^[109]] Restricting saturated fat intake can achieve a 5–10% reduction in LDL-C.​[^[108]]​[^[110]] A large, prospective cohort study found that replacing 5% of energy intake from saturated fats with equivalent energy intake from polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates from whole grains was associated with a 25%, 15% and 9% lower risk of CHD, respectively. However, carbohydrates from refined starches or added sugars (e.g., sugar-sweetened beverages or foods) have been positively associated with a risk of CHD and should not be used to replaced saturated fat.​[^[111]]​[^[112]] 

Unsaturated fats include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.​[^[110]] 



Although dietary consumption is encouraged, PUFA and MUFA supplements are not recommended for the reduction of CVD events due to a lack of supporting evidence.​[^[20]] 

Health Canada requires food products to state fat content (saturated fats, unsaturated fats, cholesterol, trans fats) on the labels. Some guidelines to permitted food claims include:​[^[113]]



Beware of potentially misleading labels, such as: 



#### Diet for Diabetes

In many cases of type 2 diabetes, a healthy diet, along with exercise, can control the disease without the need for oral medications, as it is possible to control blood sugar levels with a healthy diet. Nutritional therapy can decrease HbA1c by 1–2%.​[^[114]] Dietary adjustments are recommended for individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.

Regular scheduling of meals helps to avoid sharp ups and downs in blood sugar. Individuals using insulin therapy should adjust their insulin based on the carbohydrate content of their meals. This involves carbohydrate counting where dietary fibre is subtracted from the total carbohydrates. Dietitians with expertise in diabetes management can help individualize nutrition recommendations and also provide information on carbohydrate counting and timing of insulin.

 Diabetes Canada’s 2018 clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes in Canada makes the following nutrition therapy recommendations:​[^[114]]
