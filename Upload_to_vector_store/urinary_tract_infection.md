#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Table 1 details the most common infecting microorganisms in patients presenting with urinary tract infection (UTI) and the recommended investigations. Relapse is a recurrence of UTI with the same organism due to persistence of the organism within the urinary tract, usually in the prostate or kidneys. Relapse usually occurs within a short period, e.g., 4 weeks, after treatment completion. Reinfection is a recurrent UTI with a new species or strain of organism, usually occurring >2 weeks after treatment completion; it generally follows ascension of microorganisms from the periurethral area into the bladder.

| Syndrome | Infecting Organisms​[a] | Urine Culture Indications | Microbiologic Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acute Uncomplicated UTI (Cystitis) |  |  |  |
| Occurs in women with normal genitourinary tracts. Some women have a genetic predisposition for recurrent UTIs. Behavioural factors promoting infection include sexual intercourse and use of spermicide or a diaphragm. Usual presenting symptoms include internal dysuria,​[b] frequency, urgency and suprapubic discomfort. Recurrences are common but of variable frequency. | Escherichia coli (80–90%)Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5–10%)Klebsiella pneumoniaeProteus mirabilis | Generally not recommended.Clinical diagnosis is reliable for most episodes.Culture if failure to respond to empiric therapy, early (<1 month) recurrence following therapy, diagnostic uncertainty or pregnant patient. | Presence of any quantitative count of a gram-negative organism or S. saprophyticus in a voided urine specimen with pyuria.Isolation of any other gram positive organisms (including group B streptococci or coagulase negative staphylococci) should be considered contamination. |
| Acute Nonobstructive Pyelonephritis |  |  |  |
| Classic presentation includes fever and flank pain with or without associated irritative urinary symptoms. Nausea and vomiting may be present.May occur in women who also experience recurrent uncomplicated UTIs but at lower frequency than cystitis.Patients who present with UTI with only lower urinary tract symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria occasionally have associated occult renal infection.Bacteremic infection occurs most frequently in diabetic women or women >65 y. | E. coli (90%)K. pneumoniae (5%)P. mirabilis (5%) | Always indicated.Obtain urine specimen before initiating antimicrobial therapy.Consider blood cultures. | ≥10​7 cfu/L​[c] in voided specimen. |
| Complicated UTI |  |  |  |
| Occurs in individuals with an abnormal genitourinary tract due to structural or functional abnormalities, including indwelling catheter.Virtually all episodes of UTI in men will be complicated.Patients may present with cystitis (lower tract) symptoms or fever/pyelonephritis.Management includes search for correctable anomalies; with persistent abnormalities, recurrent infection is common (50% by 6 wk post-therapy). | E. coli (50%)P. mirabilis (20%)Enterococcus faecalis (10%)Pseudomonas aeruginosaProvidencia stuartiiCitrobacter spp.Enterobacter spp.Serratia spp.Group B streptococcus | Always indicated.Obtain urine specimen before initiating antimicrobial therapy. | ≥10​8 cfu/L​[c] in voided specimen or any quantitative count for an “in and out” catheterized specimen. |
| Bacterial Prostatitis: Acute |  |  |  |
| Symptoms include acute onset chills, fever, perineal and low back pain, irritative and obstructive voiding. The prostate is tender, swollen, indurated and warm. Prostatic massage is not recommended because it may cause bacteremia. | E. coliEnterobacteriaceaeP. aeruginosaStaphylococcus aureusOthers | Always indicated.Obtain urine specimen before initiating antimicrobial therapy. | Urine culture >10​8 cfu/L​[c]; blood culture often positive; aspirate prostate abscess if present (<5% of cases). |
| Bacterial Prostatitis: Chronic |  |  |  |
| Common cause of recurrent UTIs in older men; increases with age. Intermittent urinary infection presenting as cystitis; history of recurrent UTIs.Symptoms of chronic prostatitis are not considered attributable to infection in the absence of microbiologic documentation (antimicrobial therapy does not improve these symptoms when compared with placebo).​[1]Prostate examination is usually normal. | E. coli (80%)Klebsiella spp.P. aeruginosaProteus sppOthers | Indicated if acute symptoms occur. | Post-prostatic massage positive urine culture with pyuria and negative midstream urine specimen. |
| Asymptomatic Bacteriuria |  |  |  |
| Microbiologic evidence for UTI in the absence of associated symptoms.Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in women; increases with age.In pregnancy, screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria at 12–16 wk. | E. coli (60–70%)P. mirabilisGroup B streptococcusCoagulase-negative staphylococcusOthers | Not indicated for asymptomatic patients unless they are pregnant or about to undergo an invasive urologic procedure. | ≥10​8 cfu/L​[c] in 2 consecutive specimens in women or 1 specimen in men. |

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

It has been suggested that increased water intake may decrease the risk of UTI recurrence, but clinical trials have been of poor quality and further study is needed.​[^[2]]

The use of spermicidal products is associated with recurrent UTI in women and should be avoided in those at risk of recurrence.​[^[3]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Treatment with antibiotics is the standard of care for those with severe symptoms, and all symptomatic patients should be offered antimicrobial therapy irrespective of symptom intensity. However, half of patients presenting with symptomatic acute uncomplicated UTI may become symptom-free within 7 days without using antibiotics, and about one-third may be willing to delay treatment.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

Compared with ibuprofen treatment, antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce the symptom burden in a higher proportion of patients, shorten the duration of symptoms and improve activity scores.​[^[6]] In addition, the treatment of uncomplicated UTI with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) versus antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of complications, including pyelonephritis. NSAID monotherapy should not be considered.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]

Figure 1 details the management of recurrent acute uncomplicated UTIs. lists the various presentations of UTI and the recommended empiric antibiotic regimens.Table 3 details the properties of common antimicrobials used in the treatment of UTI.

extended-spectrum beta-lactamase

sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim

urinary tract infection

#### Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and Trimethoprim

Sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) and trimethoprim are the drugs of choice for most UTIs if local rates of Escherichia coli resistance are <20%.​[^[11]] Both may be used as 3-day therapy for acute uncomplicated UTI. Resistance to SMX/TMP and trimethoprim is increasing and must be considered in individuals who have failed empiric therapy or who have had recent prior therapy with these agents. Use of SMX/TMP is limited by sulfa allergy; trimethoprim alone may be used in sulfa-allergic patients.

#### Nitrofurantoin

Nitrofurantoin is a potential first-line option in the management of uncomplicated UTI. A 5-day course of nitrofurantoin is as effective as a 3-day course of SMX/TMP in the treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI.​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] It is not recommended for treatment of pyelonephritis and is contraindicated in patients with ClCr <30 mL/min.​[^[19]]​[^[20]] Pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy occur rarely but are more common with long-term use. Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals is dosed twice daily and may be better tolerated than the standard macrocrystal formulation.

#### Fosfomycin Tromethamine

Fosfomycin **tromethamine** does not show cross-resistance with other antimicrobials, and most community-acquired bacterial strains are susceptible.​[^[11]] While it may be slightly less effective than nitrofurantoin, SMX/TMP or fluoroquinolones, it is recommended first line as a single 3 g dose for treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI.​[^[11]]​[^[18]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

#### Fluoroquinolones

The renally excreted fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and norfloxacin) are as effective as SMX/TMP for 3-day treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI due to susceptible organisms. Due to concerns about development of bacterial resistance and serious adverse effects (see Table 3), the risks associated with fluoroquinolone use outweigh their benefits in the treatment of women with acute uncomplicated UTI; they should be reserved for patients who do not have alternative treatment options.​[^[23]]

Single-dose therapy with fluoroquinolones is not reliable for Staphylococcus saprophyticus.​[^[24]] In addition, single-dose therapy may have poor patient acceptance because symptoms persist for 48–72 hours. Fluoroquinolones are important agents in the treatment of complicated UTI, particularly for patients infected with resistant organisms. Ciprofloxacin for 7 days is adequate therapy for mild to moderate presentations of acute nonobstructive pyelonephritis.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]

#### Cephalosporins

All cephalosporins, including cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime and cefazolin, are effective for treatment of UTI. They are not as well studied as SMX/TMP or fluoroquinolones and are somewhat less effective for acute cystitis, especially with short courses of therapy. Cephalosporins may also be associated with a greater likelihood of vulvovaginal candidiasis.​[^[27]] Third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime are effective agents for parenteral treatment of pyelonephritis.

#### Amoxicillin and Amoxicillin/clavulanate

Resistance of E. coli to amoxicillin limits its use; reserve amoxicillin for UTIs with streptococci or enterococci or when the infecting organism is known to be susceptible.

Amoxicillin is not recommended for empiric therapy of uncomplicated UTI, as it is less effective than other available agents.​[^[11]]

Amoxicillin/​clavulanate may be considered third line for uncomplicated UTI when the alternative agents cannot be used (see Table 2).​[^[28]] Amoxicillin/clavulanate is associated with substantial GI side effects (10–25% incidence).

#### Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin) remain the therapy of choice for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis requiring parenteral therapy. Most gram-negative organisms, especially in patients with community-acquired infections, will remain susceptible to these agents. Initial parenteral therapy is switched to oral therapy as soon as signs and symptoms have settled (72–96 hours). With such short duration of therapy, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are unlikely. Aminoglycosides are usually interchangeable for the treatment of UTI. Antimicrobial susceptibility and cost determine selection of an individual agent.

#### Carbapenems

Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) are beta-lactam antibiotics useful in treating severe UTI due to susceptible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] Risk factors for infection or colonization with ESBL-producing organisms are recent hospitalization, residence in a long-term care facility, prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and travel to countries where these strains are endemic. Meropenem, but not ertapenem, is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Carbapenems are available for parenteral use only. Excretion is mainly renal and dosage adjustment is required in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment to prevent drug accumulation.

Carbapenems may cause allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria) in <3% of patients.​[^[31]] The reported incidence of cross-allergenicity between penicillins and carbapenems is about 1%.​[^[32]] More common adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, thrombophlebitis and rash.

#### Natural Health Products

While cranberry products have been widely used to prevent UTI, the evidence from clinical trials is conflicting; therefore, cranberry juice, powder or tablets should not be recommended for the prevention of UTI.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] There is no evidence to support the use of probiotic products, e.g., containing lactobacillus species, to prevent or treat UTI.

#### Management of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

Asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the presence of bacteria in the urine (at a concentration ≥10​[^8] cfu/L) in the absence of symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common but should not be screened for or treated except in pregnancy or shortly before transurethral resection of the prostate.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]] Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant patients does not reduce the development of symptomatic UTI or its complications, but instead contributes to harmful outcomes including adverse drug effects, reinfection with more resistant bacteria and possibly an increased short-term incidence of symptomatic UTI.​[^[37]]​[^[39]] The inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria also contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance.

#### Management of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is defined as ≥2 episodes of acute cystitis within 6 months or ≥3 episodes within 12 months. Recurrences are the result of reinfection, with symptom resolution between episodes.​[^[40]] Figure 1 outlines the management of rUTI. 

*Patient self-therapy*: Self-therapy is a recommended treatment option for recurrent cases of acute, uncomplicated UTI.​[^[40]]​[^[41]] This is a collaborative approach between the patient and prescriber in which the patient is provided a prescription for antibiotic therapy and directed to initiate therapy at the onset of symptoms. Any of the first-line treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis may be considered for patient self-therapy, with second-line therapy reserved for those cases in which first-line therapies are not appropriate or not available (see Table 2).

*Post-coital prophylaxis*: Patients who experience repeated UTIs associated with sexual intercourse may benefit from intermittent antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrence.​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] Intermittent therapy consists of post-coital administration of a single dose of antibiotic chosen from the first- or second-line treatments for uncomplicated cystitis (see Table 2).​[^[40]]

*Long-term, low-dose prophylaxis*: Some patients experiencing rUTI will benefit from taking a daily low dose of antibiotics for an extended period, generally 6–12 months.​[^[40]]​[^[46]] Nitrofurantoin (50–100 mg once daily) or sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim (200/40 mg once daily) are the most commonly used therapies for long-term prophylaxis. Fluoroquinolones are effective but tend to be avoided due to the risks of increasing bacterial resistance and serious adverse effects (see Table 3).

The joint guideline of the American and Canadian Urological Associations recommends vaginal estrogen therapy for peri- and post-menopausal women with rUTIs to reduce the risk of future UTIs if there is no contraindication to estrogen therapy.​[^[40]] The guideline also allows the use of cranberry for prevention of rUTI but notes that the quality of evidence is low. In addition, the cranberry products used in many of the clinical trials are developed specifically for research with higher concentrations of the active ingredient (proanthocyanidins) than commercially available products, a further limitation to the use of cranberry for rUTI prophylaxis.​[^[40]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Management of UTI during Pregnancy

Screen pregnant patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria early in pregnancy (wk 12–16)​[^[35]] and treat if asymptomatic bacteriuria is confirmed on 2 consecutive cultures. If left untreated, bacteriuria in pregnancy can progress to pyelonephritis and cause adverse effects to the fetus.​[^[47]] Antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis, rate of preterm delivery and risk of low birth-weight babies.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Upon completion of therapy, follow-up with a urine culture 1–2 weeks later, and then monthly until the baby is born.​[^[48]]



#### Management of UTI during Breastfeeding

The American Academy of Pediatrics considers fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin), nitrofurantoin and **SMX/TMP** to be compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[62]] Amoxicillin and cephalosporins are also considered compatible with breastfeeding.

#### Prevention of UTI during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective to prevent recurrent symptomatic or asymptomatic UTIs in pregnant patients. Nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are preferred. The use of cranberry products is safe in pregnancy, but efficacy to prevent infection in this patient population is not known.​[^[33]]​[^[63]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
