#### Introduction



The age of onset of schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders is usually late adolescence/early adulthood. There is increased emphasis on earlier detection and intervention​[^[1]] because the duration of untreated psychosis can be associated with poorer outcomes in both the short and long term.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]

| Disorder | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Schizophrenia | Signs of illness for ≥6 months; psychotic symptoms (delusions and/or hallucinations and/or disorganized speech) for ≥1 month; social/occupational dysfunction |
| Schizophreniform disorder | Similar to schizophrenia except duration of illness <6 months and ≥1 month |
| Schizoaffective disorder | Uninterrupted period of illness in which symptoms of schizophrenia and major mood episode occur concurrently; during lifetime duration of illness, ≥2 wk of delusions or hallucinations in absence of major mood episode; major mood episode is present >50% of total duration of illness |
| Delusional disorder | Nonbizarre delusions for ≥1 month and patient does not meet criteria for schizophrenia |
| Brief psychotic disorder | Psychotic symptoms for ≥1 day but <1 month; may or may not be related to marked stressor; eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning |
| Substance-induced psychotic disorder | Delusions or hallucinations develop during or within 1 month of substance intoxication or withdrawal or are etiologically related to medication use and are not better accounted for by another psychotic disorder |
| Psychotic disorder associated with another medical condition | Delusions or hallucinations are a direct physiological consequence of a medical condition and occur in absence of delirium |
| Major depression or bipolar disorder with psychotic features | Delusions or hallucinations occur during a major depressive or manic episode |
| Psychotic disorder not elsewhere classified | Psychotic symptoms present but criteria for specific disorder not met or there is insufficient or contradictory information |


#### Prevention

Increasingly, research has focused on the identification and treatment of individuals who are at “clinical high risk” of developing a psychotic disorder or may be in the prodromal phase.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] 

Primary care providers can play an important role in early detection.​[^[8]]​[^[9]] A number of tools, including structured interviews and rating scales, have been developed to identify individuals who may meet the criteria for being at clinical high risk of progressing to a psychotic disorder.​[^[10]] Examples include the Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education (PRIME) screening test; the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS); and the Scale of Prodromal Syndromes (SOPS).

Common prodromal psychosis symptoms (in order of decreasing frequency) include:​[^[11]]



The primary goal of treatment for individuals who meet the criteria for a prodromal psychosis syndrome is to prevent the progression to psychosis and to alleviate current and distressing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Canadian schizophrenia guidelines recommend a staged approach, beginning with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and progressing to low-dose second-generation antipsychotics for those who do not respond to psychological interventions.​[^[12]] For more information on treatment options, see Therapeutic Choices.

If an individual is deemed to be at clinical high risk of developing a psychotic disorder or may be in the prodromal phase, referral to a specialized early psychosis program (if available), psychiatrist or community mental health team is recommended. The Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis, a national and bilingual organization of clinicians who are involved with early psychosis programs across Canada, also provides access to various tools and resources.

#### Choice of Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are effective in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.​[^[29]] Two major classes of antipsychotics are currently available in Canada: first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs).



| Receptor Antagonized | Clinical Effects/Adverse Effects | Antipsychotics Most Relevant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Note: individual drug actions cannot be predicted by receptor affinities alone, due to complexity of mechanism of action, drug metabolism and brain circuitry. Several adverse effects of APs are not clearly explained by receptor affinities (e.g., metabolic effects, CVD, mortality in dementia, seizures). |  |  |
| Dopamine (D2) | Antagonism of D2 receptors is the basic mechanism of action of all APs, since increased D2 activity in the mesolimbic tract of the brain may be related to positive symptoms of schizophrenia.Excessive dopamine blockade in other dopaminergic tracts of the brain may be associated with EPS, TD and hyperprolactinemia. | All APs have D2 antagonist activity (with the exception of third-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine).FGAs have a higher affinity for D2 receptors than SGAs and result in more dopamine-related ADRs.High-potency FGAs have a higher risk of dopamine-related ADRs.SGAs paliperidone and risperidone can also cause hyperprolactinemia.Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine are a partial dopamine agonists, but are less potent than endogenous dopamine and result in an overall antagonistic effect. |
| Histaminic (H1) | Sedation, appetite stimulation, weight gain. | More potential: low-potency FGAs, clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine.Less potential: aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, ziprasidone. |
| Muscarinic (M1) | Anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation). | Low-potency phenothiazines, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine.Avoid in those with significant cognitive impairment, dementia or delirium and in the elderly. |
| Noradrenergic (alpha-1) | Orthostatic hypotension. | More potential: low-potency FGAs, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone.Less potential: aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, lurasidone, paliperidone. |
| Serotonin (5-HT2A) | Antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors may increase dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical pathway (improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia) and the nigrostriatal pathway (decreasing risk of EPS). | SGAs have significant 5-HT2A antagonist activity.SGAs have a higher 5-HT2A/D2 ratio, which maximizes antipsychotic action while minimizing risk of EPS. |

#### Treatment Considerations

Tailor treatment to the specific phase of the disorder and to the patient’s signs and symptoms.​[^[30]]

#### Acute Phase (First Episode/Recurrent Acute Episode)

The Figure 1 algorithm illustrates the management of patients in the acute phase of a psychotic episode.



#### Stabilization/Stable Phases



#### Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics



#### Antipsychotic Polypharmacy



#### Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is commonly defined as a failure to respond (<20% reduction in positive symptoms) to 2 or more adequate trials (≥6 weeks) of non-clozapine antipsychotic medication.​[^[30]]​[^[66]] Clozapine is the only antipsychotic with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia​[^[21]] in reducing hostility and aggression,​[^[67]]​[^[68]] persistent suicidality, and all-cause mortality.​[^[69]] Patients successfully stabilized on clozapine have not been shown to benefit further from switching to any other antipsychotic medication or from the addition of a second antipsychotic.​[^[30]]

Clozapine is reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia due to the risk of agranulocytosis and the need for regular blood monitoring. A discussion on the assessment and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia is beyond the scope of this chapter, but may be found in the Canadian schizophrenia guidelines (see Suggested Readings).

extrapyramidal side effects

| Side Effects | Incidence, Assessment and Monitoring | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiovascular | Incidence: orthostatic hypotension is the most common AP-induced CVD effect, usually with low-potency FGAs and clozapine, but can occur with other SGAs. QTc prolongation may occur with chlorpromazine, pimozide and haloperidol. Among SGAs, ziprasidone has a greater (though modest) capacity for QTc prolongation. APs confer a dose-related increase in the risk of sudden cardiac death​[91] and an increased risk of MI.​[92] Clozapine is associated with an increased risk of myocarditis (especially in, but not limited to, the first month of therapy) and other CVD complications.Assessment: baseline vital signs; family history and medical history. In individuals at risk of electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia (e.g., history of kidney disease, diuretic therapy, water intoxication, eating disorders, prolonged vomiting/diarrhea, alcoholism), measure baseline electrolytes and correct abnormalities. The 2021 APA guidelines recommend baseline ECG in patients with cardiovascular risk factors for QTc prolongation and those starting chlorpromazine, pimozide or ziprasidone.​[24]Monitoring: vital signs at 12 wk then annually; monitor more frequently as indicated and when initiating clozapine until dose is stable; annual cardiovascular risk assessment. ECG as clinically indicated, with significant dose changes (chlorpromazine, pimozide or ziprasidone), with addition of other medications that can affect QTc in patients with cardiovascular risk factors for QTc prolongation or elevated baseline levels.​[24] For clozapine: troponin, CRP and ECG in presence of signs and symptoms of possible myocarditis. | Educate about risks and prevention of orthostatic hypotension.If symptoms persist, decrease dose of AP, if possible, or switch to another AP.Clozapine-induced myocarditis: discontinue clozapine immediately and consult cardiology.Despite these and other contributory CVD risk factors (e.g., metabolic), APs reduce overall mortality risk.​[93] |
| Dermatologic | Incidence: DRESS (rare) associated with several SGAs.​[94] Mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported.​[95]Assessment: rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes and swollen face; can result in injury to liver, kidneys, lungs, heart and pancreas. | Early recognition, stop AP, supportive care (see Drug-Induced Skin Reactions). |
| Dyslipidemias | Incidence: hyperlipidemia has been associated with clozapine and olanzapine. Increased triglycerides have been reported with quetiapine.Assessment: baseline fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides).Monitoring: fasting lipid profile at 12 wk after initiation of a new AP, then annually; more frequent monitoring if significant weight gain, and every 6 months if LDL and/or triglycerides above the normal range. | Educate on change in diet. Consult the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia.Consider switching to ziprasidone​[96]​[97] or another agent with lower risk (see Table 4). |
| Endocrine, sexual and urinary effects | Incidence: hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of high-potency FGAs, risperidone and paliperidone. Sexual dysfunction is associated with all APs and is not necessarily related to elevated prolactin levels alone. Urinary retention risk is greatest with drugs that have significant anticholinergic activity.​[98]Assessment: baseline functional inquiry including menstrual history and libido in women, and libido, erectile and ejaculatory function in men; baseline prolactin level in first-episode psychosis, before initiating an AP associated with hyperprolactinemia and when indicated.Monitoring: monthly for 3 months after initiating a new AP, then yearly. | Determine underlying cause of endocrine or sexual dysfunction and treat accordingly. Consider drugs for erectile dysfunction.For clinically significant hyperprolactinemia, reduce dose of AP; if dose reduction not tolerated (emergence of or increase in psychotic symptoms), consider switching to an AP not associated with hyperprolactinemia (see Table 4). |
| Extrapyramidal side effects (akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, tardive akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia) | Incidence: SGAs have a significantly reduced risk of EPS and tardive dyskinesia compared with FGAs.​[21]​[33]​[34]​[99]​[100] The incidence of TD is 5.5% per year with FGAs and 3.9% with SGAs.​[20]Assessment: ESRS is the recommended tool to assess EPS including tardive dyskinesia. Other tools include AIMS, BARS and SAS. Parkinsonism can be associated with dysphoria, decreased concentration and slowing of cognition. Akathisia (subjective and objective restlessness) is often misidentified as psychotic agitation, which can result in an increase in dose of the offending AP. Tardive dyskinesia consists of repetitive, involuntary choreoathetoid movements usually involving the buccal-oral-lingual musculature, face, trunk, extremities or respiratory muscles, and can be permanent and disabling.Monitoring: baseline assessment in AP-naïve first-episode patients, in multiple-episode patients when initiating a new AP, and in first-episode and multiple-episode patients whenever dosage of AP is changed. Monitor weekly for 2–4 wk or until EPS resolves; in stable patients, monitor for TD at every clinical encounter or every 6 months or more often in patients at higher risk (on FGAs, erratic medication adherence or intermittent treatment, female, age >55, diagnosis of an affective disorder, substance abuse, diabetes). | Prevention is key—use SGAs first line. If EPS occurs, reduce dose; consider switch to SGA if on FGA.​[24] If EPS persists, consider anticholinergics (benztropine, procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl). Prophylactic use of anticholinergics is not recommended.Akathisia: if dose reduction is not effective, beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol 10–120 mg/day) are treatment of choice with monitoring for hypotension. Benzodiazepines also provide symptom relief. Anticholinergics are ineffective.Acute dystonia (acute torticollis, oculogyric crisis): benztropine or diphenhydramine IM followed by reduction in dose or switch to SGA.Tardive dyskinesia: no evidence-based treatment; therefore, prevention is key.​[101] Use SGAs first line. Antiparkinsonian medications not effective and may worsen symptoms. If TD occurs, suggest consultation with a psychiatrist. Consider switching to an SGA. For persistent, severe TD, consider clozapine trial. There is limited evidence for use of tetrabenazine but it may considered if TD persists.​[24] |
| Glucose abnormalities | Incidence: both FGAs and SGAs are associated with greater risk of glucose abnormalities including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, new onset type 2 diabetes, exacerbation of type 1 diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis.​[102] Among SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine have the highest risk.Assessment: baseline fasting plasma glucose; HbA1c if difficult to obtain fasting plasma glucose; OGTT if evidence of impaired glucose tolerance; family history and medical history.Monitoring: signs and symptoms of emergent diabetes; fasting plasma glucose 12 wk after initiating new AP, then yearly; more frequent monitoring required if significant weight gain or if symptomatic; OGTT if evidence of impaired glucose tolerance. | Educate about signs and symptoms of emergent diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed, follow the Diabetes Canada guidelines for diabetes and mental health. Consider switching to another AP with lower risk (see Table 4). |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | Incidence: rare, but can occur with any AP at any dose and at any time.Assessment: physical exam with focus on level of consciousness; vital signs (fever, tachycardia, fluctuations in BP); look for evidence of severe muscle rigidity (not to be confused with cogwheel-type rigidity due to drug-induced parkinsonism) and elevated levels of creatine kinase and white blood cells. Risk factors include young age, male, neurologic disabilities, dehydration, agitation, exhaustion, and rapid or parenteral administration of AP. | Medical emergency: discontinue AP and provide supportive care (hydration and cooling).Dantrolene 2–3 mg/kg TID–QID IV (maximum 10 mg/kg daily) or bromocriptine 2.5–5 mg TID PO, increasing by 2.5 mg TID Q24H (maximum 60 mg daily).​[64] |
| Sedation and cognitive effects | Incidence: sedation is very common and can be disabling, especially when first starting AP or increasing dose. Low-potency FGAs and some SGAs are implicated. Cognitive effects are less common with SGAs, but can occur especially with SGAs with greater anticholinergic activity (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine).Assessment: daytime drowsiness, excessive sleep, cognitive “dulling”; obtain collateral information from caregivers and family; anticholinergics (for EPS) and antiepileptics (for mood stabilization) can worsen cognitive effects.​[105]​[106]Monitoring: weekly for first 4–6 wk after initiating new AP. | Use SGAs as first-line treatment to reduce risk of cognitive side effects.​[103]​[104]Use a low initial dose and gradual titration based on degree of sedation, especially with clozapine and first-episode psychosis (exceptions include quetiapine XR and ziprasidone, for which rapid titration is recommended).Give entire daily dose at HS if possible to reduce daytime drowsiness.Do not use anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents prophylactically; avoid prolonged use when treating acute EPS. |
| Weight gain | Incidence: for FGAs, the risk of weight gain is greatest with low-potency agents. For many SGAs, there is a higher risk of weight gain compared with FGAs (see Table 3); may be rapid and usually plateaus within 1 y.Assessment: baseline weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference.Monitoring: weight and BMI monthly for 6 months with new AP then every 3 months when on a stable dosage; waist circumference annually. | Prevention is critical, as weight reduction is especially difficult in individuals with mental illness. Educate about risk of weight gain and provide dietary and exercise counselling.If weight increases >7% over baseline, implement behavioural weight reduction program. If unsuccessful, assess risks/benefits of continuing current AP vs. switching to an AP with lower risk (see Table 4).In CATIE, ziprasidone was the only agent to show improvement in weight and metabolic parameters following a switch from another SGA.​[96]Dose reduction unlikely to result in weight loss.Addition of metformin can also be considered.​[20] |

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Prenatal and Perinatal Risk Factors for Schizophrenia

A number of prenatal and perinatal factors have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring to varying degrees. These include malnutrition, viral illnesses such as influenza, obesity, x-ray radiation, exposure to cat feces infected with *Toxoplasmosis gondii* protozoa, use of analgesics (e.g., ASA), season of birth (lack of sunlight exposure/vitamin D deficiency), maternal-fetal Rh incompatibility, low birth weight and obstetric complications (hypoxia).

#### Psychosis and Pregnancy

The onset of a first episode of psychosis during pregnancy is uncommon but if it occurs, it is considered a psychiatric emergency and requires treatment because of the potential adverse effects of psychosis on both mother and fetus. Patients who experience a psychotic episode during pregnancy have twice the rate of adverse outcomes including stillbirth, infant death, prematurity and small size for gestational age, even when controlling for other variables including age, education, smoking, marital status, parity and pregnancy-induced hypertension.​[^[107]]

Although patients with schizophrenia may have lower fertility rates compared with the general population, their relative fertility has increased since deinstitutionalization, possibly due to a change in drug selection. High-potency antipsychotics are prescribed less often or at lower doses, resulting in less effect on prolactin levels and ovulation inhibition. More recent studies have found similar numbers of pregnancies in patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population.​[^[108]]​[^[109]] Patients with schizophrenia also have higher rates of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies; less social support; poorer antenatal care; poorer nutrition; greater use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substances; and the majority experience intermittent loss of custody.​[^[110]] 

Patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders should receive counselling about contraception and pregnancy early in the course of their illness. If a pregnancy is planned, a consultation with a psychiatrist is recommended to evaluate the risks/benefits of maintenance antipsychotics during pregnancy. Pregnancy in a woman being treated for schizophrenia is considered high-risk; referrals to a mental-health clinic and obstetrician are recommended and, if possible, the pregnancy should be managed through a high-risk clinic.

#### Psychosis and the Postpartum Period

The rate of postpartum psychosis is 1–2/1000 births; it usually occurs within 2–4 weeks after delivery. This is a psychiatric emergency because of the rare but serious risk of suicide and/or infanticide. If hospitalization is required and the patient’s condition does not pose a risk to the newborn, the patient and baby should be kept together, ideally in a specialized unit.

In the postpartum period, the risk of relapse of schizophrenia and related psychosis is high (~24%) and is greatest during the first 3 months. Patients with schizoaffective disorder are particularly at risk.​[^[111]] If an individual has a history of postpartum psychosis, the overall risk of relapse in a subsequent pregnancy is approximately 35%.​[^[112]]

#### Antipsychotics and Pregnancy

There have been no randomized controlled trials of FGAs or SGAs in pregnant patients. Teratogenic effects, including major congenital malformations, have not been demonstrated with the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy.​[^[113]] A large cohort study demonstrated increased risk of withdrawal symptoms, neurological disorders and persistent pulmonary hypertension among infants exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy; absolute incidence remained low (<2%).​[^[114]] In terms of long-term effects, another large cohort study did not find increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD, autism) with antipsychotic use during pregnancy.​[^[115]] A meta-analysis found that patients who continued antipsychotics during pregnancy had an increased risk of gestational diabetes; olanzapine and quetiapine may be particularly problematic due to their metabolic adverse effects.​[^[116]]

While minimizing exposure to all medications is generally advisable in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, the risks/benefits of antipsychotic use and the choice of medication must be carefully weighed for each patient, considering factors such as severity of past psychotic episodes, vulnerability to relapse, remission versus ongoing residual symptoms, current substance use, level of functioning, availability of social supports and history of prior response including side effects (EPS, weight gain, diabetes).

For many pregnant patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, maintenance antipsychotics at the lowest dose possible to prevent relapse will be recommended, as maintenance therapy may ultimately reduce risks to the fetus associated with an acute psychotic relapse, such as exposure to higher maternal doses of medication.​[^[110]]​[^[117]]

#### Antipsychotics and the Postpartum Period

Because of the high risk of relapse in the postpartum period, restart antipsychotics immediately after the delivery if they were discontinued during pregnancy. Closely monitor patients maintained on low-dose maintenance antipsychotics during pregnancy for early signs of relapse, as an increased dose may be needed in the postpartum period. In infants exposed to clozapine in utero, a neutrophil count is recommended; in those exposed to high-potency antipsychotics in utero (third trimester), monitor for EPS for several days.​[^[73]]

#### Antipsychotics and Breastfeeding

Antipsychotics are generally passed into breast milk and are detectable at levels considered compatible with breastfeeding; however, data in this patient population is limited, and long-term studies are needed. ​[^[118]] With use of FGAs, drowsiness and lethargy have been reported, although many studies cite no adverse events.​[^[118]] Of the SGAs, olanzapine is the preferred agent in breastfeeding patients based on over 100 documented cases of low infant exposure.​[^[119]] Quetiapine also demonstrated low infant exposure, although the number of documented cases was lower than olanzapine. Risperidone was associated with more infant exposure than other SGAs and may not be a preferred option. Breastfeeding while taking clozapine is not recommended.​[^[73]]

There is no consensus regarding breastfeeding in patients being treated with antipsychotics; some experts recommend against breastfeeding until further data are available.​[^[110]] The potential benefits of breastfeeding must be weighed against potential adverse effects and discussed with each individual patient. If antipsychotics are used, monitor the infant for adverse effects such as poor feeding, lethargy, drowsiness and delayed developmental milestones.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use During Pregnancy and Drug Use During Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a detailed flowchart outlining the treatment strategy for using antipsychotics in patients, focusing on second- or first-generation antipsychotics. Here's a breakdown of the flowchart:

### Initial Recommendations:
- **Second- or First-Generation Antipsychotics**: Recommended as first-line treatment based on patient characteristics and drug side effect profiles.
  - **Start with low dose** and titrate slowly to therapeutic dose over 1–2 weeks.
  - **Exceptions**: Ziprasidone and extended-release quetiapine require more rapid titration; asenapine and lurasidone can start at the recommended therapeutic dose.
  - Consider long-acting injectable SGA for acute psychoses.
  - For **recurrent acute episodes**, FGA can be used if there's a history of prior response and no EPS or TD.
  - Use benzodiazepine for acute agitation and anxiety.
  - Use a hypnotic agent for acute insomnia.

### 4- to 8-week Trial:
- **No or limited response/intolerable side effects**: 
  - Start SGA (if not current therapy) or switch to a different SGA.
- **Effective/tolerated**: 
  - Continue antipsychotic medication at the lowest effective therapeutic dosage.
  - Monitor for response and side effects.
  - Expect gradual improvement over 6–12 months or longer.
  - Use psychosocial interventions.
  - Assess for comorbid conditions.
  - Treat with antidepressant if symptoms of major depression are present.

### Further Steps:
- **No or limited response**: 
  - Re-assess diagnosis, adherence to meds, substance use disorders.
  - Consider treatment resistance, schizoaffective disorder/bipolar disorder, or nonadherence/comorbid substance abuse.
  - **Treatment Resistance**: Clozapine recommended.
  - **Schizoaffective/Bipolar Disorder**: Add mood stabilizer (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lithium, valproic acid).
  - **Nonadherence/Comorbid Substance Abuse**: Injectable long-acting formulation recommended.

### 4- to 6-month Trial:
- **Partial response**: 
  - Seek expert opinion regarding augmentation strategies.
- **Effective/tolerated**: 
  - Continue indefinitely.

### Outcomes:
- **Symptom remission/functional recovery**: 
  - Continue antipsychotic medication for at least 1–2 years in first-episode patients with full remission.
  - At least 2–5 years if there is a long DUP, severe illness, history of aggressive or suicidal behavior, comorbid substance disorder, or slow response to treatment.
  - At least 5 years following 2 or more episodes.
  - Many patients will require treatment indefinitely.
- **Relapse**: 
  - Reassess and adjust treatment as necessary.

Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants; may potentiate antihypertensive drug effects; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, prednisone) may increase quetiapine levels; inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) may decrease quetiapine levels. | Sedation and cognitive effects may be more prominent due to antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties. |
| **quetiapine extended-release** (Seroquel, generics) | Initial: 300 mg QHS PO (200 mg for first-episode psychosis)Titration (rapid): may increase dose in increments of ≤300 mg/day at intervals ≥1 dayUsual: 400–800 mg/dayGiven as a once-daily dose, generally in the evening | Sedation, dizziness, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic aminotransferase elevation, headache, anticholinergic effects, increased risk of diabetes and dyslipidemia, possible increased risk of cataracts; may reduce thyroid hormone levels.DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants; may potentiate antihypertensive drug effects; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, prednisone) may increase quetiapine levels; inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) may decrease quetiapine levels. | Sedation and cognitive effects may be more prominent due to antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties. |
| **risperidone** (Risperdal, Apo-Risperidone, Risperidone, other generics) | Initial: 1–2 mg/day PO Titration: increase by 0.5–2 mg PO every 3–7 daysUsual: 4–6 mg/day PO Maximum: 10 mg/day and 8 mg/dose POFrequency: 1 dose/day, preferably QHS | Sedation, headache, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, rhinitis, anxiety, dose-related hyperprolactinemia, EPS.Risk of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome in patients undergoing cataract surgery who have been exposed to risperidone.DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants; may potentiate antihypertensive drug effects; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, prednisone) may increase risperidone levels; inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) may decrease risperidone levels. | Highest frequency of EPS among SGAs. |
| **risperidone long-acting injection** (Risperdal) | Initial: 25 mg IM every 2 wk (oral supplementation with current antipsychotic required for first 3 wk)Titration: depending on response, increase by 12.5 mg every 4–8 wkUsual: 25–37.5 mg IM every 2 wk; some patients can be maintained on a dose of 12.5 mg every 2 wkMaximum: 50 mg IM every 2 wk | Sedation, headache, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, rhinitis, anxiety, dose-related hyperprolactinemia, EPS.Risk of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome in patients undergoing cataract surgery who have been exposed to risperidone.DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. Adverse effects may be less severe compared with oral risperidone due to decreased peak to trough serum fluctuations. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants; may potentiate antihypertensive drug effects; inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, prednisone) may increase risperidone levels; inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) may decrease risperidone levels. | Highest frequency of EPS among SGAs. |
| **ziprasidone** (Zeldox, generics) | Start with 40 mg BID PO (20 mg BID for antipsychotic-naïve first-episode patients) and rapidly titrate in the first wk up to 120–160 mg/dayRecommended titration schedule for early psychosis outpatient:​[127]Day 1: 20 mg AM, 40 mg PMDay 2: 40 mg AM, 60 mg PMDay 3: 60 mg AM, 60 mg PMDay 4: reassessOnce-daily doses may be appropriate for some patients, but BID is typically required due to short half-life. Administer doses with food (see Comments) | Orthostatic hypotension, EPS, sedation, insomnia.Prolonged QTc-interval; contraindicated in patients with history of QTc prolongation, recent MI, uncompensated heart failure or with concomitant use of any other drug that prolongs the QTc interval.Rapid titration is recommended to avoid ziprasidone-induced “activation” syndrome consisting of anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, increased energy and hypomanic-like symptoms, which develop soon after treatment initiation and occur at the lower end of the dosage range (20–40 mg BID PO).DRESS is a rare but very serious adverse effect. Advise patients about antipsychotic-associated body temperature dysregulation and prevention of heat stroke, e.g., hydration, sun protection. | Contraindicated with any other drug that prolongs the QTc interval, such as antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol), lithium, methadone, venlafaxine. May potentiate antihypertensive drug effects. | Has agonist activity at 5HT1A receptors and, unlike other SGAs, has antagonist activity at 5HT1D receptors and moderate inhibition of synaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.Administer with meals of ≥500 kcal to maximize absorption and therapeutic effect. |
