#### Introduction

Rhinosinusitis, more commonly known as sinusitis, is defined as symptomatic inflammation of one or more of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.​[^[1]] This chapter focuses on **acute rhinosinusitis** in children and adults, which includes episodes lasting ≤4 weeks. By comparison, **chronic rhinosinusitis** refers to symptomatic inflammation that lasts ≥12 weeks, while **subacute rhinosinusitis** refers to episodes lasting between 4 and 12 weeks. Although patients with chronic rhinosinusitis may experience acute exacerbations, **recurrent rhinosinusitis** is defined as ≥4 discrete episodes of acute rhinosinusitis per year, without symptoms in between.​[^[2]] Acute rhinosinusitis is further categorized as bacterial or viral.​[^[3]]

Most episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). These viruses, most commonly rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus and parainfluenza virus, induce a local inflammatory response​[^[4]]​[^[5]] characterized by edema, mucus production and sinus obstruction.​[^[6]] In a small number of cases, this facilitates bacterial invasion of the paranasal sinuses. It is estimated that viral URTI is complicated by bacterial rhinosinusitis in only 0.5–2% of adult cases and 6–13% of cases in children.​[^[2]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

Although rare in healthy individuals (1 in 12 000 children or 1 in 32 000 adults), acute rhinosinusitis can lead to complicated disease (see Table 1), including:​[^[4]]



The rate of complications is similar in patients who are treated with antibiotics and in those who are not.​[^[2]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

The diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis relies on patient history and physical examination. In patients who do not present with features suggestive of complicated disease, additional investigations are not needed.​[^[6]] An assessment and management algorithm for patients with acute rhinosinusitis is presented in Figure 1.



Children with acute rhinosinusitis will often present with sudden onset of 2 or more of: discoloured nasal drainage; nasal obstruction, blockage, and congestion; and/or cough (day or night).​[^[6]]

In order to differentiate acute rhinosinusitis from allergic rhinitis, patients should be asked about the presence of sneezing, watery rhinorrhea or eyes, and nasal or ocular pruritis. Sinus pain or headache in the absence of nasal symptoms should prompt consideration of dental disease or headache syndrome.​[^[4]] Physical examination should seek to rule out complications (see Table 1), which tend to occur early in the course of the illness and are associated with severe symptoms.​[^[6]] Patients in whom a complication is suspected may require radiographic imaging (e.g., sinus x-ray, CT, MRI) or endoscopically guided culture of sinus aspirate.

Differentiating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from acute viral rhinosinusitis is challenging given the significant degree of symptom overlap. However, accurate identification of patients with bacterial involvement is crucial to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and subsequent development of antimicrobial resistance. While bacterial culture of the paranasal sinus cavity is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, direct sinus aspiration is rarely undertaken in uncomplicated patients presenting to primary care.​[^[4]] Nasal swabs are expected to be contaminated by normal flora, and results cannot be used to predict pathogens in the sinus cavity.​[^[16]] No individual symptom is diagnostic of bacterial involvement (e.g., fever also occurs in viral infection; the colour of nasal discharge reflects the presence of neutrophils rather than bacteria).​[^[2]] Similarly, radiography is unable to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections.​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Although C-reactive protein testing may increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, it has not been prospectively validated and, as such, cannot be recommended.​[^[18]]

Given the limited value of symptoms in differentiating bacterial from viral rhinosinusitis, clinicians are advised to rely on the time course of the illness to determine the likelihood of bacterial involvement.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed in patients in whom symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis persist without evidence of improvement for >10 days after the start of URTI symptoms or where symptoms of rhinosinusitis get worse within 10 days after an initial period of improvement (i.e., “double sickening”).​[^[2]] For more information, see Figure 1.

#### Principles of Therapy in Acute Rhinosinusitis

Given that the majority of episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are viral in nature, most patients are unlikely to experience any benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Approximately 70% of cases of acute rhinosinusitis will resolve within 2 weeks without antibiotic treatment.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]] In patients clinically diagnosed with acute rhinosinusitis, 19 people need to be treated with antimicrobial therapy in order for 1 person to benefit, while only 8 need to receive antibiotics for an individual to experience side effects.​[^[30]] Furthermore, given that complications are rare and antibiotics do not appear to prevent them, using antimicrobial therapy for the purpose of preventing complications is not routinely necessary.​[^[6]] Patients who have symptoms that suggest complicated disease (see Table 1) require further evaluation and, likely, antimicrobial therapy.

Symptom management only is the preferred initial strategy for patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis.​[^[2]]​[^[14]]​[^[31]] Antimicrobial therapy can be considered in patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (e.g., symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis that persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days; symptoms that get worse after an initial period of improvement). However, even in patients suspected of having bacterial involvement, antibiotics at the time of diagnosis may not be necessary.

 A trial of intranasal corticosteroids or **watchful waiting** with or without a rescue prescription are 2 strategies that may minimize antimicrobial use in the setting of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.



Ultimately, shared decision-making with patients is needed when choosing whether or not to start antimicrobial therapy at any time and must take into consideration the self-limiting nature of the illness, the low incidence of complications and the risks associated with antimicrobial therapy, including antimicrobial resistance, increased prescription costs, drug allergy, side effects and Clostridioides difficile infection.​[^[14]]​[^[30]]​[^[36]]

For a patient-specific infographic related to the benefits and risks of antibiotic use for sinusitis, see the Public Health Ontario website.

#### Symptom Management

**Analgesics/antipyretics** such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used for control of pain and/or fever associated with acute rhinosinusitis.

Although oral and nasal **decongestants** are commonly used, there are currently no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of decongestants in patients with acute rhinosinusitis.​[^[2]]​[^[6]]​[^[14]]​[^[37]] Use oral decongestants for symptom relief with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention or in those taking MAO inhibitors. Treatment with topical decongestant sprays should be limited to 3–5 days; extended use may result in rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion/hyperemia), which may be refractory to subsequent decongestant therapy.​[^[19]]

The efficacy and safety of nasal/oral decongestants have not been well studied in pediatric patients <12 years of age.​[^[38]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]] Adverse events resulting in emergency room visits due to the use and/or misuse of oral cough and cold preparations are highest among children <6 years of age.​[^[41]] In addition, overdose of oral cough and cold preparations, specifically pseudoephedrine, has been associated with death in several infants.​[^[42]] As a result, Health Canada issued an advisory in December 2008 instructing caregivers not to give certain nonprescription cough and cold medications to children <6 years of age.​[^[43]] Some clinicians further advise against their use in children <12 years of age.​[^[40]] Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of these medications before prescribing. In order to avoid overdose from multiple medications (including analgesic products) that contain the same ingredients, ask if the patient is taking other cough and cold preparations.

The use of intranasal corticosteroids **(INCS)** in acute rhinosinusitis may provide a small benefit.​[^[2]]​[^[4]] In a meta-analysis of 4 well-conducted, double-blind, randomized controlled studies of patients with acute rhinosinusitis, the overall rate of resolution or marked improvement of symptoms was 73% versus 66% in corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively.​[^[44]] In other words, for every 100 patients treated with INCS, only 7 additional patients had complete or marked symptom relief. Despite this modest benefit, some experts advocate the use of INCS as an antibiotic-sparing measure in mild-to-moderate cases.​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[45]] When the decision is made to use INCS, high-dose regimens (equivalent to mometasone 400 mcg/day) should be used, as lower doses are no better than placebo.​[^[44]] The cumulative steroid burden of additional INCS should be considered in individuals already receiving oral or inhaled corticosteroid therapy, particularly in children.​[^[46]]

Oral/systemic corticosteroids are not recommended in acute rhinosinusitis.​[^[6]]​[^[47]]

There is limited evidence to support the use of antihistamines in acute rhinosinusitis.​[^[48]] Furthermore, their use is associated with excessive dryness, thickened secretions and crusting.​[^[49]]

There is no evidence that mucolytics such as guaifenesin or cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan are useful adjuncts in acute rhinosinusitis.​[^[2]]​[^[19]]

#### Antibiotic Therapy

 Information about antibiotic therapy can be found in Table 2 and Table 3.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacteria isolated in children and adults with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis; these are listed in Table 2.​[^[19]]​[^[50]]

When antimicrobial therapy is indicated, the patient’s medication history should be reviewed. Treatment with an antibiotic in the previous 3 months is a risk factor for infection with S. pneumoniae that is resistant to that class of agent, particularly for macrolides and fluoroquinolones. If this is the case, select a different class of antibiotic.​[^[51]]​[^[52]]

Amoxicillin remains the first choice for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for the following reasons:​[^[2]]​[^[19]]​[^[32]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]]​[^[55]]



Although the 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology’s clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis recommends either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/​clavulanate as first-line therapy,​[^[2]] experts continue to recommend amoxicillin as first line because amoxicillin/clavulanate is more broad spectrum than amoxicillin, has increased potential for adverse effects and is more expensive.​[^[32]] For more information, see Failure of First-Line Therapy.

There are no clinically significant differences in outcomes among first-line and second-line broader spectrum antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[59]]

Macrolides, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP), cephalexin, cefadroxil and cefixime are not recommended for empiric monotherapy of rhinosinusitis due to their unpredictable/poor activity against S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae.

Patients who report allergy to penicillin should undergo a thorough allergy assessment. While there are alternatives available for patients who are truly allergic, over-reporting of penicillin allergy is frequent and these patients are more likely to receive less effective, more harmful and possibly more expensive second-line therapies.​[^[60]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]] For patients with true penicillin allergy, doxycycline has excellent activity against rhinosinusitis pathogens, such as beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-intermediate strains. For pregnant patients and children <8 years of age, in whom doxycycline is contraindicated, a cephalosporin may be needed; patients who have true IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins, including anaphylaxis, may be safely treated with cefuroxime, recognizing that first-line amoxicillin has superior activity against S. pneumoniae.​[^[63]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]]



#### Failure of First-Line Therapy

Amoxicillin/​clavulanate offers the most appropriate spectrum of activity and is the agent of choice when first-line antibiotic therapy fails.​[^[29]]​[^[54]] Patients who have failed a course of appropriately dosed amoxicillin may be more likely to have infection caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The addition of clavulanate provides excellent activity against these pathogens.

While levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have good coverage of the pathogens involved, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients with severe, documented allergy to beta-lactams who have failed first-line antibiotic therapy for the following reasons: 



Due to the fact that the risk of serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, Health Canada and the US FDA have determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with this condition who have no alternative treatment options.​[^[66]]​[^[67]]

| Clinical Presentation | Usual Pathogens | Recommended Empiric Therapy for Children​[a] | Recommended Empiric Therapy for Adults | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acute Rhinosinusitis, where antibiotics are indicated (see Principles of Therapy in Acute Rhinosinusitis)(symptoms <4 wk and ≤3 episodes/y) | Streptococcus pneumoniaeMoraxella catarrhalisHaemophilus influenzaeOccasionally Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobes | **amoxicillin** | **amoxicillin** | Refer to ENT specialist if ≥4 episodes/y.Advise patients that symptoms are likely to last 14–21 days. |
| Failure of First-Line Agents:(no improvement after 7 days of antibiotic therapy or clinical deterioration or recurrence within 3 months) | S. pneumoniaeM. catarrhalisH. influenzaeOccasionally S. aureus, S. pyogenes, anaerobes | **Amoxicillin** | **Amoxicillin** | Consider resistant organisms, especially penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae.Fluoroquinolone use should be restricted (see Table 3). |

#### Duration of Therapy

Optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is not well defined, but most patients can receive a 5-day course of therapy. Traditionally, anywhere from a 7- to 14-day course of therapy has been recommended.​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[53]]​[^[71]] Some prescribers continue antibiotic therapy until the patient is free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 days to ensure eradication of bacteria and to prevent relapse;​[^[19]]​[^[55]] however, short-course optimal dose therapy has been shown to be effective in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanate​[^[72]] or respiratory quinolones​[^[70]]​[^[73]]​[^[74]] for 5 days. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials compared short-course (3–7 days) therapy to longer courses (6–10 days) with the same antibiotic at the same dose in acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis and found no differences in clinical success, microbiologic efficacy, relapses, adverse events or withdrawals.​[^[75]] In a subanalysis of 7 trials that compared 5-day with 10-day regimens, clinical success was similar but adverse events were fewer with the 5-day course of therapy.

In adults with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis, a shorter treatment duration of 5–7 days is recommended and has advantages in terms of lower potential for development of resistance, better adherence, fewer adverse events and lower costs.​[^[16]]​[^[54]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]] If first-line therapy has failed, choose a different antibiotic and treat for 5–10 days with the new agent (see Table 2).​[^[16]]​[^[54]]

For children, data on shorter durations of therapy are lacking; therefore, it is still recommended to treat for 10 days.​[^[16]]​[^[54]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Acute Rhinosinusitis and Pregnancy

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause temporary nasal congestion and symptoms that mimic rhinosinusitis due to vasodilation and increased blood volume.​[^[20]]​[^[77]] Symptoms of this condition, pregnancy rhinitis *de novo*, usually disappear within 2 weeks after delivery.​[^[77]]

Bacterial rhinosinusitis has been reported to be as high as 1.5% in pregnancy, representing a 6-fold increase over the incidence observed in a nonpregnant population.​[^[78]] The peak onset is in the second trimester. Classic signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis are absent in nearly half of patients with documented purulent rhinosinusitis during pregnancy.​[^[78]]

Uncontrolled rhinosinusitis during pregnancy may aggravate coexisting asthma and can have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome and quality of life. Therefore, rhinosinusitis during pregnancy should be actively evaluated and treated to optimize pregnancy outcome.​[^[78]]

#### Management of Acute Rhinosinusitis in Pregnancy

Nonpharmacologic measures such as saline nasal irrigation​[^[78]] should be tried first. Acetaminophen can be used if an analgesic or antipyretic is necessary. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are an alternative to acetaminophen but are not recommended in the second half of pregnancy. Concerns regarding the use of NSAIDs include the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosis if used in the third trimester​[^[79]] as well as kidney dysfunction leading to low amniotic fluid levels if used ≥20 weeks’ gestation.​[^[80]]

As in the nonpregnant population, there is no evidence to support the use of decongestants for symptom management of acute rhinosinusitis during pregnancy.​[^[2]]​[^[6]]​[^[14]]​[^[37]] If used, **topical** decongestants are preferred over **oral decongestants** to lessen fetal drug exposure. Since pregnant patients have a tendency to develop rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion), likely due to hormonally induced congestion, topical decongestants should be used minimally (e.g., before bedtime to help with sleep) for no more than 3–5 days, preferably after the first trimester and not during labour.​[^[78]] Oral decongestants should be avoided in the first trimester because of a possible risk of gastroschisis, i.e., a rare birth defect involving the abdominal wall.​[^[77]]​[^[81]] There is no specific information available on the use of intranasal corticosteroids for acute rhinosinusitis during pregnancy, but very little (if any) would be expected to reach the fetus during maternal intranasal use because these drugs are poorly absorbed and undergo first-pass metabolism.​[^[78]]

As in the general population, amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in pregnancy.​[^[82]] When amoxicillin has failed, amoxicillin/​clavulanate is safe to use in pregnancy. For pregnant patients exhibiting a type I IgE-mediated allergy or nonsevere type IV delayed rash to penicillin, cefuroxime is an appropriate alternative, although it is expected to be less effective against S. pneumoniae than amoxicillin. For patients who are unable to take any beta-lactams, erythromycin (nonestolate) or azithromycin are recommended, recognizing the risk of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae in many Canadian jurisdictions.​[^[14]]​[^[83]]

Fluoroquinolones should be avoided in pregnancy, as safer alternatives are usually available. Impaired cartilage development has been reported in animal studies, although there have been no reports suggesting an increased risk of major malformations, adverse effects in the fetal musculoskeletal system, spontaneous abortions, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction or postnatal disorders.​[^[84]]​[^[85]]​[^[86]]​[^[87]] Doxycycline is associated with tooth discoloration in the fetus and should not be used during pregnancy. Clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim should be avoided, particularly during the first trimester, as these are associated with increased risk for miscarriage and neural tube defects, respectively.​[^[83]]

#### Management of Rhinosinusitis while Breastfeeding

As in pregnancy, nonpharmacologic measures such as saline nasal irrigation​[^[78]] are preferred first-line measures in breastfeeding patients.

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used if an analgesic or antipyretic is necessary.

Topical decongestants such as oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and phenylephrine are considered safe in breastfeeding when used for no more than 3–5 days.​[^[88]] Topical agents are preferred over **oral** decongestants to lessen drug exposure to the newborn. If oral decongestants are needed, only short-acting forms should be used and are best taken just after breastfeeding to minimize drug levels in breast milk. Breastfeeding patients with poor or marginal milk production should be exceedingly cautious in using pseudoephedrine, as reduced milk production has been reported.​[^[88]] With topical or oral decongestant use, watch for signs of toxicity in the infant such as irritability, nervousness, insomnia or excitation.​[^[78]]​[^[88]] These products should not be used during breastfeeding of infants with hypertension or cardiac syndromes.​[^[88]]

INCS are considered safe while breastfeeding since only very small doses are used, intranasal absorption is minimal and there is rapid first-pass metabolism by the liver.​[^[88]] Therefore, it is unlikely that these products pose any risk to the breastfed infant.​[^[88]]

The American Academy of Pediatrics lists amoxicillin as compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[89]] In addition, amoxicillin/​clavulanate may be used in nursing patients. For breastfeeding patients who cannot take amoxicillin, cefuroxime or a **macrolide** can be used.​[^[90]]​[^[91]] Caution is advised with doxycycline, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin; if used, avoid repeated or prolonged exposure.​[^[88]] With any antibiotic, observe the breastfed infant for thrush, GI symptoms such as diarrhea, and rash.​[^[88]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
