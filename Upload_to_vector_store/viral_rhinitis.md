#### Introduction

Viral rhinitis, or the common cold, is typically a benign, self-limited viral infection caused by several viruses, most commonly rhinoviruses (30–50%) and coronaviruses (10–15%).​[^[1]] Infection by the virus triggers an immune reaction that releases inflammatory mediators that cause the symptoms of viral rhinitis. Typical symptoms include rhinorrhea and nasal congestion; they generally resolve untreated in 10–14 days. These symptoms may cause enough discomfort to lead to absenteeism from work or school. Adults may get 2–3 colds per year while children may get 5–7 per year.​[^[2]] There is no evidence that symptomatic treatment lessens the risk of developing complications such as middle ear effusions, otitis media, sinusitis, asthma exacerbations, or febrile seizures in infants and children.​[^[1]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are available to improve the symptoms of viral rhinitis (pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough) and the patient’s quality of life. Each pharmacologic agent employed should be directed against a specific symptom.

#### Prevention



#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Figure 1 provides an approach to the symptomatic treatment of viral rhinitis. Dosing information for the medications discussed can be found in Table 1.

#### First-Line Therapies

#### Analgesics and Antipyretics

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ASA, ibuprofen, naproxen) have not been shown to improve respiratory symptoms associated with the common cold, but may improve pain-related symptoms such as headache, ear pain, or muscle and joint pain in adults.​[^[14]]

Acetaminophen is effective at reducing fever but is unlikely to improve other symptoms related to viral rhinitis.​[^[15]]

In children, acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be helpful for treating fever and pain. Ibuprofen is generally not recommended in infants <6 months of age and naproxen is not recommended in children <12 years of age. ASA should not be used in children due to the increased incidence of Reye syndrome associated with its use during influenza virus infections.​[^[16]]

#### Anticholinergic Agents

Intranasal ipratropium blocks cholinergic-mediated vasodilatation. It is effective for rhinorrhea and relief of sneezing, but does not improve nasal congestion in adults and children 5 years of age and older.​[^[17]] Adverse effects include nasal dryness, blood-tinged mucous and epistaxis.

#### Decongestants and Antihistamines

#### Decongestants

Decongestants are used to improve nasal air flow by relieving nasal congestion and improving rhinorrhea. There may be a small positive effect on nasal congestion in adults with the common cold who take multiple doses of decongestants.​[^[18]] There is insufficient evidence to support their use in children <12 years of age. Decongestants are available in oral or intranasal dosage forms.​[^[18]]

When compared with oral decongestants, topical decongestants were found to have similar efficacy,​[^[18]] with faster symptom relief and less adverse effects. Thus, they are one of the preferred agents for viral rhinitis in adolescents and adults. Prolonged use (usually >3–5 days) of topical nasal decongestants is associated with rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa); therefore, short-term use (≤3 days) is recommended.​[^[19]] There are no published trials that evaluate topical nasal decongestants in children.

Oral pseudoephedrine is an effective treatment for nasal congestion in adults.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] Multiple doses of pseudoephedrine over a 3-day period are safe.​[^[21]] Evaluations of the effectiveness of oral phenylephrine have yielded conflicting results.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]

#### Antihistamines

Antihistamine/decongestant combinations have been shown to improve short-term nasal symptoms in adolescents and adults with viral rhinitis.​[^[24]] They may be used after topical treatments have failed.

In general, antihistamines (both sedating and nonsedating) as monotherapy do not significantly improve symptoms or recovery time.​[^[2]] The anticholinergic effects of some first-generation (sedating) antihistamines may briefly reduce nasal secretions,​[^[24]] but sedation is a common adverse effect.​[^[26]]

#### Antihistamine and/or Decongestant Use in Children

Studies examining the use of antihistamines, decongestants or antihistamine/decongestant combinations in children <6 years of age have failed to show benefit.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] In addition, accidental ingestion and dosing errors with these products can do much harm. Therefore, these agents should be avoided in children <6 years of age.​[^[30]]

There have been few trials in school-aged children (≥6 y of age). Antihistamine/decongestant combinations may be of benefit, but risks of treatment should carefully be considered.​[^[25]] 

#### Therapeutic Alternatives

#### Saline Nasal Irrigation

Nasal irrigation with **saline** (0.9 % NaCl) may offer some relief of the symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., reduced nasal secretion and congestion, reduced need for decongestants) in children and adults.​[^[31]]

Breast- or bottle-fed infants who are obligate nose breathers may benefit from regular administration of **normal saline drops**, which aid in cleaning the nose and may improve mucociliary clearance in young infants.​[^[16]]

#### Honey

Honey has demulcent effects, which may reduce cough. Its role is unclear due to conflicting evidence. Some evidence does support subjective improvements in cough frequency and severity in addition to sleep quality of children and adults.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] Much of the evidence is of insufficient size or quality to provide a clear recommendation. For patients who wish to try honey, one teaspoonful (5 mL) at bedtime is the accepted dose. Avoid honey in infants <12 months of age due to the risk of infantile botulism.

#### Zinc Lozenges

A meta-analysis of 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials in adults demonstrated that the use of zinc lozenges shortened the average duration of the common cold by just under 3 days.​[^[35]] It is difficult to make recommendations with respect to dose and duration. Zinc has an unpleasant taste and may cause nausea.

#### Therapies with Insufficient Evidence

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the following agents in the treatment of viral rhinitis:



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Fever associated with the common cold or influenza during pregnancy may be a risk factor for birth defects​[^[55]] (see Fever).

#### Management during Pregnancy

Few trials have studied the effects of viral rhinitis treatment during pregnancy. First-generation antihistamines, including brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine, are considered safe.​[^[56]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]] Due to conflicting reports of possible malformations with first-trimester use of oral decongestants (**phenylephrine**, **pseudoephedrine**),​[^[58]]​[^[59]]​[^[60]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]] more evidence is required before a clear recommendation can be made regarding their use during the first trimester.

Although data are limited and conflicting,​[^[63]]​[^[64]] oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are considered safe during pregnancy for short-term use (≤3 days).​[^[54]]​[^[65]] The extent of systemic absorption of nasally administered topical decongestants is unknown​[^[54]] and systemic side effects, such as hypertension, respiratory depression and sedation, have been reported with the use of xylometazoline nasal spray.​[^[66]] There are no published data regarding the use of **anticholinergics** during pregnancy for patients with asthma or rhinitis.​[^[67]]

The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C increases in pregnancy to 80–85 mg/day, and adequate intake is an important consideration.​[^[68]] However, a higher incidence of intrauterine growth restriction was observed in pregnant patients taking **vitamin C** (1 g) in combination with **vitamin E** (400 units) in a study designed to evaluate their role in prevention of pre-eclampsia.​[^[69]]​[^[70]] This brings into question the safety of high doses of vitamin C in pregnancy; therefore, its use is not recommended for this self-limiting condition. The safety of ***Echinacea*** use during pregnancy has not been established.​[^[71]]​[^[72]] The active component of **ginseng**, ginsenoside Rb1, was teratogenic in animal studies; therefore, caution is advised in pregnancy.​[^[73]] There are no published studies of **zinc** therapy for viral rhinitis during pregnancy.

#### Management during Breastfeeding

In the breastfeeding patient, intranasal saline and topical decongestants (oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) are preferred over decongestants.

 The use of honey is considered safe for breastfeeding patients by experts and there is no risk in passing botulism toxin to the breastfeeding child.​[^[74]]

The use of first-generation antihistamines (e.g., brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) and decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine​[^[75]]​[^[76]]) are considered generally safe in breastfeeding; however, adverse effects are possible in the infant, e.g., drowsiness, irritability. These agents, especially when used in combination, may also reduce serum prolactin in the nursing patient, thus reducing milk supply. If these agents are used, the lowest effective dose and duration should be selected. Discontinue use if a decrease in breast milk production is observed.​[^[77]]

Caution is advised with *Echinacea* and ginseng during breastfeeding due to insufficient data.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
