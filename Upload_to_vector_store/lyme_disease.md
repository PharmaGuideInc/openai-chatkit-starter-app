#### Introduction

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in North America and Europe; it is endemic in many areas of Canada​[^[1]] and the United States​[^[2]] and is reported in Europe and Asia.​[^[2]] In North America, cases are transmitted by the *Ixodes scapularis *or *Ixodes pacificus*, whereas in Europe, the responsible tick is *Ixodes ricinus*. The bacteria that causes the infection is Borrelia, a gram-negative microaerophilic mobile spirochete. Infections in North America are caused by B. burgdorferi whereas those in Europe are most often caused by B. afzelii and B. garinii.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] In 2009, this zoonosis became a notifiable disease in Canada; the number of reported cases increased substantially. From 2009 through 2021, the total reported Lyme disease cases increased from 144 to 3147.​[^[1]] This likely is an underestimation of cases, given that many cases are not reported. Surveillance data from the Public Health Agency of Canada have confirmed the spreading of blacklegged ticks in Canada (see Figure 1).​[^[3]]​[^[6]]

Wooded areas, those with tall brush or grass, or spots under leaves are the natural environments where most ticks are found because these are areas with the highest density of animals such as birds and small mammals, e.g., mice, chipmunks. A detailed review of pertinent ecology and life cycle has been published.​[^[7]] As these animal pass by, the immature and larval ticks attach to and subsequently feed on them. Adult ticks feed on white-tailed deer, which are also in rural or suburban areas.​[^[4]]​[^[8]] Ticks will feed only once during each of their 3 life cycles (larva, nymph and adult) and can acquire B. burgdorferi by feeding on infected animals.​[^[8]] Ticks can be on vegetation and attach to a new host to feed. Once on the host (e.g., mouse, deer, human), they move until they encounter some resistance; in humans, if they are on skin, they may move until they encounter an elastic, a skin fold or even a hairline. At that point, they will stop and feed, injecting blood that is infected with the spirochete. Human transmission is more likely during the nymphal stage, as nymphs are abundant and extremely small (0.15 cm, or pinhead size) and therefore less likely to be detected.​[^[2]]

The spirochete resides in the midgut of the tick where it undergoes replication; as the tick becomes engorged during a feeding, the spirochete will migrate into the tick’s salivary glands.​[^[7]]​[^[9]] Upon the start of feeding, this process takes between 36 and 72 hours, which explains why the risk of human transmission parallels the duration of tick attachment. Compared to shorter periods of attachment, there is a 20-fold increase in transmissibility when the attachment period reaches 72 hours.​[^[10]] At the site of entry into the skin, the B. burgdorferi pathogen replicates, causing the initial immune host response and resulting in a local skin manifestation. Over the subsequent days to months, hematogenous spread to various target organs may happen in the absence of treatment at the earlier stage.

The incidence of Lyme disease is highest among children 5–14 years of age with a second peak in adults 55–79 years of age;​[^[2]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]] theorized to be due to increased outdoor exposure for play and recreational pursuits. Transmission peaks during the spring and summer months when outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, hunting or working in wooded areas are more common. Since infected ticks may also be in gardens or near residential areas, absence of a specific exposure to a wooded area does not rule out potential exposure.​[^[6]]​[^[13]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

#### Clinical Presentation

The diagnosis of Lyme disease rests on the clinical evaluation.​[^[14]] An awareness of the epidemiology of Lyme disease in geographic areas is also critical when evaluating potential cases.

The diagnostic criteria does not include a witnessed tick bite, given that 30–50% of patients are unaware of having been bitten.​[^[8]]​[^[13]] There are 3 recognized stages of illness, defined by their specific manifestations and their onset in regards to the initial infection; however, there may be waxing and waning of symptoms within each stage and overlap between stages. The major manifestations are local skin lesions (erythema migrans) at the site of a tick bite as well as disseminated disease presenting with multiple skin lesions, neurological symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormalities and arthritis:



#### Prognosis of Treated Lyme Disease and Persistent Symptoms Post-Treatment

The majority of the manifestations of Lyme disease resolve over time with treatment.​[^[25]] Recovery is typically complete, with the exceptions of nerve palsies and radiculopathy for which sequelae are possible. Lyme arthritis may take several months to resolve after effective therapy, with some cases requiring consultation with a rheumatologist. Atrioventricular block from Lyme carditis also resolves, with third-degree block resolving within 1 week of treatment initiation and lesser disturbances taking up to 6 weeks.​[^[22]]

Despite effective therapy, some patients experience residual symptoms, such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, or difficulties with concentration and short-term memory.​[^[25]] In 1 study, this occurred in 10.9% of adult patients.​[^[26]] These patients are classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms since these symptoms persisted for longer than 6 months. There is no definitive evidence that these nonspecific symptoms represent ongoing infection, and prospective trials have found the frequency of symptoms is similar to that of healthy adults.​[^[6]] Additionally, prolonged antibiotic courses did not improve such symptoms.​[^[9]]​[^[27]] Currently, there is no rationale to support the decision of prolonging antimicrobial course in patients experiencing persistent nonspecific symptoms after the completion of appropriate therapy.​[^[10]] Serious adverse effects resulting in harm were seen in trials with prolonged courses of antibiotics and may preclude diagnosis of other conditions. The Canadian Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (AMMI Canada) has produced a position statement on persistent symptoms post Lyme disease.​[^[28]]

Patients should be aware that antibodies against B. burgdorferi expressed early are not protective, and reinfection has been documented.​[^[8]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

#### Laboratory Testing

For typical lesions, a clinical diagnosis is sufficient in the proper clinical context. If patients have atypical lesions, acute and convalescent testing can be performed before treatment with antibiotics. Given that false positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and even IgM immunoblot are well described in the presence of cross-reacting antibodies to other spirochetal diseases (e.g., syphilis, leptospirosis) and in viral infections (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19),​[^[31]] clinical correlation should be used to make a diagnosis of Lyme disease.

The reliability of testing at some laboratories has not been validated and therefore testing should always be done at approved laboratories in Canada. Two-tiered serological testing in Canada (see Figure 2) consists of:



Clinicians should specify the presumed exposure area on the test requisition as European Lyme disease, which is caused by a different Borrelia species (B. afzelii and B. garinii) and requires alternative serologic testing in order to be detected.​[^[2]]​[^[9]]​[^[32]]

A typical EM lesion in the appropriate epidemiologic context should always be considered a clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease regardless of serology because serological testing at this early stage has poor sensitivity (25–40%).​[^[2]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]] The sensitivity of the 2-tiered assay (see below) reaches 80–100% in patients with early disseminated, neurological or cardiac Lyme disease, and nearly 100% in late stages.​[^[2]]​[^[32]] In cases of negative testing but a high degree of suspicion for early disseminated, neurological or cardiac disease, serology can be repeated in 2–4 weeks.​[^[9]]​[^[33]]​[^[35]]

Treatment of typical Lyme disease affecting the cardiac or nervous system should precede obtaining results of serological testing results if clinically indicated. Antibodies may also persist for years, so a positive serological result cannot distinguish between active or past infection and therefore should not be used as a “test of cure” nor to monitor treatment response.​[^[10]]​[^[33]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for diagnosing Lyme disease, specifically for cases compatible with early disseminated or late Lyme disease. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The flowchart begins with a box stating: "Clinical syndrome compatible with early disseminated or late Lyme disease."

2. **Decision Point:**
   - The chart splits into two branches based on the "Duration of symptoms."

3. **Branch 1: Duration of symptoms ≤ 1 month**
   - If the duration of symptoms is 1 month or less, the recommendation is:
     - "Two-tiered serology with both IgM and IgG by IB."

4. **Branch 2: Duration of symptoms > 1 month**
   - If the duration of symptoms is more than 1 month, the recommendation is:
     - "Two-tiered serology with only IgG by IB."

5. **Key Terms:**
   - "Two-tiered serology" refers to a diagnostic approach involving two levels of testing.
   - "IgM and IgG by IB" indicates testing for both Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G using Immunoblot (IB) techniques.

This flowchart guides the diagnostic testing approach based on the duration of symptoms in patients suspected of having early disseminated or late Lyme disease.

Other laboratory tests that may be considered:



#### Co-infection

In cases of refractory Lyme disease within the proper epidemiologic context, co-infection with other *Ixodes scapularis*–borne pathogens should be suspected in patients who may have acquired the disease outside of Canada. These pathogens may include Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi, a novel *Ehrlichia muris*-like bacterium and Powassan virus.​[^[3]]

#### Prevention

In the absence of licensed human vaccine, protection against tick bites is the mainstay of prevention of Lyme disease. The Public Health Agency of Canada proposes the following strategies to minimize tick exposure:​[^[6]]



#### Tick Removal

In case of tick attachment, the following steps are recommended during removal (see Figure 3):​[^[6]]



See Infographic for a patient handout on tick prevention and removal.

![](images/lymedisease_remtictwe.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is an illustration demonstrating the proper technique for removing a tick using tweezers. It consists of two steps:

1. **Left Side:**
   - A tick is shown attached to the skin.
   - Tweezers are positioned close to the skin, grasping the tick's head or mouthparts.
   - The illustration emphasizes the importance of getting as close to the skin as possible to ensure the tick is removed completely.

2. **Right Side:**
   - The tick is being pulled upward with steady, even pressure.
   - An upward arrow indicates the direction of removal.
   - The goal is to remove the tick without twisting or jerking, which can cause the mouthparts to break off and remain in the skin.

This illustration is a guide for safely and effectively removing a tick to minimize the risk of infection or disease transmission.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Refer to Table 3 for dosing recommendations in the treatment of Lyme disease.

In addition to the PHAC website,​[^[6]] provincial, territorial or regional public health websites may have Lyme disease information specific to their respective region.​[^[38]]

#### Postexposure Prophylaxis

In the event of a documented high-risk tick bite (see criteria below), follow the algorithm listed in Figure 4.

Current guidelines recommend postexposure prophylaxis only in patients meeting *all* of the following 3 criteria:​[^[9]] 



If the above 3 criteria are met and there are no contraindications to doxycycline, a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg (or 4 mg/kg for those weighing <45 kg) can be offered if therapy is started within 72 hours of tick removal. Placebo-controlled studies have confirmed that a single dose of doxycline is effective at preventing Lyme disease.​[^[41]]

The risk of transmission from a recognized bite is only 2.5–4.6%, even in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.​[^[2]]​[^[9]] The NNT to prevent 1 case of Lyme disease is 50, but would be reduced to 11 if chemoprophylaxis was restricted to individuals whose tick was visibly engorged.​[^[2]]​[^[42]]

In children <8 years of age who are in a known endemic area and have had a high risk exposure (e.g., all 3 of the above postexposure prophylaxis criteria are met), the benefit of a single dose of doxycycline may outweigh the risk of potential side effects. Prophylactic amoxicillin for Lyme in this age group has not been studied and, due to its short half-life, is unlikely to be effective as a single dose; thus, it should not be used for this indication.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[11]]​[^[39]]

In pregnant or breastfeeding patients, prophylaxis should be based on the risk of infection versus the risk of antibiotic treatment. This will require an informed discussion with individual patients.​[^[43]] For more information, see Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.

Patient who receive postexposure prophylaxis should be counselled that prophylaxis may not prevent disease (especially if a longer time has passed since tick removal). These patients, and those who *do not* receive prophylaxis (children and adults), should monitor for signs and symptoms of Lyme disease for up to 1 month.

#### Treatment of Lyme Disease

The choice of antibiotic agent, route of administration (i.e., IV/PO) and treatment duration for Lyme disease varies according to the clinical syndrome at presentation. Updated recommendations are available from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics.​[^[9]] Of note, doxycycline is acceptable in children <8 years of age if duration is ≤ 21 days.​[^[44]]​[^[45]] 

See Table 2 for a list of first- and second-line agents. Refer to Table 3 for dosing recommendations.

If patients have meningitis or other cranial nerve involvement, empiric ceftriaxone is usually started upon admission to hospital. Once the diagnosis of Lyme disease is reasonably certain (typically lymphocytic pleocytosis) and other pathogens are ruled out, oral therapy with doxycycline can be given to complete a 14–day course. Alternatively, IV penicillin G can be used for a total of 14 days.

Patients with myocarditis, significant PR prolongation (PR >300 milliseconds), arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities should be admitted to hospital for monitoring and receive ceftriaxone initially, with transition to oral doxycycline once clinical improvement is documented. The total duration of therapy should be 14–21 days.

Patients with Lyme arthritis should initially receive a 28-day course of oral doxycycline. If Lyme arthritis fails to completely resolve or a relapse occurs, treatment with a 14- to 28–day course of IV ceftriaxone is recommended. Alternatively, if mild joint swelling is present, a second 28–day course of doxycycline is recommended.​[^[9]]​[^[39]]

Special notes:



| Indication | First Line | Duration | Second Line | Duration | Clinical Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Erythema migrans (EM) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Single or multiple EM (without neurologic, cardiac or musculoskeletal manifestations) | Doxycycline PO | 10 days | Azithromycin PO​[a] | 7 days (range: 5–10 days) | Cure rate >90% for doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. However, azithromycin has lower efficacy (80%).​[a] |
| Amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO (comparable efficacy)​[48] | 14 days |  |  |  |  |
| Lyme neuroborreliosis (neurologic manifestations) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Facial nerve palsy | Doxycycline PO | 14–21 days​[44] | Amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 14–21 days | Other than doxycycline, data to support the efficacy of oral agents is scarce.Antibiotic treatment does not affect the course of the facial palsy, but prevents late disease.​[18]No benefit of adjunctive therapy with steroids has been reported.​[49] If initial diagnosis is uncertain, steroids can be used along with an antibiotic until diagnosis of Lyme is confirmed, at which time discontinuation of steroids should be considered. |
| Meningitis, radiculoneuropathy or cranial neuropathy (including cranial nerve involvement other than 7​th) | Ceftriaxone IV or doxycycline PO​[39] | 14 days (range: 10–21 days) | Cefotaxime IV or penicillin G IV​[b] | 14–21 days | All of the listed antibiotics appear effective.The use of oral doxycycline for ≤21 days in children <8 y has been shown to be safe.​[50]Intracranial hypertension may need to be managed with medications such as acetazolamide.​[51]The use of peripherally inserted catheters for prolonged durations may increase the risk of adverse events. |
| Once other causes of meningitis have been excluded and if mildly ill or to complete initial IV therapy: doxycycline PO (200 mg once daily) | 14–21 days |  |  |  |  |
| Lyme carditis |  |  |  |  |  |
| Carditis | Outpatients (mildly ill):doxycycline PO, amoxicillin PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 14–21 days |  |  | Patients should be admitted to hospital if clinical symptoms of cardiac involvement or if PR interval is ≥300 milliseconds, as this is a risk factor for sudden death and may be an indication for a temporary pacemaker. |
| Hospitalized: ceftriaxone IV or cefotaxime IV, with step-down to doxycycline PO​[b] | 14–21 days |  |  |  |  |
| Lyme arthritis |  |  |  |  |  |
| Arthritis | Amoxicillin PO, doxycycline PO or cefuroxime axetil PO | 28 days | Penicillin G IV | 14–28 days | **NSAIDs** |
| Recurrent or refractory arthritis | Doxycycline | 28 days |  |  |  |
| Ceftriaxone IV or cefotaxime IV | 14 days (see Clinical Comments) |  |  |  |  |


#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Lyme Disease during Pregnancy or Breastfeeding

To date, there is no documented case of maternal-to-fetal transmission of B. burgdorferi.​[^[2]]​[^[11]] Detailed epidemiological investigations have failed to demonstrate an association between maternal infection during pregnancy and any adverse fetal outcomes (including prematurity or congenital malformation), whether maternal exposure occurs before conception or during pregnancy itself.​[^[43]] There is also no evidence of transmission via breastfeeding.​[^[10]] Outcomes are as favourable for pregnant patients as for other patient populations.​[^[9]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The treatment practices for Lyme disease in pregnant or breastfeeding patients follow the treatment recommendations for Lyme disease in adults in terms of duration and antimicrobial choice. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has published committee opinion on the management of tick bites and Lyme disease in pregnancy.​[^[43]]

Doxycycline was previously contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding patients due to the theoretical risk of permanent tooth discoloration and possible effect on bone formation in the fetus;​[^[8]]​[^[43]] however, to date, no such risk has been identified in pregnant​[^[43]] or breastfeeding individuals.​[^[52]] The SOGC suggests that doxycycline may be considered for *postexposure prophylaxis* if the pregnant or breastfeeding individual meets the 3 criteria listed in Postexposure Prophylaxis, after discussion of risks versus benefits with the individual.​[^[43]] Conversely, the *treatment* of Lyme disease with doxycycline is not recommended in pregnant individuals due to the availability of other agents (e.g., amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil).​[^[43]] 

Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for severe disease (e.g., neurological involvement, advanced heart block) in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, while mild/localized disease should be treated with amoxicillin or cefuroxime **axetil**. 

There is no evidence that the use of DEET or icaridin (picaridin) by pregnant or breastfeeding patients poses a health hazard to unborn babies or breastfed infants/children.​[^[43]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing a black-legged tick bite in an "at risk" area, specifically concerning Lyme disease risk in Canada. Here's a detailed description of the flowchart:

1. **Start Point:**
   - Documented black-legged tick bite in an "at risk" area.
   - Local rate of *Borrelia burgdorferi* infection in ticks is greater than 20%.
   - Refer to local public health for Lyme disease risk in specific areas in Canada.

2. **Decision Point 1:**
   - **Tick Engorged (or attached ≥36 hours):**
     - **≤72 hours since tick removal:**
       - **≥8 years of age, non-pregnant or non-breastfeeding:**
         - Administer Doxycycline PO × 1 dose.
       - **<8 years of age, pregnant, or breastfeeding:**
         - No prophylaxis; monitor for 30 days.
     - **>72 hours since tick removal; no signs or symptoms of Lyme disease:**
       - No prophylaxis; monitor for 30 days.

   - **Tick Not Engorged (attached <36 hours):**
     - No prophylaxis; monitor for 30 days.

3. **Notes:**
   - The flowchart includes footnotes (a, b, c, d) which likely provide additional context or exceptions, but these are not visible in the image.

This flowchart guides healthcare providers in deciding whether to administer prophylactic treatment following a tick bite based on the duration of tick attachment and patient characteristics.
