CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “women” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature and describes individuals who have been assigned female at birth. We are aware that this term is not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, increased tenderness, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction not attributable to other disease states. Fibromyalgia affects 2–4% of the general population and of those affected, 80–90% are women. In general, symptom onset occurs between 30 and 60 years of age. Central and peripheral system changes in terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, central sensitization, wind-up (a progressive increase in sensitivity over time, i.e., lower stimuli result in increased pain), elevated excitatory neurotransmitters, vasoconstriction, ischemia and adrenergic receptor sensitivity have been described, although none have been identified as clear causative factors.

While the etiology of fibromyalgia is not entirely clear, associations with trauma, adverse life events, impaired mood (e.g., depression), anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bladder syndrome, cold intolerance, paresthesias and coaggregation within families have been described.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Consequently, a patient-tailored approach to treatment is ideal to address both symptoms of fibromyalgia and any associated conditions.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

A systematic stepped approach starting with a thorough history, followed by physical examination and basic laboratory work is recommended for patients presenting with chronic wide spread pain. Though fibromyalgia can coexist with other conditions associated with chronic pain, it is essential that the clinician considers all possible differential diagnoses (see Table 1). 



Diagnosing fibromyalgia remains a challenge. Depending on the patient population, it can be underdiagnosed, overdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (e.g., biases may lead to an overdiagnosis in women presenting with chronic widespread pain).​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Diagnostic and classification criteria aim to decrease the uncertainty when making a diagnosis or selecting patient research participants respectively. As our understanding of fibromyalgia evolved, the classification and diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia evolved as well. The earliest (1990) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria used the tender-point examination as a tool for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.​[^[6]] In 2016, the ACR published provisional diagnostic criteria that provided a case definition for fibromyalgia based on the widespread pain index (WPI) and the symptom severity scale (SSS) (see Figure 1).​[^[7]] The Canadian Rheumatology Association and Canadian Pain Society endorsed similar diagnostic criteria to the updated ACR criteria indicating that “examination for tender points is not required to confirm the diagnosis.​[^[8]] In 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Pain Society (APS) initiated the ACTTION-APS Pain Taxonomy (AAPT) to develop a diagnostic system that would be consistent across chronic pain disorders. The AAPT, consisting of an international working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in fibromyalgia, generated a multidimensional diagnostic framework to be applied to fibromyalgia (see Table 2).​[^[9]] The AAPT does not require a tender point examination.

The 2016 ACR criteria and the 2019 AAPT criteria have comparable sensitivity and specificity,​[^[10]] and therefore either one can be used to confirm a diagnosis.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical assessment tool for diagnosing fibromyalgia, consisting of three main components: the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), and the Fibromyalgia Severity (FS) Scale, along with diagnostic criteria.

### Widespread Pain Index (WPI)
- **Purpose**: To check the number of areas where the patient has experienced pain over the last week.
- **Areas to Check**:
  - Shoulder girdle: left, right
  - Hip (buttock, trochanter): left, right
  - Upper arm: left, right
  - Upper leg: left, right
  - Lower arm: left, right
  - Lower leg: left, right
  - Jaw: left, right
  - Chest
  - Abdomen
  - Upper back
  - Lower back
  - Neck
- **Scoring**: The score ranges from 0 to 19.
- **WPI Score**: ________

### Symptom Severity Scale (SSS)
- **Purpose**: To assess the severity of symptoms over the past week.
- **Components**:
  - **A. Severity of Symptoms**:
    - Fatigue
    - Waking unrefreshed
    - Cognitive symptoms
  - **Severity Levels**:
    - 0 = no problem
    - 1 = slight or mild problems
    - 2 = moderate problems
    - 3 = severe problems
  - **Total A**: ________
- **B. Somatic Symptoms**:
  - 0 = no symptoms
  - 1 = few symptoms
  - 2 = moderate number of symptoms
  - 3 = great deal of symptoms
  - **Total B**: ________
- **SSS Score**: Total A + B, ranging from 0 to 12.
- **SSS Score**: ________

### Fibromyalgia Severity (FS) Scale
- **Calculation**: FS score = WPI + SSS
- **Range**: 0 (no symptoms) to 31 (most severe symptoms).
- **FS Score**: ________

### Criteria for Diagnosis
A patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the first three conditions are met:
1. Generalized pain in at least 4 of 5 regions.
2. Symptoms present at a similar level for at least 3 months.
3. WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5 or WPI 4–6 and SSS ≥ 9.
4. Diagnosis is valid irrespective of other diagnoses and does not exclude the presence of other illnesses.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Dimension 1: Core diagnostic criteria | Multisite pain defined as 6 or more pain sites from a total of 9 possible sites (head, left arm, right arm, chest, abdomen, upper back and spine, lower back and spine including buttocks, left leg, and right leg)Moderate to severe sleep problems OR fatigueMultisite pain plus fatigue or sleep problems must have been present for at least 3 months |
| Dimension 2: Features that may support diagnosis of fibromyalgia | TendernessDyscognition (e.g., trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, and disorganized or slow thinking) – may be assessed using self-reported questionnairesMusculoskeletal stiffness Environmental sensitivity or hypervigilance (e.g., intolerance to bright lights, loud noises and cold) |
| Dimension 3: Common comorbidities | Somatic pain conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, migraine and chronic headaches)Psychiatric conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse disorders)Sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome)Rheumatic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma)Other (e.g., joint hypermobility syndrome, rhinitis and urticaria, obesity) |
| Dimension 4: Neurobiological, psychosocial and functional consequences | General outcomes (worse quality of life, greater disability, mood and sleep disturbances when compared with controls without fibromyalgia, but an improvement and remission has also been reported)Mortality and morbidity (reports are inconsistent, maybe associated with increased frailty, slower cognition and increased risk of stroke, probably not associated with increased mortality) |
| Dimension 5: Putative neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms and risk factors | Risk factors and comorbidities (personal lifetime history of chronic pain, family history of chronic pain, early lifetime adverse events and trauma, e.g., abuse, certain types of infections such as Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease)Pathophysiology (unclear, proposed mechanisms include genetic mutations, amplification of sensory stimuli, neurotransmitter abnormalities) |


#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic management of fibromyalgia should be first-line therapy, especially due to a lack of strong data to support the use of medications. When recommending nonpharmacological therapies, health-care providers should seek out resources and facilities in their communities that promote overall health and/or focus on a physical, psychological or social issue that is germane to the patient’s health/pain issue.



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapies for the management of fibromyalgia are presented in Table 3.

Because the etiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown, drug treatments are largely empiric. Patients should receive individualized pharmacotherapy tailored to treat their symptoms. Studies have been of short duration and varying quality. 

#### Antidepressants

A wide range of antidepressants have been used in the management of fibromyalgia, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and SNRIs.​[^[31]]​[^[32]]

Low doses of amitriptyline at bedtime (e.g., starting at 5 mg and progressing slowly, every 2–3 wk, to a maximum of 50 mg) can improve sleep and reduce pain and fatigue.​[^[33]] Only short-term efficacy has been shown (≤8 wk).​[^[33]] A Cochrane review suggests that although it is an appropriate initial treatment, amitriptyline will achieve satisfactory pain relief in only a minority of patients.​[^[34]] If taken 1–2 hours before bedtime, the effect will start at bedtime, and morning hangover will be lessened.

The SNRI duloxetine does not improve fatigue, quality of life or sleep disturbances but provides a small reduction in fibromyalgia pain.​[^[35]] Duloxetine is generally well tolerated but some patients may discontinue its use due to nausea, dry mouth, constipation or headache. Duloxetine may be considered as first-line drug therapy in fibromyalgia patients with concomitant depression. Venlafaxine has not been studied in patients with fibromyalgia. However, milnacipran, an SNRI not available in Canada, was shown to be beneficial in treating fibromyalgia symptoms.​[^[36]] The levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, is marketed in Canada but is indicated only for short-term management of major depressive disorder and has not been studied for the management of fibromyalgia. 

Although SSRIs have been commonly used in the management of fibromyalgia, a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that they have a minimal effect on pain and global improvement, and no effect on sleep or fatigue.​[^[37]] SSRIs can be considered in patients with fibromyalgia and concomitant depression.​[^[33]]​[^[37]] Fluoxetine in the morning with evening amitriptyline was more effective than either agent alone in a double-blind controlled trial in fibromyalgia sufferers.​[^[38]]

#### Gabapentinoids

Evidence from a single randomized controlled trial suggests that gabapentin may improve pain scores and sleep in patients with fibromyalgia.​[^[39]] Pregabalin may be used in adults with fibromyalgia. In clinical trials, substantial pain reduction (≥50% pain intensity reduction) with pregabalin was demonstrated in about 9% more patients than with placebo (22–24% with pregabalin compared with 14% with placebo).​[^[40]] Similarly, a moderate pain reduction (≥30% pain intensity reduction) was observed in about 11% more patients than with placebo (39–43% with pregabalin compared with 28% with placebo). Pain relief with pregabalin was also accompanied by improvement in quality of life, sleep and function.​[^[41]] Pregabalin was shown to be beneficial at doses of 300–450 mg/day; doses higher than 450 mg did not produce greater symptom improvement, while lower doses (150 mg/day) were not different from placebo. Doses of pregabalin should be titrated slowly upward, beginning with 25–50 mg at bedtime, to minimize adverse effects (drowsiness, dizziness). 

#### Other Drugs

**NSAIDs** are not recommended for the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia.​[^[33]]​[^[42]] They are likely not useful because the pain is the result of central sensitization and abnormal pain signalling rather than peripheral pain or inflammation. The use of NSAIDs in patients with fibromyalgia results in increased adverse effects with no difference in pain reduction compared to placebo.​[^[42]] If considered for use in a concurrent condition, use the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time frame. 

Cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant that is structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants, is somewhat effective in fibromyalgia, particularly in improving sleep.​[^[43]]

There is no good evidence to suggest that opioid analgesics are effective for the relief of pain in fibromyalgia.​[^[44]] Additionally, several fibromyalgia guidelines recommend against the use of opioids as part of therapy.​[^[33]] Of particular concern is the risk of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, since fibromyalgia patients may already have central sensitization (hyperalgesia). Despite the lack of evidence and guidance, inappropriate and widespread use of opioids exists in this patient population. 

Although tramadol (with or without acetaminophen) has been reported to reduce pain and to improve health-related quality of life in individuals with fibromyalgia,​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]] the effect is likely due to the fact that it reduces reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine rather than to its opioid action.​[^[45]]​[^[47]] Additionally, as with other opioids, tramadol use is associated with a high risk of addiction.​[^[49]] Tramadol may therefore only be considered if alternative therapies have been ineffective or not tolerated and after careful consideration of the individual patient’s risk of dependence (e.g., history of substance abuse, see Opioids (CPhA Monograph) and Opioid-Related Disorders). 

A 2016 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of nabilone in the treatment of fibromyalgia.​[^[50]] Despite the lack of evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the management of fibromyalgia, patients may choose to try medical cannabis for symptom management. For more information, see the Canadian Rheumatology Association’s  and the College of Family Physicians of Canada’s position statements on the use of medical cannabis. 

As insomnia significantly increases symptoms severity in fibromyalgia,​[^[51]] drugs used in the management of insomnia may benefit those with severe sleep dysfunction but do not provide effective reduction of pain. Dependency and adverse effects are also concerns. Zopiclone might be useful intermittently but evidence is lacking.​[^[52]] Antidepressants with sedative properties, such as amitriptyline and trazodone, are commonly used in fibromyalgia patients to improve sleep.​[^[53]]

Treatment of peripheral pain generators by local injection (e.g., usually lidocaine 1% with or without a depot form of **corticosteroid**) to myofascial trigger points may reduce the total pain burden and the perpetuation of central pain sensitization.​[^[54]] 

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Fibromyalgia and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Before conception, patients with fibromyalgia and comorbid myofascial face pain may have reduced fertility.​[^[55]]

There is little published evidence regarding the effects of pregnancy on patients with fibromyalgia. Theoretically, elevated levels of cortisol and relaxin during pregnancy may ease symptoms in some patients. An analysis of 1178 women determined that fibromyalgia did not affect pregnancy outcomes or newborn health, but almost all patients reported worsening symptoms during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester.​[^[56]] Symptoms were worse postpartum in many patients (but eventually returned to previous levels); anxiety and depression also increased after delivery.

#### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

Nonpharmacologic approaches to pain control, stress management and energy conservation should be encouraged during pregnancy. A reminder that many fibromyalgia symptoms (generalized pain, fatigue, back pain, muscle weakness, depression and stiffness) are similar to those that also occur in healthy patients during pregnancy may help patients cope better. Adequate support is important throughout pregnancy and afterwards.

If nonpharmacologic options are insufficient to manage symptoms and drug treatment is deemed necessary, the following information may serve as a guide in making an informed decision. Acetaminophen is an appropriate analgesic for use in pregnancy. Short-term NSAID use may also be considered in the first and second trimester, if needed, for a concurrent condition; however, use in the third trimester may be of concern. Because of antiprostaglandin effects, NSAIDs can increase risks of fetal and maternal bleeding and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, and can also interfere with labour onset or duration.​[^[57]] On October 30, 2020, Health Canada started investigating the association between the use of NSAIDs in pregnant patients 20–30 weeks’ gestation and oligohydramnios due to the effects of NSAIDs on fetal kidneys.​[^[58]] This investigation is in response to a U.S. FDA recommendation to limit the use of NSAIDs during this period to the lowest effective dose and the shortest possible duration.​[^[59]] While short-term use may not pose a significant increased risk, use beyond 48 hours may require ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid. NSAIDs should be discontinued if fetal oligohydramnios is detected. Use of tramadol during pregnancy is not advised; neonatal withdrawal has been reported after long-term tramadol treatment in the pregnant parent.​[^[60]]​[^[61]]

There is limited evidence on the effects of gabapentin or pregabalin in pregnancy or during breastfeeding. A preliminary study suggests gabapentin does not increase risk of major malformations, although it may be associated with other complications including low birth weight and preterm birth.​[^[62]] Until more information is available regarding their safety in pregnancy, use of gabapentin or pregabalin during pregnancy cannot be recommended.

If there is co-existing depression with fibromyalgia, the risk/benefit ratio may favour continuing treatment with antidepressants during pregnancy (see Depression).

Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline appear relatively safe during pregnancy. The SNRIs, e.g., duloxetine, while not associated with increased risk of congenital malformations, have been associated with short-term agitation, jitteriness and poor feeding in the neonate. Newborns exposed to SSRIs in utero had an increased incidence of preterm birth, low Apgar scores, increased admission to neonatal intensive care​[^[63]] and seizures; fetal death has been reported.​[^[64]] Maternal use of fluoxetine and other SSRIs has been associated with neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension​[^[65]] and septal heart defects.​[^[66]] Neonatal withdrawal syndrome may occur.​[^[67]] 

#### Fibromyalgia and Breastfeeding

After delivery, lack of sleep and stress may aggravate fibromyalgia symptoms. Muscle pain, stiffness and fatigue may result in discomfort and interfere with the breastfeeding process. Proper positioning during feeding, feeding while lying down, use of pillows or other supports, and adequate rest periods may assist breastfeeding for the patient with fibromyalgia. Referral to a lactation consultant may be useful.

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are considered compatible with breastfeeding. Most other NSAIDs are also considered compatible but their benefit for fibromyalgia pain is limited; choose agents with shorter half-lives when possible. Small amounts of tramadol and its metabolites are transferred into breast milk, but published data of the effects on infants are lacking.​[^[68]]

Tricyclic antidepressants can cause sedation in the newborn if used in the antenatal period or during lactation. SSRIs and SNRIs are transferred into breast milk. Although some studies report no adverse effects from fluoxetine on breastfed infants,​[^[69]] poor weight gain, irritability, colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or decreased sleep have been noted in others.​[^[70]]​[^[71]] The effects of duloxetine​[^[72]] on the infant are unknown. More studies are needed to confirm safety of pregabalin during breastfeeding; however, some experts recommend continuation of pregabalin (with monitoring of the infant for drowsiness) in patients for whom pharmacotherapy is deemed necessary and use of alternative drugs with more evidence of safety is not possible.​[^[73]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
