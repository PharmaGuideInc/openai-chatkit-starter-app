#### Introduction

Dyspepsia, defined as pain or discomfort located in the upper abdomen, is one of the most common reasons patients consult their family physician.â€‹[^[1]] Other symptoms associated with dyspepsia include nausea, vomiting, fullness, early satiety and bloating. Dyspepsia is the cardinal symptom of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), which refers to the development of breaks in the mucosa of the stomach (gastric ulcers [GU]) and/or proximal duodenum (duodenal ulcers [DU]). For the purpose of this review, heartburn and regurgitation are considered symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) versus dyspepsia. GERD is addressed in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

Dyspepsia occurs in about 25% of people over the course of any year.â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]] Endoscopic findings accounting for dyspeptic symptoms will be present in approximately 25% of persons with dyspepsia. PUD is the most common cause of dyspepsia that is evident on endoscopy;â€‹[^[4]] less common findings include upper GI tract Crohn disease, celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal candidiasis and cytomegalovirus-related ulceration. Some patients with GERD will present with dyspepsia as a predominant symptom. In the absence of alarm signs and symptoms (see Investigations), the likelihood of detecting malignancy as a cause of the dyspepsia is low.â€‹[^[5]]â€‹[^[6]]

Approximately 75% of patients with chronic dyspepsia (dyspepsia lasting for at least 3 of the previous 6 months) will have a normal upper GI tract upon endoscopic examination. This group of subjects with chronic dyspepsia and normal endoscopic findings are often referred to as having nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) or functional dyspepsia (FD).â€‹[^[4]] FD can be further subdivided into 2 subtypes: epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), characterized by upper abdominal pain and discomfort not distinctly related to food intake; and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), typified by upper abdominal discomfort or fullness following a meal.â€‹[^[4]]

As the nature and severity of the symptoms do not significantly differ between persons with PUD and FD, it is not possible to reliably differentiate between these syndromes without performing endoscopy or other imaging. However, differentiation of FD from PUD is not crucial to the initial management of persons with dyspepsia in the absence of alarm signs and symptoms and may not be necessary if symptoms resolve as a result of the initial management.â€‹[^[7]]

Lifetime prevalence of PUD is about 10% in North Americans but the incidence of PUD is decreasing over time.â€‹[^[8]]â€‹[^[9]] The most common risk factors for the development of PUD are infection with Helicobacter pylori or the use of NSAIDs, including low-dose ASA. However, 5â€“20% of patients with GU/DU have no evidence of either H. pylori or NSAID use.â€‹[^[10]]

This chapter considers:



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Investigations for H. pylori infection:



#### Initial Non-Endoscopic Management of Dyspepsia

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 presents an approach to the management of dyspepsia in persons under 60 years of age in the absence of alarm signs and symptoms and Table 2 includes drugs used for dyspepsia.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

General lifestyle modification is the first approach for the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia.



#### Pharmacologic Choices



#### Dyspepsia with Normal Endoscopy

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Chronic dyspepsia with normal endoscopic findings may be referred to as functional dyspepsia. Symptomatic management of functional dyspepsia is challenging and is often unsuccessful. Reconsider diagnosis in patients with resistant symptoms.



#### Treatment of PUD due to Helicobacter pylori Infection

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Successful treatment of H. pylori (see Table 1) will result in ulcer healing and will prevent the development of recurrent PUD (in the absence of concomitant ASA or NSAID use).

#### Eradication of H. pylori

#### PPI Safety

Many patients with dyspepsia will be treated with PPIs. While these medications are usually well tolerated, the long-term use of PPIs has come under scrutiny due to the association of PPI therapy with a number of serious complications, including cardiovascular events,â€‹[^[51]]â€‹[^[52]] Clostridioides difficile and other enteric bacterial infections,â€‹[^[53]]â€‹[^[54]] community-acquired pneumonia,â€‹[^[55]]â€‹[^[56]] dementia,â€‹[^[57]] hypomagnesemia,â€‹[^[58]] kidney disease,â€‹[^[59]]â€‹[^[60]] and osteoporosis-related fracture.â€‹[^[61]]â€‹[^[62]] PPI use has also been associated with a higher rate of severe clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, though it is less clear whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition.â€‹[^[63]]â€‹[^[64]]

Associations between PPI use and any of these outcomes do not necessarily infer causality. PPI use is more likely to be directly responsible for the increase in the risk of enteric infections, including C. difficile infection. For the other reported adverse events, there is little evidence to suggest that PPI use is directly causal; rather, chronic PPI use is probably a proxy for frailty and susceptibility to disease, which may explain why PPI users are more likely to develop these adverse conditions.â€‹[^[65]]

While there is no proven causal association, PPI use should be restricted to those patients who have strong indications for ongoing use, including persons with severe erosive esophagitis, ASA/NSAID users at high risk for complicated PUD, and those with Barrett esophagus.â€‹[^[62]] All other patients should be considered for PPI deprescribing.

The practice of deprescribing refers to an effort to either discontinue PPIs outright, decrease exposure to PPIs by stepping down to a lower dose or intermittent/on-demand treatment regimen, or substituting PPIs with a less costly and/or less potent form of gastric acid inhibition.â€‹[^[62]]â€‹[^[66]] The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and Choosing Wisely Canada recommend re-evaluating PPI therapy for GI symptoms on an annual basis through a trial discontinuation or dosage reduction.â€‹[^[67]]â€‹[^[68]] See Deprescribing for information and resources to support deprescribing PPIs in appropriate patients.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Dyspepsia may appear for the first time during pregnancy but usually resolves afterwards. Some patients with dyspepsia, including those of reproductive potential, may try to manage their symptoms with nonprescription antacids, barrier agents (e.g., alginates), **H2RAs** and PPIs. These medications are generally considered safe to use during pregnancy.â€‹[^[69]]â€‹[^[70]]â€‹[^[71]]â€‹[^[72]]â€‹[^[73]]

Limited data suggest that ingestion of esomeprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole produces low levels of these drugs in breast milk and would not be expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. No information is available on the use of rabeprazole, lansoprazole or dexlansoprazole during breastfeeding. Similarly, the available information indicates that ingestion of cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine and ranitidine while breastfeeding results in infant dosages much less than those given directly to neonates; these agents would not be expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants; however, because of cimetidineâ€™s potential to cause hepatic enzyme inhibition, other drugs in this class might be preferred.

Pregnant patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia may be treated as outlined in the section Initial Non-Endoscopic Management of Dyspepsia. If a diagnostic test for H. pylori (serology, endoscopy, UBT with the â€‹[^13]C isotope) was done during pregnancy or breastfeeding, postpone treatment for the H. pylori infection until after pregnancy and breastfeeding. There is no need to test the infant for H. pylori if the breastfeeding parent is infected. It has been proposed that the â€‹[^14]C (radioactive) and the â€‹[^13]C (nonradioactive) UBTs are acceptable to use during pregnancy, since the radioactivity delivered to the fetus from the â€‹[^14]C is low and is estimated to be less than the total amount of natural radioactivity the fetus is exposed to in 1 day.â€‹[^[74]]

Exposure to NSAIDs after 30 weeksâ€™ gestation is associated with an increased risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age).â€‹[^[75]]â€‹[^[76]] If ASA, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors are absolutely indicated during pregnancy, gastroprotection with a PPI may be considered. The synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol is a potent uterine stimulant and must not be used during pregnancy.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing uninvestigated dyspepsia. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Start Point: Uninvestigated Dyspepsia**
   - **Red Flags Present** (e.g., age >60, alarm signs like vomiting, bleeding, anemia, unexplained weight loss, dysphagia)
     - **Action**: Endoscopy
   - **Red Flags Absent**
     - **Check for NSAID Use**
       - **Yes**: Discontinue NSAID or add PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor)
         - If symptoms remain after 14 days or are incompletely relieved, proceed to endoscopy.
       - **No**: Evaluate local Helicobacter pylori prevalence (>20% or unknown)
         - **Yes**: Test for H. pylori if not already performed
           - **H. pylori Present**: Treat for H. pylori
           - **Ongoing Symptoms**: Consider PPI for 4-8 weeks; if symptoms resolve, consider stopping PPI with or without initiating step-down therapy with daily Hâ‚‚RA (Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonists)
         - **No**: Start PPI for 4-8 weeks; if symptoms resolve, consider stopping PPI with or without initiating step-down therapy with daily Hâ‚‚RA
           - **Ongoing Symptoms**: Consider endoscopy and test for H. pylori
             - **Presence of Findings on Endoscopy**: Treat as appropriate
             - **Absence of Findings on Endoscopy**: Reassure patient, retreat H. pylori with second-line therapy if present, and consider use of promotility agents or neuromodulators.

This flowchart guides the clinical decision-making process for patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, considering factors like red flags, NSAID use, and H. pylori prevalence.
