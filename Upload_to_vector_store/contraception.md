CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful in addressing patient needs, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Prior to initiating contraceptive methods, certain baseline measures may be considered:



#### Therapeutic Choices

Assess the patient’s contraceptive needs. Some factors that may affect the choice of contraceptive include smoking status, age, obesity, breastfeeding and risk of nonadherence. As well, chronic medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, migraine, osteoporosis, depression, endometriosis, acne, dyslipidemia) and the use of concurrent medications (e.g., enzyme-inducing medications) may influence contraceptive choice. Effective contraception and education reduce rates of maternal and child mortality. Individual contraceptive needs change over time. Preferred contraceptive methods for younger patients are reversible, affordable and have good safety profiles and low failure rates. Many options are available such as different route of delivery, dosage, regimens and generic products. The method chosen should not interfere with other physiologic processes, e.g., vaginal lubrication, spontaneity or pleasure. After inquiring about the patient's needs and concerns, present the contraceptive choices along with appropriate counselling.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonhormonal methods of contraception are discussed in Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Hormonal contraceptive options are presented in Table 5.

#### Combined Estrogen- and Progestin-Containing Contraceptives

#### Combined Oral Contraceptives

Combined oral (estrogen- and progestin-containing) contraceptives (COCs) as well as male condoms (for STI protection) are the 2 most common methods of contraception in Canada.​[^[1]] COCs containing synthetic estrogen and progestogen (progestin) have been modified as a result of synthesis of more potent steroids. This has led to dose reduction, increased safety and reliability, and decreased adverse effects. Absolute contraindications of COCs are listed in Table 1.

Significant differences have not been shown between monophasic and triphasic COCs in regard to bleeding pattern or efficacy.​[^[4]] Fixed-dose (monophasic) COCs are easier to manipulate than triphasic COCs. Low-dose COCs with 20–25 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) are effective contraceptive agents with pregnancy rates between 0.07 and 2.1 pregnancies per 100 patient-years of treatment.​[^[5]] Ultra-low-dose COCs (e.g., Lolo) with 10 mcg EE are also available with a rate of 2.96 pregnancies per 100 patient-years of treatment for those 18–35 years of age.​[^[6]] They demonstrate reduced symptoms of bloating and breast tenderness​[^[7]]. However, low-dose COCs may be associated with more bleeding-pattern abnormalities.​[^[8]] 

Most COCs are available in 28-day cycles with 21 days of active medication and a 7-day hormone-free interval. Some 28-day regimens contain more than 21 days of active medication, e.g., Yaz, Lolo (see Table 5). For COCs with cycles >28 days, see Extended or Continuous Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives.

The progestin component of COCs varies among different products; see Table 2 for a list of COCs divided by progestin type. Products containing *third-generation progestins* (e.g., desogestrel, norgestimate) are less androgenic and may be useful in acne. While not approved by Health Canada for contraception, cyproterone **acetate** is a progestin with antiandrogenic activity that is used in combination with EE for the treatment of moderate to severe acne. However, most combined oral contraceptives (COCs) improve mild to moderate acne (see Acne).

Drospirenone is related to the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone and has both progestational and antiandrogenic activity.​[^[9]] A Cochrane review of 5 trials shows drospirenone-containing COCs may benefit patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), but there is limited evidence of benefit for milder disease or for greater than 3 cycles of use.​[^[10]] Several observational studies concluded that drospirenone-containing COCs may confer a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than COCs containing other progestins (see Risks Associated with Hormonal Contraception).​[^[11]] 

Table 2 lists the relative hormonal activity of various COC products.

Consideration must be given to potential drug interactions when selecting COCs for use. Oral contraceptives are metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 P450 enzymes, and the efficacy is reduced in patients taking concomitant enzyme-inducing drugs. Clinically significant interactions occur with the use of antiepileptic medications (e.g., carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) and the antibiotics rifabutin and rifampicin, which are known to induce hepatic enzymes. It is advisable to recommend a contraceptive method that will not be affected by enzyme inducers (e.g., depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable, copper intrauterine device, levonorgestrel intrauterine system, barrier contraception) when taking a concomitant interacting medication. See Seizures and Epilepsy, Table 3 for antiepileptic enzyme-inducing medications. Alternatively, if a patient is taking an enzyme-inducing medication short term (≤2 months), an option is to take 1 COC pill daily (at least 30 mcg EE) for 3 or 4 cycles without a break (extended regimen or “tricycling”) followed by a hormone-free interval of 4 days.​[^[12]] For patients on enzyme-inducing medications long term, the use of 2 monophasic COC pills containing at least 50 mcg EE (e.g., 20 mcg and 30 mcg COCs) with a pill-free interval of 4 days can be used.​[^[12]] Note that both regimens are off-label and long-term studies have not been conducted. Patients taking rifabutin and rifampicin should not use these alternative regimens, and alternative contraception should be recommended.

#### Contraceptive Vaginal Ring

An estrogen/progestin-releasing vaginal ring (NuvaRing) provides a more uniform contraceptive hormone concentration throughout the day,​[^[13]] thus avoiding daily hormonal fluctuations. Since both hepatic first-pass and gastrointestinal metabolism are avoided, lower doses of hormones can be used. Cycle control with contraceptive vaginal ring use is comparable to that achieved with low EE COC use,​[^[14]] with irregular bleeding in 5.5% of cycles and withdrawal bleeding in 98.5% of cycles.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] The ring can be used without interfering with intercourse. Failure rate is 0.65 per 100 patient-years.​[^[5]] A randomized controlled trial of 3 vaginal ring regimens (49, 91 or 364 days) compared with the usual 28-day cycle of ring use showed the frequency of breast tenderness, weight changes, headache and mood change were similar in all groups. Breast tenderness was more frequent with continuous use than cyclic use. Compared with 28-day regimens of ring use, a 49-day extended use regimen showed a mean decrease of 2% in bleeding/spotting days. Using it for 91 or 364 days increased the mean days of bleeding by 3.5% and 7.1% respectively; more patients discontinued therapy with the longer extended regimens.​[^[17]]

#### Transdermal Contraceptives

A transdermal estrogen/progestin patch (Evra) has similar contraceptive efficacy, cycle control and ovulation suppression to COCs,​[^[18]]​[^[19]] as well as better adherence (88% vs. 78% for COCs).​[^[20]]​[^[21]] The pregnancy rate is between 0.70 and 0.88 pregnancies per 100 patient-years of treatment.​[^[1]] For individuals weighing 90 kg or more, this method may not be effective. Obesity may also affect follicular development through various mechanisms in patients taking OCs.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]

#### Extended or Continuous Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

Use of extended cycles (with planned hormone-free intervals) or continuous use of CHCs, such as pills, rings or patches, without a hormone-free interval may provide patients with relief from severe dysmenorrhea, heavy flow or socially undesirable flow.​[^[24]] This can be achieved with products marketed for extended use (84 active tablets and 7 placebo or ultra-low estrogen tablets) or by the use of any pill, patch or ring in a continuous regimen (users take no break in between packages). Hormone-free intervals between cycles of any length should not exceed 7 days.

Compared with a 28-day cycle, extended cycles or continuous use of CHCs results in fewer bleeding days, decreased likelihood of side effects (e.g., pelvic pain, headache, bloating, swelling, tenderness) and improved symptoms of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome.​[^[24]] Extended cycles may also be associated with lower pregnancy rates.​[^[25]] One of the side effects or disadvantages of extended/continuous use is irregular, unscheduled bleeding. If an inadvertent pregnancy occurs (due to several missed pills or forgotten change of patch or ring), the patient may not realize they are pregnant without the amenorrhea that might otherwise alert a cyclic contraception user that they could be pregnant.

A 2018 large cohort study showed that low-dose continuous or extended cycle use of CHCs is associated with a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) when compared with cyclic COC use, which is unlikely to be clinically significant.​[^[26]]

#### Progestin-Only Contraceptives

#### Oral Progestin

Norethindrone inhibits cervical sperm penetration by thickening the cervical mucus. Regular and consistent use is necessary to maintain contraceptive efficacy since effect on cervical mucus decreases rapidly 22 hours after dosing. A backup method for the first month of use is recommended by the manufacturer, although some experts agree that 2 days of backup may be sufficient.​[^[27]] If a dose is missed by more than 3 hours, a backup method is required. Norethindrone can be used in patients >35 years of age who smoke, cannot tolerate estrogen, have unwanted side effects with COCs, experience migraine headache with neurologic symptoms or are breastfeeding.

A drospirenone-containing pill became available on the Canadian market in May 2022. Drospirenone acts by inhibiting ovulation. In one trial, ovulation inhibition continued despite multiple delays in dosing, suggesting that it is more reliable than norethindone-only pills, which require stringent daily timing.​[^[28]] No head-to-head trials comparing drospirenone-only and norethindrone-only pills are available. However, unlike norethindrone, drospirenone exhibits antimineralocorticoid activity and may therefore result in hyperkalemia.​[^[29]]

#### Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) given by injection produces amenorrhea in the majority of patients, but some may experience irregular bleeding and side effects such as bloating, weight gain or loss, and mood swings. It may be a viable option for patients >35 years of age who smoke and for those who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to estrogen. When DMPA is discontinued, ovulation and regular menstrual periods may not resume for up to a year after the last injection. Failure rate is <0.32% per year.​[^[30]]

A large cross-sectional study of patients (18–54 years of age) noted a 7.2% lower spinal bone mineral density (BMD) in users of DMPA than in non-users. The rate of loss was higher for those who started using DMPA before age 21 and in those using it for a longer duration (≥15 years). There is no strong evidence to support an association between DMPA and osteoporosis or fracture risk. DMPA therefore remains a recommended form of LARC.​[^[31]]

#### Etonogestrel Implant

The single rod etonogestrel (ENG) implant became available in Canada in 2020. Like other progestin-only LARCs, the implant works by continuously (over a period of 3 years) releasing a low-dose of progestin (etonogestrel), therefore inhibiting ovulation. It is highly efficacious (failure rate of 0.05%), and return to fertility is expected within a couple of weeks of implant removal. Since its use is associated with a decrease in bleeding days per month, it may be a suitable option in the management of dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis associated pain. The etonogestrel implant is safe to be inserted immediately postpartum or postabortion. 

Adverse effects include irregular bleeding and amenorrhea. Additionally, weight gain, acne, headache, breast tenderness and emotional lability have been reported. The rod is inserted subdermally at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. Complications during insertion or removal may also occur, and the rod should therefore be inserted by someone who has been adequately trained.

#### Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System

After insertion of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) into the uterus, a low dose is released continuously over a period of 5 years. It is associated with low systemic levels of levonorgestrel and is highly efficacious (≤0.2 pregnancy rate per year for levonorgestrel 52 mg over 5 years).​[^[5]] A large prospective cohort study found that while contraceptive failure was very low with use of Copper IUD or LNG-IUS, the latter was associated with a lower risk of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy.​[^[32]] Additionally, LNG-IUS can reduce menstrual blood loss, fibroid growth, dysmenorrhea and endometriosis pain. While using LNG-IUS, 20–30% of patients will stop having periods. In fibroid-related menorrhagia, menstrual bleeding was reduced by 90% with LNG-IUS compared with a 13% reduction with COCs.​[^[33]] Normal menstruation restarts within 1–3 months of IUS removal. LNG-IUS may also reduce the risk of developing precancerous cells in the uterus. A 2017 meta-analysis estimated a one-third reduction in invasive cervical cancer in patients who had used an IUD.​[^[34]]

The safety of IUDs in patients under the age of 25 was studied in a 2017 systematic review.​[^[35]] The risk of expulsion, particularly for Cu-IUD, was higher in younger patients compared with older ones. Replacement contraception must be provided if this occurs to prevent unintended pregnancy. Rates of perforation, pregnancy, infection and removals due to bleeding were found to be similar in younger and older patients.​[^[35]]

Intrauterine systems of birth control require a clinician visit for initiation and discontinuation. Although it is not indicated, misoprostol (a prostaglandin E₁ analogue) has been widely used for cervical ripening to aid in the insertion of IUDs. However, a systematic review concluded that the routine use of misoprostol is not necessary and the rate of successful insertion of an IUD is high regardless of nulliparous status or misoprostol use.​[^[36]] In nulliparous patients, pain at tenaculum placement is reduced with 1% lidocaine paracervical block compared to placebo.​[^[37]]

The most common adverse effect is occasional bleeding or spotting for the first 3 months after insertion. Treatment for LNG-IUS–related spotting with NSAIDs (e.g., naproxen 500 mg BID for the first 5–7 days of each 4‑week period), tranexamic acid (500 mg BID or TID for the first 5–7 days of each 4‑week period) or transdermal estrogen (0.1 mg continuously) has demonstrated mixed results.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] Provide reassurance to patients for unscheduled bleeding but offer alternative contraception if they are dissatisfied with the bleeding pattern after 3–6 months of use.

A very small retrospective study of 30 adolescents with congenital cardiac anomalies or major cardiovascular conditions found good efficacy and low complication rates with long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), most of which were LNG-IUS.​[^[40]]

Although an initial randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of the LNG-IUS for 5 years, subsequent studies have shown that it can effectively prevent pregnancy for 6–8 years postinsertion with a similar adverse effect profile.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] The U.S. FDA approved the use of LNG-IUS for 7 years.​[^[43]]

#### Risks Associated with Hormonal Contraception

Hormonal contraceptive use may confer an increased risk of certain conditions (e.g., MI, stroke, breast cancer). However, when used as a contraceptive method, the benefits of HCs may outweigh the risks, since pregnancy by itself is associated with significant rates of mortality and morbidity. For example, COC use is associated with a 1.5–3‑fold increased risk of VTE, while pregnancy is associated with a 6‑fold increase. Individualize HC selection based on history and considering noncontraceptive benefits, and control the individual's risk factors for disease such as obesity, smoking and hypertension. See Table 3 for a summary of risks associated with HC.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk | Evidence | Risk Management |
| Breast cancer | Evidence is conflictingRelative risk observed in a 2017 cohort study was estimated to be 1.20 (CI 1.14–1.26). The overall risk in patients taking HCs remains very low: 13 per 100 000 patient-years​[44]Risk is lower in those <35 y: 1 in 50 000 patient-years (a 20-year-old has a 0.1% chance of developing breast cancer in the next 10 y)​[44]Risk decreases with elapsed time since last use and is no longer apparent after 10 y of past use​[45]Data regarding different types of hormonal preparation and risk of breast cancer are inconsistent​[45]​[44] Moderate- and high-dose estrogen preparations as well as some triphasic formulas may be associated with increased risk compared to other products​[45] LNG-IUS users may also confer a small, increased risk​[44] | HCs are contraindicated in patients with current or past breast cancer.There is no evidence that HCs increase risk of breast cancer in those who have a family history of breast cancer or who are carriers of BRCA gene mutations.​[46]​[47] CHCs are associated with a significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk (40–50% risk reduction), both in individuals who are carriers of the BRCA1/2 mutations and in the general population of patients.​[48] |
| Cardiovascular risk |  |  |
| Ischemic stroke | Estimated relative risk 1.7 (95% CI 1.5–1.9)​[49]Absolute risk is low (19 in 100 000 patient-years),​[50] especially in the absence of CV risk factorsRisk increased with higher doses of EE but does not vary according to the type or generation of progestin​[49]​[50]Individuals who smoke and/or have migraine with aura are at increased risk | Consider alternative contraceptive methods for patients who suffer from migraines with focal neurologic signs, smoke cigarettes or are hypertensive. |
| MI | Estimated relative risk 1.6 (95% CI 1.2–2.1)​[49]Absolute risk is low (7 in 100 000 patient-years),​[50] especially in the absence of CV risk factors​[51]​[52]No difference has been found between different generations or types of progestins​[49]​[50] | Consider alternative contraceptive methods in individuals >35 y who have additional CV risk factors such as smoking, hypertension or diabetes.​[46] |
| VTE | 1.5–3-fold increased risk among current COC users compared to non-users;​[53] pregnancy is associated with a 6–10-fold increased risk​[54]Risk increases with higher EE doses and the use of third-generation progestins as well as drospirenone or cyproterone. The risk may be higher than that associated with second-generation progestins (levonorgestrel, norethisterone) and norgestimate​[55] Evidence regarding nonoral hormonal contraceptives is conflicting;​[56] vaginal ring and transdermal patch but not LNG-IUS may also be associated with a small increased riskInherited hypercoagulable states (e.g., factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency)​[46] and acquired conditions (e.g., immobility, trauma, surgery) are associated with an increased riskIndividuals with obesity are at an increased risk compared to non-users​[57]​[58]The risk of VTE with a drospirenone-only pill is unclear | Consider alternative contraceptive methods in individuals at higher risk of VTE (e.g., people with obesity).HCs are contraindicated in individuals with a history of VTE and hypercoagulable states.Current guidelines do not recommend preferential prescribing based on potential difference in VTE risk between formulations.​[59]Broad-based screening for thrombophilias (e.g., protein C or S deficiency) is not appropriate unless there’s a strong family or personal history of VTE.​[60]​[61] |
| Depression | Evidence is conflictingStudies conducted in the past 30 y examining the risk of depression with HC use found that it demonstrated no effect or a beneficial effect on moodA 2016 cohort study suggests that HC use is associated with an increased risk of subsequent first use of an antidepressant (2.2 per 100 person-years while that of non-users was 1.7 per 100 person-years); risk was highest among adolescents and users of nonoral HC​[62]A 2017 cohort study suggests that all HC use in participants 15–33 y was associated with risk of first suicide attempt and suicide (relative risk 1.97 [CI 1.85–2.1] and 3.08 [CI 1.34–7.08] respectively);​[63] risk was highest in adolescents and in the first 2 months after initiation of HCs and persisted even after discontinuation | Current eligibility criteria do not recommend against use of HCs in patients with mood disorders.Monitor for development of symptoms of depression, especially among adolescents. |

#### Management of Adverse Effects of Hormonal Contraceptives

Adverse effects associated with HCs (e.g., nausea, headache, breakthrough bleeding) often diminish with continued use (3–6 months). Nevertheless, such adverse effects may significantly affect adherence to or continuation of a contraceptive method. Table 4 summarizes the evidence regarding common patient-reported adverse effects and suggestions for management.

Proper assessment of the severity and duration of these adverse effects as well as ruling out other conditions are critical before attempting to switch to other HCs.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adverse Effect | Evidence | Management |
| Acne | DMPA, ENG–implant and progestin-only OC may be associated with acne.Patients with acne at baseline are likely to experience improvement within 6 months of COC use. | COCs are effective in treatment of acne.OCs with minimal androgenic effects and those containing the antiandrogens cyproterone acetate or drospirenone (see Table 2) are especially useful in patients with other signs of androgen excess (e.g., hirsutism). |
| Bleeding irregularities |  |  |
| Amenorrhea | LNG-IUS, DMPA, ENG-implant, continuous-use regimen COCs and continuous use of vaginal ring are associated with amenorrhea.​[64] | Pregnancy should be ruled out if amenorrhea is of new onset.​[59]Reassure patient that it is common. |
| Breakthrough bleeding | Progestin-only contraceptives and COCs with ≤20 mcg EE are associated with more breakthrough bleeding than other OC methods.​[8]Continuous-use regimens are also associated with higher rates of unscheduled bleeding.​[24] | Reassure patient that it is a common and self-resolving adverse effect that occurs within the first 3–6 months of treatment.​[65]If irregular bleeding persists or has a new onset, other causes should be ruled out (e.g., STI, particularly chlamydia; pregnancy; drug interaction; uterine or cervical pathology).​[59]COC-related breakthrough bleeding may be managed by increasing the dose to a maximum of 35 mcg EE or changing type of progestin in the COC.​[65]​[66] If breakthrough bleeding occurs with continuous regimens, the pills can be stopped for 3–4 days/cycle, then restarted.Preliminary studies indicate that progestin-only–related breakthrough bleeding may be managed with supplemental estrogen or COCs, NSAIDs or tranexamic acid. The routine use of these medications should not be recommended until further large-scale trials have been performed.​[66]​[67] |
| Breast tenderness | Transdermal HCs and continuous use of the vaginal contraceptive ring​[17] may be associated with slightly higher rates of breast tenderness, while low-dose EE formulations​[7] and continuous use of COCs​[17] are associated with decreased rates of breast tenderness.Breast tenderness associated with COC use is generally self-limiting (18 months). | Consider changing to a COC if using a transdermal HC. |
| Headache | A systematic review found that 10% of patients experience a self-limiting (first cycle) headache with use of OCs that is not affected by type or dose of progestin.​[68] | COCs are contraindicated in patients who suffer from migraine with aura because of the increased risk of stroke. Alternatively, nonestrogen contraceptive (i.e., progestin-only contraceptive or Cu-IUD) can be used.Reassure patient that headache is a self-resolving adverse effect, usually occurring within the first cycle.Extended-use regimens may reduce frequency and severity of headache.​[24] |
| Hirsutism | DMPA may be associated with hirsutism. | Consider switching to a COC.OCs with minimal androgenic effects and those containing the antiandrogens cyproterone acetate or drospirenone (see Table 2) are especially useful in patients with other signs of androgen excess (e.g., acne). |
| Sexual dysfunction | COCs with ultra-low dose EE and progestin-only OCs may be associated with decreased sexual function.​[69] Evidence regarding the effect of other HCs is inconsistent. | There is not enough evidence to recommend one HC over the other; however, if sexual dysfunction persists, consider switching to a different HC. |
| Weight gain | There is insufficient evidence to suggest an association between weight gain and HC use with the exception of DMPA and ENG-implant. | If weight gain is caused by DMPA or ENG-implant, switching to another HC may be appropriate. |

#### HIV and Contraception

Correct and consistent use of latex male condoms is the most effective way to reduce risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV. Regardless of formulation or dosage, spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 do not provide any protection against HIV.​[^[70]]​[^[71]]

Copper IUDs do not confer a greater risk of acquiring HIV than if no contraceptive method is used.​[^[70]] Although there is concern about the theoretical risk of pelvic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS who use IUDs and about transmission to uninfected partners, evidence is lacking. Another concern is related to viral shedding and interactions with the progestin IUD, but evidence supporting such concern is weak.​[^[72]] People who engage in sexual intercourse with partners who may be HIV-infected should consistently and correctly use latex condoms regardless of other contraceptive methods used.

No studies of hormone use have directly addressed whether COC use enhances disease progression in patients with HIV/AIDS. For those at high risk of contracting HIV, evidence showing any increase in that risk for COC users compared to non-users is inconsistent. For patients infected with HIV, evidence is limited but there appears to be no correlation between COC use and changes in CD4 counts or RNA levels.​[^[46]] Some antiretroviral drugs may interact with OCs (see Table 5). There is no strong evidence of association between the use of OCs or DMPA and HIV infection.​[^[73]]

#### Emergency Postcoital Contraception

See Table 6 for more information on emergency contraceptive (EC) choices. 

#### Levonorgestrel

A single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg used within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse prevents 95% of expected pregnancies.​[^[74]] Efficacy is highest if treatment is provided within 24 hours; it can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse, though the effectiveness declines with increasing delay between unprotected intercourse and treatment initiation.​[^[75]] Unprotected intercourse is defined as no contraceptive method used, condom breakage, more than 2 OC-pills missed any time during the cycle, 1 pill missed in the first week, more than 7-day pill-free interval, more than 13-week interval between DMPA injections or ejaculation on external genitalia.

The efficacy of levonorgestrel may be reduced with increased body weight or BMI.​[^[76]]In March 2014, Health Canada issued an advisory to inform patients and health-care providers that levonorgestrel ECs are less effective in individuals weighing 75–80 kg and ineffective in those weighing more than 80 kg.​[^[77]] In May 2014, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) responded to Health Canada's advisory and concluded that, until further evidence is available, patients who do not have access to or do not wish to use alternative EC methods (such as copper IUDs) should not be discouraged from using levonorgestrel-only EC, as it may still provide some benefit.​[^[78]] In July 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed an extensive review of levonorgestrel-only ECs and determined there are limited and inconclusive data on the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy of levonorgestrel.​[^[79]] The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommends that ECs containing levonorgestrel continue to be used in patients of all weights, as the benefits outweigh the risks.​[^[79]]​[^[80]] Until more evidence is available, it is reasonable to continue supporting the use of levonorgestrel for EC, irrespective of body weight.​[^[78]]​[^[79]] 

Levonorgestrel EC has a good safety record.​[^[81]] There was no diagnosis of DVT or pulmonary embolism within 45 days of the prescription in a large UK study of EC users.​[^[82]] Side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and fatigue. Emergency contraception has no effect on an established postimplantation pregnancy.

For patients taking a hepatic enzyme–inducing medication, it is preferable to take a nonhormonal EC, e.g., copper IUD. For those unable or unwilling to use the copper IUD, it is an option to take a total of 3 mg (2 × 1.5 mg tablets) levonorgestrel as a single dose as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse.​[^[12]]

Hormonal contraception can be started within 24 hours of levonorgestrel EC use. Backup contraception will be needed for the first 7 days of hormonal contraception.​[^[1]]

#### Ulipristal Acetate

Ulipristal **acetate** 30 mg was approved in Canada for prevention of pregnancy when taken within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected intercourse or known or suspected contraceptive failure. Ulipristal is a selective progesterone receptor modulator that prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor by competitive inhibition. The primary mechanism of action for EC is believed to be inhibition or delay of ovulation. 

A meta-analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of ulipristal to levonorgestrel found that ulipristal was as effective as levonorgestrel when used within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse (1.4% vs. 2.2% pregnancy rate). One of the trials also showed that ulipristal may be more effective than levonorgestrel when used 72–120 hours after unprotected intercourse (0% vs. 2.8% pregnancy rate).​[^[84]]

Data from the same meta-analysis showed the risk of pregnancy was greater in patients with a BMI ≥25 kg/m​[^2] for both ulipristal and levonorgestrel, with higher pregnancy rates observed for levonorgestrel compared with ulipristal in both patients who are overweight (2.5% vs. 1.1%) and those who are obese (5.8% vs. 2.6%).​[^[1]]​[^[76]] As with levonorgestrel, an extensive review by the EMA determined there are limited and inconclusive data on the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy of ulipristal,​[^[79]] and the EMA’s CHMP recommends that ECs containing ulipristal continue to be used in patients of all weights, as the benefits outweigh the risks.​[^[79]]​[^[80]]

Ulipristal is therefore a recommended option for EC up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse, and may be particularly favourable for individuals requiring contraception between 72 and 120 hours after intercourse or those with a BMI ≥25 kg/m​[^2].​[^[1]]​[^[76]]​[^[84]] The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were nausea, headache, dysmenorrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue and dizziness. While limited human data do not suggest a safety concern with ulipristal exposure during pregnancy, it is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected pregnancy.

Due to its high-affinity binding to the progesterone receptor, use of ulipristal may reduce the contraceptive action of progestogen-containing HC methods, and concomitant use is not recommended. Hormonal contraception can be initiated 5 days following use of ulipristal EC. Backup contraception is required for the first 5 days after taking ulipristal and for the first 7 days of hormonal contraception.​[^[1]]

#### Copper IUD

The **copper IUD** is the most effective method of EC available.​[^[1]] Postcoital insertion of a copper IUD can be considered up to 7 days after unprotected intercourse. Prior to insertion, it is important to exclude pre-existing pregnancy. A meta-analysis demonstrated a failure rate of 0.1% from more than 8400 insertions of postcoital IUDs.​[^[85]]​[^[86]] Though the exact mechanism of action is unknown, copper is postulated to impair implantation.​[^[87]] In addition to a high efficacy rate, the copper IUD is the only method to provide ongoing contraception to prevent future need for EC.​[^[88]]

#### Contraceptive Choices during Breastfeeding and Postpartum Period

After delivery, it is highly unpredictable when fertility will be restored in breastfeeding individuals. Within 6 weeks of delivery, there can be ovulation and pregnancy; these issues can be addressed at the postpartum visit. If coitus has resumed before the 6 week visit, exclude pregnancy before initiating a hormonal method of contraception. 

#### Contraceptive Choices in the Postpartum Period

Breastfeeding does not provide reliable contraceptive efficacy without a backup barrier method or alternative, as lactational amenorrhea is difficult to maintain (depends on consistent, exclusive breastfeeding, with no supplemental food or fluids given; additionally, menses must not have returned and the baby must be <6 months of age).

**Barrier methods** and **spermicide** can provide lubrication to the hypoestrogenic vagina but are not as effective for contraception as other methods.

With the exception of drospirenone-only oral contraceptive, **progestin-only** methods of contraception are recommended in postpartum individuals regardless of breastfeeding status.​[^[89]] These methods are recommended during breastfeeding due to their lower associated risk of thromboembolism in the puerperium (i.e., the first 6 weeks postpartum) compared with COCs, and their neutral effect on milk supply and establishment of breastfeeding (see Contraceptive Choices and Breastfeeding) and can be introduced immediately after delivery. Drospirenone is likely to be equally safe during breastfeeding but it is yet unclear whether it is associated with increased risk of VTE. It is therefore best avoided immediately after delivery, until more safety data are available. Norethindrone oral formulations must be taken every day at the same time, without missing a pill, to minimize spotting and maintain contraceptive efficacy. People who are breastfeeding or those with risk factors for VTE should avoid use of **COCs** in the first 6 weeks postpartum due to an increased risk of thrombosis.​[^[59]] In those who are not breastfeeding, COCs may be started 3 weeks postpartum.​[^[59]]

Although expulsion and perforation rates are higher for LNG-IUS when inserted immediately after delivery compared to 6 weeks postpartum, immediate insertion after delivery, either vaginally or via cesarean section may be considered.​[^[90]] An IUD can also be inserted immediately after a first- or second-trimester abortion. Immediate insertion appears to be safe and effective and provides convenience. As well, it provides assurance of contraception postpartum, ensures the patient is not currently pregnant, and decreases the risk of repeat unintended pregnancies and abortions.​[^[91]]​[^[92]]​[^[93]]​[^[94]]​[^[95]] Ensure good fundal placement; this can be difficult in the immediate postpartum state with the larger uterine cavity. 

#### Contraceptive Choices and Breastfeeding

Low-quality evidence suggests that progestin-only methods have no adverse breastfeeding outcomes or negative outcomes with regards to growth, health and development of infants.​[^[96]]

In addition to the increased risk of thrombotic events associated with COC use <6 weeks postpartum, COCs may have a negative effect on milk supply. Results from low-quality studies are inconsistent with regards to the effect of COC use >6 weeks postpartum on breastfeeding duration and success.​[^[97]] No negative outcomes on infants were observed with later initiation of COCs (>6 weeks postpartum).​[^[97]]

If emergency contraception is desired during the postpartum period, a single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg used within 24–72 hours of unprotected intercourse can be used with no restriction on breastfeeding.​[^[98]]​[^[99]] If ulipristal acetate is used for emergency contraception in the postpartum period, breastfeeding is not recommended for at least the first 24 hours (WHO recommends against breastfeeding for 1 week after taking ulipristal acetate).​[^[46]]​[^[93]] Breast milk should be expressed and discarded during that time.​[^[93]]

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Contraindications | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **copper-T IUD** (Flexi-T, Liberte, Mona Lisa) | Use within 7 days of unprotected intercourse as an emergency contraceptive. | Major: salpingitis, uterine perforation, cervical perforation, endometrial embedding, menorrhagia, pain, infection, ectopic pregnancy. | None. | Absolute: pregnancy, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, stenosed cervix, copper allergy, current PID or STI, cervical or endometrial cancer, inability to place or retain device.​[105]Relative: 2–28 days postpartum (to decrease risk of expulsion).​[46] | Interferes with implantation after fertilization.Can be used as ongoing method of contraception.Pregnancy test is recommended if normal menstrual bleeding does not occur by day 21 following treatment. |
| **levonorgestrel** (Plan B, Backup Plan Onestep, other generics) | 1.5 mg PO or (2 × 0.75 mg tablets taken together) as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse (most effective if taken within 72 h).0.75 mg PO Q12H × 2 doses is equally effective (second dose can be taken up to 24 h after first dose without significant change in pharmacokinetics​[83]). | Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue. | Carbamazepine, phenytoin, protease inhibitors, phenobarbital, St. John's wort, topiramate may decrease levonorgestrel serum concentrations. | Pregnancy. | Further evidence is required to support that levonorgestrel EC is less effective in patients with a high BMI. Recommend regardless of BMI.​[78]​[79] |
| **ulipristal** (ella) | 30 mg PO within 120 h of unprotected intercourse or known or suspected contraceptive failure. | Nausea, headache, dysmenorrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness. | CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort, barbiturates, carbamazepine, topiramate) may decrease serum concentrations and result in decreased efficacy.CYP3A4 inhibitors increase serum concentrations.Ulipristal binds to the progesterone receptor with high affinity and may interfere with the action of progestogen-containing medicinal products. Contraceptive action of combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogen-only contraception may be reduced. Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and emergency contraception containing levonorgestrel is not recommended. | Known or suspected pregnancy.Hypersensitivity to ulipristal or any ingredients in formulation. | Not intended for use as a routine contraceptive.Concern with efficacy of ulipristal in patients with a high BMI; until further evidence becomes available, recommend regardless of weight and BMI.​[78]​[79]It is not recommended to use ulipristal if patient has been on an enzyme-inducing medication in the past 4 wk.​[12] |
