#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 outlines the management of acute osteomyelitis.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Surgical Drainage

Antibacterials do not penetrate well into collections of pus or into bone in which blood supply is compromised by infection; therefore, a combined antimicrobial and surgical approach should be considered in all cases. Surgical decompression and exploration may be necessary when the patient is septic or clinically unstable, there has been a delay in presentation or diagnosis (i.e., to confirm microbiological etiology when causative organism may be less clear), pus has been found on aspiration, surrounding abscesses are present, or when imaging reveals evidence of bone destruction or sequestrum formation. For early disease, the role of immediate surgery has been controversial.​[^[6]] However, if swelling, pain, tenderness and fever do not improve within a few days after starting antibacterials, consider surgical exploration, especially if initial empiric therapy did not cover MRSA. Suspicion of osteomyelitis secondary to a penetrating injury (e.g., to the calcaneus) requires bone exploration, débridement and culture. Osteomyelitis associated with diabetic foot infection (see Diabetic Foot Infections) often requires surgical débridement. This should be aggressive and may involve amputation of the infected limb/digit.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antibacterials

If clinically possible, suggest delaying the start of antimicrobials until microbiological work-up has been sent, as patients are often stable; however, in pediatric patients, treatment should not be delayed beyond 48–72 hours to avoid complications.​[^[2]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]] Once cultures are pending, start empiric IV antibacterial therapy based on the most likely infecting organism (see Table 1). Generally, these infections are monomicrobial; therefore, empiric coverage should include activity against S. aureus. Some experts suggest empirically covering for MRSA if local prevalence of invasive staphylococcal infections is ≥10–20%.​[^[2]]​[^[12]] A definitive choice can be made once the organism and sensitivities are identified (see Table 2).

The role of rifampin as an adjunctive antibacterial has not been rigorously studied in the setting of uncomplicated acute osteomyelitis (i.e., nonvertebral osteomyelitis, not involving a diabetic foot infection, no associated hardware). Furthermore, rifampin should not be used alone for staphylococcal infections because resistance develops rapidly.

Subacute presentations, infections associated with prosthetic material, immunocompromised hosts, and fungal and mycobacterial etiologies warrant consultation with an infectious diseases specialist as the empiric coverage may differ significantly.

| Source | Characteristics | Usual Causative Organisms | Empiric IV Antibacterials |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hematogenous Osteomyelitis | Most common typePredominant in children and adults >50 yBloodborne bacteria lodge in bone as nidus of infection Possible in any bone but usually in long bones: femur 36%, tibia 33%, humerus 10%​[9]Vertebral osteomyelitis not uncommon in adults. Predisposing factors are IV drug use, trauma, recent bacteremia, other source of infection, e.g., urinary tract, endocarditisIn young children (<18 months), septic arthritis often coexists​[8] | Neonates: group B streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus​[10]Children: S. aureus (MSSA & MRSA​[b]), group A streptococci, Kingella kingae (children <3 y)​[8]​[9]Rare: Haemophilus influenzae,​[c] S. pneumoniae, gram-negative enteric bacteria Adults: S. aureus, gram-negative enteric bacteriaSickle cell disease: Salmonella spp. (especially in Europe, USA), S. aureus​[11] | **cefazolin** |
| Spread from Contiguous Sites​[b]​[e] | Spread from head/neck | Often polymicrobial: S. aureus, anaerobes, gram-negative organisms | All ages: IV amoxicillin/clavulanateor ceftriaxone + metronidazole |
| Spread from soft tissue infection | S. aureus, streptococciMay be polymicrobial in the setting of vascular insufficiency and diabetic foot infection | All ages: cloxacillin​[d] or cefazolin; consider IV amoxicillin/clavulanate or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole if polymicrobial; if MRSA possible, add vancomycin |  |
| Spread from genitourinary system | Often polymicrobial; gram-negative enteric bacilli, potential for necrotizing infections with anaerobesRare in children | All ages: IV amoxicillin/clavulanate.Alternative: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin) and consider adding metronidazoleAlternative: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam) |  |
| Penetrating Trauma | Example: puncture wound of foot. Does not include animal or human bite wounds. Consider discussion with infectious disease specialist | Pseudomonas aeruginosa, skin organisms (S. aureus,Streptococci)May be polymicrobial | Children: cloxacillin​[d] or cefazolin plus ceftazidime; Alternative: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam)Adults: antipseudomonal extended spectrum penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam), or cefazolin and ciprofloxacin |

#### Duration of Antibacterial Therapy

A maximum duration of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy is recommended for acute osteomyelitis without retained hardware (including vertebral osteomyelitis).​[^[15]]​[^[16]] In the setting of uncomplicated and débrided osteomyelitis, including the vast majority of pediatric cases, a 4–week duration is usually recommended.​[^[2]]​[^[15]] More severe initial presentation, extensive bone involvement, slow resolution of systemic and local signs, and infection with more resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA) may necessitate a 6-week course. In osteomyelitis following penetrating injury, 10–14 days of treatment is sufficient if adequate débridement has been performed.

Therapy can often be completed with oral antibiotics (see Sequential IV-Oral Antibacterial Therapy). However, for those requiring prolonged intravenous therapy, home IV therapy programs are an option for shortening hospital stay. Nursing resources to attend to the patient at their home, the type of home IV pumps used, or the availability of an infusion centre in a region may limit specific treatment options, especially regarding frequency of doses and stability of reconstituted antibiotics.

Shorter regimens of antibacterial therapy explored in a Finnish pediatric trial suggest a total treatment course of 20 days.​[^[17]] However, with the rise of CA-MRSA, an argument can be made that the longer, more conservative treatment courses are still appropriate in the North American setting.​[^[12]]​[^[18]]

#### Sequential IV-Oral Antibacterial Therapy

Since a long course of antibacterial therapy is required for the treatment of acute osteomyelitis, a switch from the IV to the oral route has many advantages, including reduced complications from IV cannulae and lower cost, without compromising efficacy.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]]

Numerous RCTs support the use of oral therapy in patients who are clinically stable, have adequate source control, are likely to absorb oral medications and have no psychosocial reasons that preclude the safe use of oral therapy.​[^[15]] There is no required minimum duration of IV lead-in,​[^[15]] though systemic improvement, resolution of fever, and resolution of local signs of inflammation and tenderness may take several days.​[^[25]] In the pediatric patient, laboratory markers (i.e., CRP) are also used to guide the transition from IV to oral therapy.​[^[25]] These recommendations would not apply to neonates or those with an underlying immunodeficiency.

An appropriate oral antibiotic regimen should be undertaken with the following principles:



#### Follow-Up

Success of treatment is judged clinically by careful follow-up of systemic signs (fever and well-being), local signs of decreasing inflammation and tenderness, and return of full function. ESR gradually returns to normal over several weeks; CRP may return to normal in a matter of days. In cases of vertebral osteomyelitis, it has been recommended to consider monitoring inflammatory markers after approximately 4 weeks of therapy.​[^[16]]

It is not recommended to routinely pursue follow-up imaging (i.e., MRI) for acute osteomyelitis once a patient has made an appropriate clinical recovery following adequate therapy. There is poor correlation between clinical response and MRI/CT/nuclear studies; radiologic resolution may lag.​[^[26]]
