#### Introduction

Rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory, cutaneous vascular disorder commonly diagnosed by dermatologists. Global prevalence of rosacea is estimated to be 5%, predominantly affecting those 45–60 years of age, with no difference in prevalence among the sexes.​[^[1]] 

 Rosacea is often misdiagnosed as adult acne. It is usually initially characterized by recurrent transient erythema, flushing and telangiectasia of the central face, which is visible in lightly pigmented skin but may not be visible in darkly pigmented skin or instead appear dusky to dark brown, grey, or light to dark purple. Progression to a more inflammatory condition involving persistent erythema and the presence of papules and pustules is common but not inevitable. Irreversible phymatous changes develop in a small proportion of patients, more commonly in males. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female; CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients*.)​[^[2]] More than 50% of patients with rosacea have eye involvement characterized by irritation, dryness, blepharitis and conjunctivitis, which can be present before skin symptoms are apparent.​[^[3]] See Table 1 for an approach to the diagnosis and classification of rosacea. See Table 2 for images of the various phenotypes on various skin colours.

| Phenotype | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Diagnostic Features(presence of 1 or more is diagnostic) | Persistent centrofacial erythema in a characteristic pattern (forehead, nose, cheeks, chin) that may periodically intensify due to triggers (see Table 3)Erythema presents as redness in lightly pigmented skin but may not be easily visualized in darkly pigmented skin or appear dusky to dark brown, grey, or light to dark purplePhymatous changes (including widening/spreading follicles, skin thickening or fibrosis, glandular hyperplasia, bulbous appearance of the nose) |
| Major Features(presence of 2 or more may be considered diagnostic) | Flushing—may not be easy to visualize in darkly pigmented skin but the patient may note a warm sensationPapules and pustulesTelangiectasia (small, red, spidery clusters of dilated capillaries that may be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin)Ocular manifestations strongly suggestive of rosacea: lid margin telangiectasia, interpalpebral conjunctival injection, spade-shaped infiltrates in the cornea, scleritis and sclerokeratitis |
| Secondary/Minor Features(these features may appear along with 1 or more diagnostic or major features) | Burning sensationStinging sensationEdemaDrynessOcular manifestations not specific to rosacea: “honey crust” and collarette of scale accumulation at the base of the lashes, irregularity of the lid margin, rapid tear breakup time |

The pathophysiology of rosacea has not been clearly elucidated. It is thought to involve genetics, environment, neurovascular dysregulation and increased activation of the immune system.​[^[6]] The molecular mechanism by which triggers such as *Demodex folliculorum* infestation and UV exposure may activate some of these pathways is unclear. There is increasing evidence that the presence of rosacea may be a predisposing factor or a marker for systemic disease, as associations with conditions such as migraine, inflammatory bowel disease, depression and cardiovascular disease, among others, have been reported.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Information about the nonpharmacologic management of the various phenotypes of rosacea can be found in Table 4 and Figure 1.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about the pharmacologic management of the various phenotypes of rosacea can be found in Table 4 and Figure 1. Treatment for each phenotype/feature may overlap with others and often involves a combination of therapies.

| Phenotype/Feature | Treatment Options | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All patients/all phenotypes | Avoid triggers that can worsen rosacea | See Table 3. |
|  | Regular use of a broad-spectrum, high SPF (≥30) sunscreen | See Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage. The sun and other climatic influences, such as intense cold or harsh winds, may cause an exacerbation. |
|  | General skin care for sensitive skin | Includes the use of surfactants, i.e., nonsoap cleansers and fragrance-free moisturizers, and the avoidance of astringents.​[11] |
|  | Camouflage makeup | Patients with darkly pigmented skin may require professional cosmetic support to find the correct tone of tinted foundation for their specific skin colour. Green-tinted or yellow-tinted foundation is effective for hiding the redness of rosacea in lightly pigmented skin.​[12] |
| Flushing | Possibly topical brimonidine | There is a lack of quality evidence for treatment of flushing: topical brimonidine is a possible option based on case reports and consensus statements only​[13] (see Persistent erythema below). |
| Persistent erythema (with periodic intensification with triggers) | Topical brimonidine | Topical brimonidine gel appears to be safe and effective​[14] for treatment of the general facial redness associated with rosacea, presumably acting by constricting dilated blood vessels (it has no effect on telangiectatic blood vessels). It can be considered in those for whom erythema is a cosmetic concern. Onset of effect occurs 30 min after application and can last up to 12 h. Rebound erythema is a significant concern for some patients. |
|  | Vascular laser systemsBroadband light and intense pulsed light devices | Although evidence is limited and of low quality,​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16] these methods are commonly used in practice and can significantly improve persistent erythema after 1–3 treatments. The energy from these devices is selectively targeted at the contents of the blood vessels that are causing the redness, while minimizing damage to adjacent tissues. Use caution in patients with darkly pigmented skin as hyper- or hypopigmentation may develop if these devices are used at high fluences. |
| Inflammatory papules/pustules | Topical metronidazole | Considered first-line agent.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16]​[17] Mechanism of action is thought to be by an anti-inflammatory effect achieved by reducing reactive oxygen species. In practice, treatment is often started with metronidazole, as it is generally well tolerated. Treatment duration will depend upon the severity of symptoms, but improvement can generally be expected in 4–8 wk. Counsel patients that topical treatment may need to be continued indefinitely; relapse is to be expected upon discontinuation. If response to metronidazole is inadequate, try an alternative topical therapy or combination with another topical therapy. Add oral antibiotics if the response to topical agents alone is inadequate.​[19] |
|  | Topical azelaic acid | Considered first-line agent.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16]​[17] Mechanism of action is thought to be by an anti-inflammatory effect achieved by reducing reactive oxygen species. Using moisturizer before or after azelaic acid may lessen any associated irritation. Also see metronidazole. |
|  | Topical ivermectin | Considered first-line agent.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16]​[17] Oral ivermectin is a known acaricide, and it is therefore postulated that topical ivermectin improves rosacea by decreasing the number of Demodex mites present. The exact mechanism of action in rosacea has not been elucidated but is thought to involve an immunomodulatory effect. Also see metronidazole. |
|  | Oral doxycyclineOral tetracycline | Oral antibiotics have been shown to be effective and may be added to topicals when the response is inadequate or the condition is moderate to severe.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16]​[17] The rationale for the use of antibiotics resides with their anti-inflammatory benefits, rather than their antimicrobial properties. They are generally used for up to 3 months and then reassessed. Other oral antibiotics (including minocycline, trimethoprim, erythromycin and metronidazole) do not have high-quality evidence supporting their use in rosacea and should be considered only when doxycycline or tetracycline cannot be used. Minocycline has been associated with rare but serious side effects, resulting in many experts using doxycycline or tetracycline as first-line treatments and reserving minocycline for second-line use when needed.​[19] Low-dose (subantimicrobial) doxycycline is available and appears to have similar efficacy but less gastrointestinal effects;​[13]​[14] it theoretically has less risk of antimicrobial resistance than standard-dose doxycycline.​[13] It may be an option for patients in whom gastrointestinal effects of standard-dose doxycycline are of concern. |
|  | Low-dose isotretinoin | An effective and useful option for the management of patients with treatment-resistant papules and pustules.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[16]​[17] |
| Telangiectasia | Vascular laser systemsBroadband light and intense pulsed light devices | Although evidence is limited and of low quality,​[13]​[14]​[15] these methods are commonly used in practice and can significantly improve telangiectasia after 1–3 treatments. The energy from these devices is selectively targeted at the contents of the blood vessels that are visible on the skin, while minimizing damage to adjacent tissues. Vascular lasers also target melanin to some degree and therefore caution must be exercised when using these devices in darkly pigmented skin. |
| Phyma | Oral doxycyclineOral tetracycline | May be considered in the treatment of clinically inflamed phyma based on anecdotal evidence.​[13]​[14]​[16]​[19] |
|  | Topical retinoidsOral low-dose isotretinoin | Despite a lack of evidence, some experts support the use of topical retinoids or oral low-dose isotretinoin to reduce the progression of mild to moderate phyma, as few noninvasive treatment options are available.​[16]​[19] |
|  | Laser resurfacingElectrosurgery | In clinically noninflamed phyma, treatment with physical modalities is a worthwhile option to improve the appearance of phymatous features. Risks such as postprocedural swelling and redness, possibly persisting weeks or longer, are offset by the potential for excellent outcomes.​[13]​[14]​[15]​[19] There is an increased risk of post-procedure dyschromia and scarring when these procedures are used in darkly pigmented skin. |
| Ocular | Eyelid hygieneArtificial tears | **omega-3 fatty acids** |
|  | Oral doxycyclineOral tetracycline | There is little scientific evidence available to guide treatment of moderate to severe ocular rosacea. A systematic review was not able to make any recommendations about the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis due to various etiologies including rosacea;​[23] however, some experts recommend the addition of oral antibiotics ​[13]​[19] (see Table 6); they are reported to be effective anecdotally. When symptoms subside, discontinue oral antibiotics and maintain lid hygiene and use of artificial tears. |
|  | Topical cyclosporine eye drops | Patients with persistent or severe ocular involvement should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Topical cyclosporine eye drops can then be considered.​[13]​[15]​[17] |


#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Prepregnancy Considerations

Oral isotretinoin must be stopped at least 1 month prior to becoming pregnant.​[^[24]] Small amounts of isotretinoin are found in semen; however, safety reporting has not indicated any risk of harm to a fetus due to paternal exposure to isotretinoin, and special precautions are not required. Patients who are still concerned can use condoms or postpone conception until their treatment course is completed.​[^[25]] **Tetracyclines** are cleared from the body within 1 week of discontinuation.

#### Management of Rosacea during Pregnancy

Topical therapy for rosacea is favoured. Topical azelaic acid is minimally absorbed​[^[26]] and considered safe for use in pregnancy.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] Metronidazole has demonstrated mutagenic and carcinogenic potential following systemic use in animal studies;​[^[29]] however, studies in humans have not confirmed this risk.​[^[30]] Minimal absorption occurs with *topical* metronidazole and it is considered safe for use in pregnancy.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] 

There are no human data on the safety of topical brimonidine during pregnancy. One pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that systemic levels are lower with cutaneous use than with use of the ophthalmic product,​[^[31]] for which there are a few case reports showing no harm to infants exposed during pregnancy.​[^[32]]​[^[33]] Animal studies with oral brimonidine have not shown teratogenicity or developmental harm.​[^[34]] 

Safety of topical ivermectin during pregnancy has not been established. Systemic absorption of topical ivermectin appears to be much lower than with oral ivermectin;​[^[35]] however, safety of oral ivermectin in pregnancy has not been established.​[^[36]]

Tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline are considered contraindicated as second- and third-trimester exposure can cause dental staining and enamel hypoplasia in the baby.​[^[28]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]] Inadvertent exposure during the first few weeks of pregnancy is unlikely to cause harm.​[^[37]] Tetracyclines can also temporarily inhibit fetal bone development, but the effect is rapidly reversible on discontinuation of the drug and no permanent effects have been observed.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] 

Oral isotretinoin is teratogenic. Pregnancy must be avoided 1 month before, during and 1 month after therapy. Patients with child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin must adhere to the manufacturer’s pregnancy prevention program, and close supervision by the treating physician is necessary.​[^[24]]

#### Management of Rosacea during Breastfeeding

Azelaic acid and metronidazole are both considered safe to use while breastfeeding due to limited systemic absorption and/or low transfer into breast milk.​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Care should be taken to avoid direct contact of the infant’s skin with the treated areas.

There are no human data on the safety of topical brimonidine during breastfeeding. One pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that systemic levels are lower with cutaneous use than with use of the ophthalmic product,​[^[31]] for which there are a few case reports showing no harm to nursing infants during maternal use.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

Safety of topical ivermectin during breastfeeding has not been studied. Limited data show low levels of ivermectin are transferred into breast milk after *oral* administration.​[^[43]]​[^[44]] Topical use of ivermectin should theoretically result in even lower levels in breast milk due to reduced systemic absorption and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants.​[^[45]]

Tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline are transferred into breast milk in low concentrations. Tooth discoloration and impaired bone growth could theoretically occur in breastfed infants of patients being treated with these agents. Studies have shown this to be a remote risk, as serum levels in exposed infants were found to be undetectable, and short-term use of tetracycline, doxycycline or minocycline is considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] However, as a theoretical precaution, prolonged or repeated courses (as may be the case in the treatment of rosacea) should be avoided while breastfeeding.​[^[47]] 

The safety of oral isotretinoin during breastfeeding has not been documented and it is not recommended.​[^[48]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
