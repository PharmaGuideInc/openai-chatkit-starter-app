#### Introduction

A red eye is common in a wide variety of ocular conditions and signals inflammation. The majority of these conditions are benign, and many are self-limited, but some can have serious consequences. For example, conjunctivitis can be the initial presenting sign of COVID-19, which can be potentially fatal.​[^[1]] Table 1 lists minor and major/serious causes of red eye. The presence of 1 or more warning signs (see Table 2) requires immediate referral to an ophthalmologist or an optometrist if an ophthalmologist is not available.

Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye.​[^[2]] Differentiating between the various causes of acute conjunctivitis is clinically very difficult with few tests to help. The majority of infectious (caused by viruses or bacteria) or noninfectious (due to an allergic reaction or drug toxicity) cases of conjunctivitis can be treated in primary care but certain cases require referral to a specialist (see Table 3).

| Cause | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Infection | Conjunctivitis (pink eye)Acute (e.g., bacterial, viral)Chronic (nasolacrimal duct obstruction)Keratitis (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, other [contact lens–related])Blepharitis with secondary conjunctivitis/keratitis |
| Allergy | Seasonal, keratoconjunctivitis (atopic, vernal), contact lens–related (giant papillary conjunctivitis or GPC) |
| Ocular inflammation | Iritis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, corneal infiltrate/ulcerRelated to systemic diseases (e.g., Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis) |
| Glaucoma | Acute angle-closure glaucoma (see Glaucoma) |
| Dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) | Sjögren syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)/ocular rosacea (see Rosacea), other |
| Eyelid condition | Blepharitis, hordeolum (stye), chalazion, meibomian gland dysfunction; entropion, ectropion, lagophthalmos |
| Toxic/chemical/other irritants | Ophthalmic medications, contact lens solutions, acids/alkalis, smoke, wind, UV light (e.g., tanning bed, welder's arc) |
| Traumatic injury | Corneal abrasions, foreign bodies, blunt trauma with hyphema (bleeding into the anterior chamber), heat exposure |
| Ocular manifestations of skin condition | Herpes zoster, herpes simplex (with lid, conjunctival and/or corneal involvement)Rosacea (blepharitis, dry eye; see Rosacea)Steven Johnson syndrome, psoriasis |
| Other | Subconjunctival hemorrhage, inflamed pterygium or pinguecula |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

An algorithm for assessment and management of red eye is presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The presence of 1 or more warning signs (see Table 2) requires immediate referral to an ophthalmologist. 

Thorough history to determine:



Physical examination:



|  |
| --- |
| Marked redness of the eye—limbal/ciliary injection (redness dominant at the corneoscleral junction), especially unilateral involvementWhite corneal opacity or corneal haze (with or without fluorescein staining)Moderate/severe pain with photophobia or globe tenderness—not relieved by test dose of topical anesthetic drop (proparacaine, tetracaine); possible acute angle-closure glaucoma (more common in older adults), corneal erosion/infiltrate/ulcer, iritis or scleritisReduced visual acuity—Snellen chart using a pin hole; possible iritis, corneal ulcer, glaucoma (coloured halos around lights)Pupil abnormalities (miotic or mid-dilated and fixed, irregular, sluggish to light, painful pupillary constriction) Recent trauma to eye including ocular surgery, foreign body (e.g., hammering metal on metal), chemical exposureContact lens wear (corneal infiltrate/ulcer)History of iritis/scleritis/angle-closure glaucoma—check for underlying systemic disease; history of contact lens–related ulcer, recurrent corneal erosion, chronic conjunctivitis (unilateral or bilateral) with duration >3 weeksSuspected serious infectious causes:COVID-19—conjunctivitis alone or with fever, cough and shortness of breathChlamydia—preauricular node and purulent conjunctivitis plus history of sexual contactGonococcal—hyperacute conjunctivitisHerpes simplex—usually unilateral, watery discharge and preauricular node (differential diagnosis is viral, i.e., adenovirus), eyelid vesiclesHerpes zoster—ocular involvement (usually eyelids, conjunctiva), facial vesicles, corneal complication, uveitisNeonatal conjunctivitis—usually due to Chlamydial or Gonococcal infection; may also occur due to chemical toxicity secondary to prophylactic medications instilled at birth |


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| History | Exposure to person with red eyeUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI)Exposure to a person with possible COVID-19Past history of conjunctivitis, blepharitis, styesDischarge, type and duration, purulent with morning crusting or wateryHistory of atopic allergies, atopic diseaseExposure to ophthalmic medications, chemicalsContact lens wear |
| Signs | Normal pupillary reactionDischarge and/or excessive tearingLid and conjunctival edemaConjunctival rednessDistinguishing bacterial from adenoviral conjunctivitis is clinically very difficult but a point-of-care adenoviral test, AdenoPlus, is available for health-care practitioners to use in office as a helpful diagnostic test;​[3] Viral: more common in adults; often presents as a very red eye with swollen lids, conjunctival membranes and subconjunctival hemorrhagesBacterial: more common in children and is usually associated with a purulent discharge, often from one eye;​[4]​[5] common pathogens seen in adults and children include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae; Moraxella catarrhalis may occasionally cause conjunctivitis, mainly in the pediatric population​[5] |

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a human eye. The following features are notable:

1. **Corneal Opacity**: The cornea appears cloudy or opaque, which is not typical for a healthy eye. This could indicate a condition affecting the cornea, such as a cataract or corneal edema.

2. **Iris and Pupil**: The iris is visible around the central opacity, but the details are obscured by the cloudiness of the cornea. The pupil is not clearly defined due to the opacity.

3. **Sclera and Conjunctiva**: The sclera (white part of the eye) is visible, with some blood vessels apparent, indicating mild redness or irritation.

4. **Eyelids and Lashes**: The upper and lower eyelids are partially open, with eyelashes visible. There is no apparent swelling or abnormality in the eyelids.

This image likely represents a pathological condition affecting the eye, possibly requiring further medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a human eye. Here are the details:

1. **Sclera and Conjunctiva**: The white part of the eye, known as the sclera, is visible. It appears to have prominent blood vessels, indicating possible irritation or inflammation.

2. **Iris**: The colored part of the eye, the iris, is visible. It surrounds the pupil and appears to be brown.

3. **Pupil**: The central black circular opening in the iris, known as the pupil, is clearly visible. It appears to be round and of normal size.

4. **Cornea**: The clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye is visible. There is a bright reflection on the cornea, likely from a light source used during examination.

5. **Limbal Region**: The border area between the cornea and the sclera is visible, showing a clear demarcation.

6. **Possible Pathology**: The presence of prominent blood vessels and the overall appearance might suggest conditions such as conjunctivitis or another form of ocular irritation, but a clinical diagnosis would require more information.

This image is likely taken during an ophthalmic examination to assess the health of the eye.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of an eye with several notable features:

1. **Corneal Opacity**: There is a central white or grayish opacity on the cornea, which may indicate an ulcer or infection.

2. **Conjunctival Injection**: The conjunctiva, the membrane covering the white part of the eye, appears red and inflamed, suggesting conjunctivitis or another inflammatory condition.

3. **Discharge**: There is a yellowish discharge present, which could be indicative of a bacterial infection.

4. **Eyelid and Surrounding Area**: The eyelid margins and surrounding skin appear slightly swollen and red, which may be due to irritation or infection.

This presentation is consistent with a severe eye infection, possibly a corneal ulcer, which requires immediate medical attention.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a human eye. The focus is on the sclera (the white part of the eye) and the conjunctiva (the thin membrane covering the sclera). 

Key features include:

1. **Sclera and Conjunctiva**: The sclera appears white, while the conjunctiva is visibly inflamed, showing redness and prominent blood vessels. This suggests conjunctival irritation or inflammation.

2. **Iris and Pupil**: The iris is visible with a blue hue, and the pupil is centrally located and appears round and black.

3. **Eyelid and Eyelashes**: The upper eyelid is partially retracted, and the eyelashes are visible at the edge.

4. **Inflammation**: The redness and visible blood vessels indicate possible conjunctivitis or another form of ocular irritation.

5. **Magnification Indicator**: The image includes a "1x" label, indicating the magnification level of the photograph.

This image is likely used to demonstrate signs of ocular inflammation or irritation, possibly for educational or diagnostic purposes.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Treatment of red eye depends on the history, symptom presentation and working diagnosis as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Instruct patient to:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Once major/serious conditions are ruled out, treatment can be initiated. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying cause (see Figure 2 as well as Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 and ).

Viral conjunctivitis does not usually require treatment;​[^[4]] however, cold compresses and ocular lubricants may be used.

Since most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and benign, broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops are usually not required, but may result in a modest shortening of recovery time.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Ophthalmic corticosteroids and antibiotic/corticosteroid combinations should be avoided.​[^[7]] All ophthalmic antibiotics appear to have similar efficacy.​[^[6]] Whether treated or not, if no improvement is seen after 3–5 days, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. Patients presenting with chronic, unilateral conjunctivitis should be referred to an ophthalmologist for investigation of a retained foreign body or nasolacrimal duct obstruction, which may create a reservoir for bacteria.

Reserve ophthalmic vasoconstrictors (naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, phenylephrine) for occasional and short-term use (e.g., ≤3–4 times per month and ≤3 days in a row) to provide relief of symptoms such as redness, edema (allergic or viral conjunctivitis) or minor eye irritation. Overuse of these products may cause rebound hyperemia and/or tachyphylaxis. Brimonidine, a selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist typically used for glaucoma, is available without a prescription in a lower concentration (0.025%) for the treatment of red eye. Based on limited preliminary evidence, brimonidine does not appear to cause significant rebound hyperemia or tachyphylaxis.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Algorithms

![](images/redeye_assredeye.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of a patient presenting with a red eye. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Presentation:**
   - The flowchart begins with the condition: "Patient presents with red eye."

2. **Assessment for Urgent Referral:**
   - A box lists "Warning signs for urgent referral":
     - Pain
     - Photophobia
     - Globe tenderness
     - Moderate-severe redness
     - White spot on cornea
     - Trauma
     - Contact lens wear
     - Decreased visual acuity
     - Previous eye condition
     - Pupil abnormalities

3. **Decision Point:**
   - The flowchart splits into two paths based on the presence of warning signs.

4. **Path 1 - No Warning Signs:**
   - If no warning signs are present, the flowchart directs to "See Figure 2: Management of Red Eye."

5. **Path 2 - Warning Signs Present:**
   - If warning signs are present, it suggests "Possible major/serious cause":
     - Iritis
     - Keratitis/corneal ulcer
     - Acute glaucoma
     - Scleritis
     - Trauma

6. **Referral and Treatment:**
   - The flowchart advises: "Refer to ophthalmologist."
   - If a bacterial ulcer is suspected, it suggests starting topical antibiotics.
   - It explicitly advises not to start topical NSAIDs and/or steroids.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to assessing and managing a patient with a red eye, emphasizing the importance of identifying warning signs that necessitate urgent referral to an ophthalmologist.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for assessing eye discharge and related symptoms to determine the appropriate treatment or referral. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - **Assess for warning signs requiring urgent referral (see Figure 1).**
   - If **no warning signs present**, proceed to evaluate discharge.

2. **Discharge Evaluation:**
   - **Purulent Discharge** (sticky, yellow or greenish with crusting in the morning):
     - **Corneal Involvement:**
       - **Yes:** Bacterial keratitis → Refer to ophthalmologist.
       - **No:** 
         - **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:** Consider topical antibacterials.
         - **Chlamydial Conjunctivitis:** Refer to ophthalmologist.
   - **Watery/Mucoid Discharge** (clear):
     - **Corneal Involvement:**
       - **Yes:** Viral/herpetic keratitis → Refer to ophthalmologist.
       - **No:**
         - **Itching:**
           - **Yes:** Allergy → Ocular lubricants, vasoconstrictors/decongestants, or antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers.
           - **No:** Ocular lubricants, treat ocular rosacea if suspected.

3. **Additional Symptoms:**
   - **Gritty, irritation, tearing, elderly patient ± rheumatoid arthritis:**
     - **Yes:** Dry eyes → Ocular lubricants; treat ocular rosacea if suspected.
   - **Sore throat, bilateral lymphadenopathy:**
     - **Yes:** Viral (nonherpetic) conjunctivitis → Ocular lubricants, cold compresses ± antibacterials.
   - **Burning, lid crusting, styes:**
     - **Yes:** Blepharitis → Topical antibacterials, lid hygiene; treat ocular rosacea if suspected.
   - **Nonvascular pattern (homogeneous) redness:**
     - **Yes:** Subconjunctival hemorrhage:
       - Usually resolves with no treatment.
       - If hemorrhage is extensive, interferes with proper eyelid closure, or does not resolve within 1–2 weeks → Refer to ophthalmologist.
   - **Episcleritis:**
     - **Duration >1 week:** Refer to ophthalmologist.

This flowchart guides the clinician through a series of decision points based on symptoms and discharge characteristics to determine the appropriate management or referral for eye conditions.
