#### Introduction



While the pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood, there are numerous known precipitating factors for its development. Although delirium may occur in any patient, those who are older, have sensory or pre-existing cognitive impairments, or are in postoperative, palliative or intensive care units are particularly predisposed. The more predisposing risk factors present, the fewer precipitating factors are needed to develop delirium (see Table 2 and Table 3).

Delirium should be considered a medical emergency. When recognized in a community setting, patients require immediate evaluation, which is best and most efficiently completed in a hospital setting. Timely recognition of delirium can help trigger investigation into potentially life-threatening illnesses requiring urgent treatment. Delirium has been associated with increased mortality and duration of hospital admission;​[^[2]] it may also contribute to long-term cognitive decline.​[^[3]] This chapter focuses on the prevention, treatment and management of patients presenting with symptoms of delirium.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



| Screening Tool | Clinical Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) | High specificity and sensitivity for detecting delirium; appropriate for initial screening in emergency department.​[5] CAM-ICU may be considered for patients in the ICU.​[4] |
| 4AT Method | Easy to use with good specificity and sensitivity for detecting delirium; can be completed in <3 min; appropriate for initial screening in emergency department.​[6] |
| Single Question in Delirium | The question “Do you think [name of patient] has been more confused lately?” asked of a family member has good specificity and sensitivity in oncology and emergency room patients.​[7]​[8] |
| Observational Scale of Level of Arousal (OSLA); Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) | Sensitivity and specificity of OSLA and RASS were >80% in older patients.​[7] |
| Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) Scale | 13-point screen for delirium in older patients, to be completed by a nurse and based on DSM-IV criteria for delirium.​[9]​[10] |
| Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) | 16-item clinician-rated scale that can both diagnose and measure severity of delirium; useful for monitoring progress of patient.​[9]​[11] |
| Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) | 10-item clinician-rated scale used to quantify the severity of delirium; useful for monitoring progress of patient.​[9]​[12] |


| Category​[a] | Conditions |
| --- | --- |
| Infectious | One of the most common causes of delirium in older patientsEncephalitis, meningitis, pneumonia, soft-tissue infections, syphilis, urinary tract infection |
| Withdrawal | From alcohol or benzodiazepines |
| Acute metabolic | Acidosis, alkalosis, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, hypercarbia, liver or kidney failure |
| Trauma | Heat stroke, burns, following surgery (prolonged surgeries may pose additional risk), pain |
| CNS pathology | Abscesses, hemorrhage, normal pressure hydrocephalus, seizure, stroke, tumor, vasculitis |
| Hypoxia | Anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypotension, lung or heart failure, pulmonary embolism |
| Deficiencies | Sensory impairments; deficiencies of vitamin B12, niacin, thiamine |
| Endocrinopathies | Hyper- or hypoglycemia, hyper- or hypoadrenocorticism, hyper- or hypothyroidism, hyper- or hypoparathyroidism |
| Acute vascular | Arrhythmias, hypertensive encephalopathy or shock, hypotension |
| Toxins or drugs | One of the most common causes of delirium in older patientsGeneral anesthesia, industrial poisons, medications (see Table 3), pesticides, solvents, illicit drugs |
| Heavy metals | Iron, bromium, lead, manganese, mercury |


| Offending Agent | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol | Alcohol withdrawal may also contribute to delirium (see Alcohol-Related Disorders). |
| Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine, benztropine, dicyclomine, oxybutynin, scopolamine) | Lower dose or discontinue, if possible. |
| Antidepressants (e.g., paroxetine, TCAs) | Consider replacing with SSRIs (other than paroxetine) or SNRIs. |
| Antiemetics (dimenhydrinate, prochlorperazine, promethazine) | Consider replacing with domperidone, metoclopramide or 5HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron). |
| Antihistamines (e.g., brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine) | Replace with second-generation non-sedating antihistamines. |
| Antipsychotics (especially low-potency FGAs) | Lower dose or discontinue, if possible (see Deprescribing). If necessary for agitation, use low doses of high-potency agents (see Table 4). |
| Barbiturates | Replace with alternative or discontinue, if possible (low seizure risk, no recent history of seizures). |
| Benzodiazepines and other hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) | Replace with sleep hygiene measures. If patient is a chronic user, do not suddenly discontinue, as withdrawal can contribute to delirium. Consider lowering dose (see Deprescribing). |
| Corticosteroids | Use lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. |
| H2‑receptor blockers (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine) | Replace with antacids, PPIs. |
| Muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, orphenadrine) | Lower dose or discontinue, if possible. |
| Opioids (particularly meperidine) | Replace with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, if possible. Note, uncontrolled pain can contribute to delirium; risks and benefits of opioids should be considered depending on pain severity. |

#### Prevention

Strong evidence supports multicomponent interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalized patients, which include monitoring and correction of electrolytes/glucose, hydration, regulation of bowel and bladder function, pain relief, avoidance of polypharmacy, and oxygen therapy.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] There is also evidence that monitoring depth of anesthesia can reduce occurrence of delirium after general anesthesia.​[^[4]]

The Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) is effective for reducing incidence of delirium and rate of falls in older patients.​[^[19]] HELP includes screening older patients upon hospital admission for risk factors of delirium and targeted management of these risks by an interdisciplinary team. This team may include a geriatrician, a geriatric nurse therapist, an elder-life specialist and trained volunteers.​[^[20]] 

There is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacologic agents, such as antipsychotics, for the prevention of delirium.​[^[17]] Olanzapine, risperidone, ketamine, melatonin and ramelteon (not available in Canada) may have preventative effects, but further study is required.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] 

Dexmedetomidine, a sedative typically used in the ICU, may be considered as a preventative measure for patients at high risk of delirium who also require sedation. Evidence is conflicting, and further studies are required in order to generalize its efficacy in the prevention of delirium.​[^[21]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

First, address potential causes of delirium identified on patient assessment. If symptoms persist, then patients with delirium should be managed with nonpharmacologic and behavioural methods to prevent and reduce agitation. These include frequent reorientation with the use of clocks, calendars, and pictures of family members as well as reminders by staff of the date, place and circumstances of the patient’s stay in hospital. Patients should be mobilized as early as possible, and sleep patterns should be maintained as much as possible. It is important to ensure that patients who require glasses or hearing aids have them available.

Communication of diagnosis to patient and caregivers, and encouragement of involvement of caregivers, may be helpful. Providing ongoing engagement and support with an aim to prevent complications of delirium such as falls, immobility, dehydration and isolation may also be of benefit.​[^[4]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic options discussed in this chapter are targeted toward management of agitated behaviours and not treatment of delirium. Minimizing or removing drugs that may be contributing to the development of delirium should be the first step in pharmacological management (see Table 3).

If there are ongoing concerns of risk of harm to patient, staff or other patients posed by the agitated, delirious patient and nonpharmacologic options have been exhausted, it may be necessary to use pharmacologic options. While off-label uses of antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment options (see Table 4), it should be noted that systematic reviews have shown limited benefit in reduction of severity or duration of delirium with these medications.​[^[27]] They have also been found to have no impact on length of stay in admission or associated morbidity/mortality. The goal of therapy is to ensure safety of the patient, other patients and staff by minimizing agitation. Use antipsychotics with caution, at low doses, and for as short a duration as possible, particularly in older patients and those with dementia who are at an increased risk of antipsychotic-associated stroke and death.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Small, regular doses are preferred over PRN dosing. Taper and discontinue antipsychotics upon resolution of delirium (see Deprescribing).

Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) that is the most studied medication for management of agitated delirium. When used parenterally, extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism) can be common adverse effects. Loxapine, a mid-potency FGA, and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine are also commonly used to treat agitation related to delirium.​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]] SGAs may be safer than haloperidol while being equally effective in the management of agitation.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] Oral disintegrating tablets (e.g., olanzapine) may be beneficial for patients who are not willing to swallow tablets.​[^[35]] Parenteral administration (e.g., haloperidol, loxapine, olanzapine) may be required for highly agitated or uncooperative patients who cannot or are unwilling to take oral medications. Loxapine and olanzapine have significant anticholinergic properties and may exacerbate cognitive impairment; they are not recommended for use in older patients.​[^[16]] Quetiapine also has significant anticholinergic properties, but to a lesser extent than loxapine and olanzapine.

Reserve benzodiazepines (preferably those with a longer half-life such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide) for cases of delirium where the symptoms are attributed to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal (see Alcohol-Related Disorders). For all other etiologies of delirium, benzodiazepines can contribute to the disease process and should be avoided.​[^[14]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]] Although a network meta-analysis demonstrated that the combination of haloperidol and lorazepam might be effective for the management of delirium (not-related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal),​[^[21]] further studies are required before this combination can be recommended, as the results differ from most other data.

Although there is growing evidence to support dexmedetomidine as a treatment option as it may shorten the duration of delirium,​[^[39]] the evidence is not sufficient to recommend for routine use. There may be an increased mortality risk in patients <65 years of age with a nonoperative diagnosis.​[^[40]]

The use of ketamine for the management of delirium-associated agitation is under investigation; there is currently insufficient data on this topic to make any recommendations.​[^[41]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Employ nonpharmacologic methods as first-line treatment in any patient presenting with delirium, especially those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Antipsychotics in Pregnancy

There are *no studies * assessing the use of medications for management of symptoms of delirium in pregnant patients. Use pharmacologic treatments for delirium only in situations where there is significant risk of harm to the patient, infant, staff or other patients on the treatment unit, and with informed consent. Teratogenic effects, including major congenital malformations, have not been demonstrated with the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy for the treatment of psychoses.​[^[42]] Hypertonia in neonates has been noted following prepartum use of high-potency FGAs (e.g., haloperidol). For more information on the use of antipsychotics in pregnancy and breastfeeding, see Schizophrenia and Related Psychotic Disorders.

#### Antipsychotics in Breastfeeding

Antipsychotics are generally passed into breast milk and are detectable at levels considered compatible with breastfeeding; however, data in this patient population is limited and long-term studies are needed. If antipsychotics are used, monitor the infant for adverse effects such as lethargy, drowsiness and developmental milestones (long-term use). Haloperidol at doses of 10 mg/day or less has not displayed any effect on the infant, based on limited studies. Higher doses are not recommended.​[^[43]] Loxapine is not a preferred agent in those who are breastfeeding due to a lack of available data. Of the SGAs, olanzapine is the preferred agent in breastfeeding patients based on over 100 documented cases of low infant exposure (low relative infant dose in breast milk).​[^[44]] Quetiapine also demonstrated low infant exposure, although the number of documented cases was less than olanzapine. Risperidone was associated with more infant exposure than other SGAs and may not be a preferred option.
