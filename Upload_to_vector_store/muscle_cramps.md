#### Introduction

Muscle cramps are sudden, involuntary contractions of 1 or more muscle groups that are caused by hyperexcitability of the anterior horn cells or peripheral nerves that subserve them. Cramps are painful in nature and typically occur at night. They are relieved with stretching and usually occur in the calf or foot muscles. In many cases, cramps recur multiple times and leave residual pain. Cramps increase in prevalence and frequency with age, possibly due to poor biomechanics, arthritis, vascular disease and medications.

The pathophysiology of cramps is not completely understood. Typically they have been attributed to electrolyte disturbances (e.g., dehydration, diarrhea, dialysis, diuretics). Growing evidence implicates muscle fatigue, increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory input to motor neurons from both peripheral and spinal afferents.​[^[1]] Cramps are also associated with shifts in heat/cold, hormones (thyroid, pregnancy), liver disease and certain medications. Poor posture or inefficient biomechanics may be predisposing factors.

Exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) are temporary and intense cramps that occur during or just after a period of physical activity. Several mechanisms may be involved, including muscle fatigue, disturbance of electrolyte/water balance and abnormal spinal activity.​[^[2]]

Cramps are rarely associated with neurologic disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In these cases, the cramps are accompanied by other features such as weakness and wasting of muscles. Most cramps do not need to be specifically investigated for muscle or nerve disorders, as long as they are not associated with other neurologic symptoms.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Reassure patients of the benign nature of cramps. Nonpharmacologic approaches should be the mainstay of treatment. Most cramps can be relieved acutely by static stretching of the affected muscle. For calf cramps, the patient stands 2 feet from a wall and leans forward into the wall, stretching the Achilles tendon. A hot pack or hot bath can help to relieve the cramp. Icing after exercise can be used but there are no studies to show if this is effective. 

Therapy should be aimed at preventing cramping with daily stretching exercises and use of good footwear/orthotics, which can reduce the frequency of the cramping.​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

No medication has been found to be clearly beneficial for the treatment of muscle cramps. Medications that can be used are based on low-quality evidence and studies with insufficient sample size to allow for routine recommendation; therefore, risk-benefit analysis must guide therapy for individual patients (see Table 1). A trial and error approach is frequently necessary for symptom improvement. Attempt treatment for 3–4 weeks at a therapeutic dose before discontinuing and attempting another option.

Due to the poorly understood pathophysiology of muscle cramps, multiple different classes of medications have been identified that would have theoretical benefit. Small, randomized, double-blind or crossover studies have shown potential benefit of diltiazem​[^[8]] and vitamin B complex.​[^[9]] Open-labelled trials of gabapentin​[^[10]] and verapamil​[^[11]] showed some potential benefit. Some studies have shown benefit in treating cirrhosis-associated muscle cramps with methocarbamol​[^[12]] or baclofen.​[^[13]] L-carnitine has some potential benefit based on small studies in cirrhosis-,​[^[14]] diabetes-​[^[15]] and imatinib-​[^[16]] associated cramps and may offer a favourable safety profile. **Vitamin K2 (menaquinone)** may be of benefit based on a larger study of 199 participants, although symptoms were mild in this study population.​[^[17]] Results for magnesium therapy have been mixed.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]

Quinine **sulfate** has been used off-label to manage nocturnal leg cramps in the past,​[^[21]] but its use is no longer recommended due to the high level of serious adverse effects (e.g., thrombocytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, vasculitis and cardiac arrhythmias).​[^[22]] Its proposed mechanism of action involves decreasing the responsiveness of the motor endplate to nerve stimulation and increasing the muscle refractory period.

Exercise pre- and posthydration with electrolyte replacement solution has been recommended for EAMC. Although hydration remains important, available evidence failed to demonstrate a benefit for EAMC.​[^[23]] There is evidence to support acetic acid (found in pickle juice, mustard and vinegar) for acute cramp reduction.​[^[23]] Some studies have shown a reduction in cramp duration with the consumption of pickle juice, but there was no change in monitored electrolytes. The proposed mechanism of action involves activation of receptors in the oropharyngeal region possibly reducing the firing rate of alpha motor neurons that innervate the affected muscle, rather than electrolyte replacement.​[^[2]]​[^[23]] Passive stretching/massage at the time of the cramp remains the mainstay treatment of EAMC (see Nonpharmacologic Choices).

#### Choices During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Management during Pregnancy

Nocturnal leg cramps (almost exclusively calf cramps) are common in the later stages of pregnancy, and are generally best managed with stretching. Despite inconsistent study findings, **magnesium** supplementation for 2–4 weeks is a safe treatment option to decrease the frequency of leg cramps in pregnancy.​[^[20]]​[^[24]] Vitamin B, calcium and vitamin C have also been investigated for the treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy, but evidence is insufficient to support their use.​[^[24]] Quinine, which is no longer recommended for the general population due to adverse effects, is not a safe treatment option in pregnancy.

#### Management during Breastfeeding

Muscle cramps are less common postpartum. Treatment options are similar to cramps in pregnancy and include stretching, magnesium, vitamin B or calcium. Calcium channel blockers can be used if cramps are severe.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drug Use During Pregnancy and Drug Use During Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for evaluating muscle cramps. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Decision Points:**
   - **Exercise Associated**
     - Leads to: "No further investigations needed. Consider aggravating factors: Medications (e.g., B-agonists, statins, imatinib), overly strenuous activity, poor diet, fluid depletion."
   - **Nocturnal/Infrequent**
     - Leads to: "No further investigations needed. Consider aggravating factors: Medications (e.g., B-agonists, statins, imatinib), overly strenuous activity, poor diet, fluid depletion."
   - **Multiple Muscle Groups or Frequent Cramping**
     - Leads to further investigations:
       - CBC and iron
       - GFR and creatinine
       - Electrolytes (including Mg, Ca, P)
       - HBA1C
       - TSH
       - LFTs
       - Creatine kinase (CK)

2. **Further Investigation Outcomes:**
   - **CK within Normal Limits**
     - No further action specified.
   - **High CK**
     - Action: "Repeat CK (preferably at a time with no cramping × 48 h)."
     - If "Repeat CK is high," refer to neurology and consider EMG/NCS.
   - **Correct Metabolic Abnormalities**
     - If "Persistent muscle cramps," refer to neurology and consider EMG/NCS.

3. **Neurological Symptoms Present:**
   - Symptoms include weakness, fasciculations, muscle wasting, spasticity.
   - Action: "Refer to neurology. Consider EMG, NCS or MRI series for brain, cervical or thoracic scan depending on presentation."

This flowchart guides the evaluation and management of muscle cramps based on their characteristics and associated symptoms, directing towards appropriate investigations and referrals.
