#### Introduction

Dressings are intended to protect a wound from damage and contamination, and in some cases promote healing. First and foremost, dressings help to stop bleeding and protect the wound from debris, microorganisms and further damage.​[^[1]] However, dressings may serve other purposes. An ideal dressing maintains a moist environment while removing excess exudate to prevent maceration. Wounds that are painful benefit from dressings that “soothe” nerve endings by keeping the wound moist and cool, e.g., hydrogels, hydrocolloids, sheet gels. Table 1 lists some of the common characteristics of dressings.

Wounds may be chronic or extensive. Examples of chronic wounds include peripheral vascular ulcers, pressure injuries or “bed sores,” and ulcerations secondary to conditions such as diabetes. Examples of extensive wounds may be a deep wound or one that has had tissue torn from it. All wounds, including minor or postsurgical wounds, require dressings that are specific for the type of wound.

This chapter focusses specifically on dressings. Information on other aspects of wound care can be found in Minor Cuts and Wounds and Pressure Ulcers.

| Provides mechanical protection—protection from debris and contact with clothing or other surfaces |
| Provides a moist environment—a moist environment will accelerate epidermal migration and dermal repair |
| Provides thermal insulation—a drop in temperature below 37°C delays mitotic activity for up to 4 h |
| Is highly absorptive—excess exudate can macerate healthy tissue |
| Is impermeable to bacteria—bacteria and other microorganisms can colonize a wound |
| Is free of contaminants—sterile technique is paramount in the application of sterile dressings |
| Is nonadherent—dressings that adhere to wounds can cause further tissue damage |
| Is nontoxic—some antiseptics and hypochlorites are toxic to tissue |
| Is comfortable and suitable for the wound—size and location of wound, acceptability to patient, and cost effectiveness must all be considered |


#### Dressing Types

#### Gauze

Gauze acts as an absorbent and a protectant. It is made by weaving bleached cotton into an open-mesh cloth. Natural waxes and impurities are removed from the cotton to increase its absorbing capacity. Gauze is classified either according to its mesh or to the number of threads per inch. Self-adherent gauze clings to itself; available as pads or rolls, it can be used to wrap a wound without adhesive tape, e.g., head wound. Viscous rayon and regenerated cellulose are also used in bandages, sometimes in conjunction with gauze.

Nonadherent gauze is easily removable, yet still protective. It is preferred as the primary dressing next to the wound because of increased comfort. When removed, nonadherent gauze does not leave gauze threads on the wound surface, nor does it disturb the wound surface by “pulling” or removing any of the surface. It is prepared by impregnating viscous rayon with an oil-in-water emulsion or by covering the gauze with a perforated plastic film.

#### Adhesive Tape

Adhesive tape is used to secure a gauze dressing to a wound. Several kinds are available in a variety of widths, including waterproof, cloth, clear and paper. The choice of tape depends upon the size and type of wound, potential skin sensitivities and personal preference. In general, hypoallergenic and easy-to-remove adhesive tapes are preferred. For maximal adhesion, apply tape to dry skin. For wounds that require protection from water or even dirt, waterproof tape is preferred. Paper or cloth tape reduces the risk of skin damage for wounds that require frequent dressing changes.

Adhesive tape is a fabric or film evenly coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive mixture. Today, most adhesives are acrylate-based; historically, they were rubber-based. Acrylate-based adhesives tend to produce fewer allergic reactions, and thus are generally termed hypoallergenic. While some reports estimate adhesive tape allergies occur in 0.3% of patients, true allergic reactions represent a small fraction of reactions to adhesive tape.​[^[2]] Rather, the irritation may be considered a nonallergic tape reaction caused by factors such as the mechanics of tape removal (repeated removal or skin stripping, removal from a hair-covered area of skin). Combined with an existing dermatitis or a fragile skin surface, adhesive tape reactions may be severe.

#### Bandages

Bandages are most commonly a combination of gauze and adhesive tape. They may be self-adhesive or require further adhesive material. Self-adhesive bandages are convenient alternatives to gauze and tape and include those with adhesive borders on all sides; however, the correct size needs to be chosen for the wound. The bandage should be large enough to cover the wound completely, yet not too large. If the bandage is too small, the adhesive may adhere to the wound, making removal difficult, or alternatively, a portion of the wound will be exposed. If the bandage is too large, the wound will not be covered securely, impairing healing; the bandage itself may “bunch” and come loose from the wound. For wounds on body areas that are difficult to bandage, such as fingertips and knuckles, specially shaped bandages are available. Butterfly closures are self-adhesive bandages that pull and hold the edges of small wounds together to encourage healing. Butterfly closures are not a substitute for stitches in larger wounds.

#### Protective Dressings

Protective dressings are either mechanical or physical or a combination of both. Compared with physical dressings, which simply provide a physical barrier, mechanical dressings perform other functions. Some act as tissue adhesives, absorbents for exudate and wound débridement agents. Most require a secondary dressing of gauze and adhesive tape to secure them. Table 2 lists suitable dressings based on the wound to be treated. Protective dressings include the following types:



#### Medicated Dressings

Gauze or some types of protective dressings, as previously discussed, may be impregnated with various agents to achieve therapeutic effects.

Petrolatum gauze is easily removed and acts as a protectant for the underlying skin; dressings containing water or saline aid in débridement (the removal of foreign material as well as dead tissue) and prevent dehydration.

There is no robust evidence for the use of antiseptic- or antibiotic-impregnated dressings in the prevention and treatment of wound infections​[^[4]] and they are not a substitute for appropriate and effective wound cleansing and débridement. Additionally, systemic absorption may complicate the use of antiseptics or antibiotics on wounds covering large areas, e.g., burns. Despite the lack of evidence, in practice, antiseptic- or antibiotic-impregnated dressings containing chlorhexidine, povidone/​iodine, framycetin sulfate or silver among others may be used in an effort to prevent or treat infection and ease removal of the dressing. Iodine-containing dressings should be used with caution in patients with thyroid disorders or renal disease and in pregnant or breastfeeding patients or infants less than 6 months of age.​[^[1]]​[^[5]] Patients with wounds showing signs of clinical infection (e.g., pus, pain, warmth, swelling) must be assessed by a health-care provider, as use of a medicated dressing may delay appropriate treatment; systemic antibiotics may be required.​[^[1]]

Medical grade honey has antibacterial activity that may be related to its low pH, osmotic effects, and the presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal substances. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may contribute to its wound-healing effects.​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]] There is evidence that topical honey speeds healing of different types of wounds including burns and infected surgical wounds.​[^[9]]​[^[10]]

#### Choice of Dressing

The choice of dressing depends upon the characteristics of the wound, patient characteristics and cost. Primary factors are wound etiology, classification, size and shape, and the amount and type of healing that has occurred. The appearance of the wound edges and surrounding skin influence the dressing size and adhesive choice. The presence of an exudate or infection must also be considered.

The presence of exudate is a barrier to healing because it inhibits cell growth, contributes to bacterial imbalance, increases necrotic tissue development and reduces the migration of key cells needed for healing, e.g., keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Compression therapy, mechanical devices such as some débridement materials, and absorptive dressings are used to reduce exudate.

The potential need for débridement can affect the choice of dressing. An occlusive dressing maintains a moist environment that results in autolytic or self-débridement. Wet-to-dry dressings and irrigation will mechanically débride a wound, but may remove healthy as well as dead tissue. Due to risk of skin sensitivity and the availability of more effective methods, chemical or enzyme débridement is now reserved for specific, problematic wounds. Physical débridement (using clean tweezers to remove debris) is an important step in preparing a wound for dressing application. Prepared dressings that contain maggots to débride the wound are available. The dressing confines the maggots to the wound while allowing them to breathe and enable wound drainage.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] See Pressure Ulcers for more information on débridement.

Patient comfort and preference as well as the anatomical location of the wound will affect the choice of dressing. Factors such as the patient’s circulation and nutritional and medical status are considerations, as are the availability and durability of the dressing itself.

| Granulating surface requiring creation of moist environment and management of exudate | Alginate dressings | Algisite, Kaltostat |
| Foam dressings | Allevyn, Aquacel Foam, Biatain Foam |  |
| Film dressings | Opsite |  |
| Hydrocolloid dressings | Duoderm CGF, Comfeel Plus, Tegaderm |  |
| Hydrofiber dressings | Aquacel, Durafiber |  |
| Epithelializing surface requiring creation of moist environment | Film dressings | Opsite |
| Foam dressings | Allevyn, Aquacel Foam, Biatain Foam |  |
| Thin hydrocolloid dressings | DuoDerm Extra Thin, Comfeel Plus Transparent, Tegaderm Thin |  |
| Hydrofiber dressings | Aquacel, Durafiber |  |
| Painful wounds requiring a dressing that protects nerve endings | Hydrogels, hydrocolloids and sheet gels are good choices | Aqua-Flo, Duoderm CGF, Comfeel Plus, Intrasite Gel, Tegaderm |
| Hydrophilic dressings such as sugar paste or cadexomer iodine exert an osmotic pull and may increase the pain |  |  |
| Odour, most often caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas | Silver sulfadiazine and framycetin reduce colonization. Povidone/iodine has antiseptic activity, but is quickly deactivated in the presence of pus; therefore, an iodine cadexomer dressing may be preferred since it allows for a slower release of antiseptic, extending the antiseptic activity | Flamazine, Sofra-tulle, Iodosorb |
| Excessive exudate requiring a balance between the need for a moist environment and prevention of maceration | Foam and hydrocolloid dressings are good choices to absorb exudate. Some types of wounds (e.g., venous ulcers) and wounds in some types of medical conditions, e.g., hypertension coupled with venous disease, produce more exudate. In these situations, compression bandages may also be useful to help reduce exudate by decreasing venous pressure and controlling edema | Allevyn, Duoderm CGF, Comfeel Plus, Tegaderm |
| Bleeding that needs to be controlled | Alginates have hemostatic properties | Algisite, Kaltostat |
| Infection that may need to be controlled by systemic antibiotic treatment | Antiseptic- or antibiotic-impregnated gauze may be useful | Actilite, Bactigras, Sofra-tulle |
| Fragile skin or skin tears | Silicone-based dressings, which do not stick to moist surfaces (wounds), cause less epidermal trauma and pain upon removal, and do not leave residue on the skin | Biatain Silicone, Mepilex Border Lite, Tegaderm Silicone |


#### Potential Problems when Applying a Dressing

The most commonly used dressings are self-adhesive bandages. Their application is straightforward; however, care must be taken to ensure the gauze pad is not contaminated through handling. Proper use and application of any dressing are essential for maximum effectiveness.

Principles of optimal use of dressings:



|  |
| --- |
| Wash hands and work in a clean area—wearing gloves is an option; the working surface (e.g., table or countertop) may need to be cleaned with a disinfectant. |
| Assess wound—if the wound is deep or bleeding excessively, or is the result of a puncture, seek medical attention. |
| Control bleeding—allow the wound to bleed slightly, then apply gentle pressure to stop the bleeding. Do not apply pressure to a puncture wound to avoid pushing the puncturing object further into the wound. |
| Clean wound—remove large foreign particles, débride if necessary by flushing with clean water, and wash with soap and water. |
| Check for symptoms of infection—watch for swelling, heat, pain, pus, colour changes (redness in lightly pigmented skin or grey/purple/brown/black in darkly pigmented skin), and if present, seek medical attention. |
| Apply dressing—cover the wound with a dry, sterile gauze dressing using commercially available materials whenever possible; ensure the dressing extends beyond the edges of the wound; use adhesive tape to secure the dressing and do not impede circulation by bandaging the wound too tightly. Ensure that the dressing fits well, doesn’t bunch, and is snug enough to prevent it from falling off. |
