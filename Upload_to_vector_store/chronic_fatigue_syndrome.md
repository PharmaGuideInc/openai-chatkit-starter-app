#### Introduction

Fatigue, usually short-lived, is a very common complaint in primary care and is often related to some identifiable cause. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), previously referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome,​[^[1]] is characterized by a different degree and type of fatigue. This fatigue is prolonged, unexplained, causes severe impairment in daily function and is distinguished by postexertional malaise (PEM): a worsening of symptoms following even minor exertion, often described by patients as “crashes.” ME/CFS is a chronic multisystem disease that is often life altering. Some 20–30% of ME/CFS cases are severe enough for the person to be homebound or bedbound.​[^[2]] 

ME/CFS is found in all ages and socioeconomic groups.​[^[3]] The estimated prevalence is approximately 1%.​[^[4]] However, approximately 90% of people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed and therefore the true prevalence is unknown.​[^[5]] 

The precise underlying disease mechanisms of ME/CFS remain elusive (see Table 1). Several studies have found gene expression changes consistent with the state of chronic activation of the immune system.​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]] Many of the symptoms experienced by some ME/CFS patients strongly resemble the “sickness behaviour” (fever, malaise, pain, fatigue, poor concentration) that can be induced by the administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines.​[^[10]] Canadian Blood Services continues to defer individuals with a medical history of ME/CFS from donating blood, citing the lack of consensus among medical professionals regarding the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and concerns that it may be linked to infectious agents potentially transmissible through transfusion.​[^[11]]

#### Prognosis

While the prognosis remains unclear, it is estimated that full recovery occurs in only 5% of ME/CFS patients.​[^[22]] It is therefore important to explain to the patient that the condition is managed rather than cured. Current research is aimed at identifying a specific biomarker that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and to aid in understanding the pathophysiology.

#### Research Developments

In August 2019, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded the first team grant for myalgic encephalomyelitis. The grant was awarded to ICanCME: Interdisciplinary Canadian Collaborative ME Research Network and has been renewed for 2025.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

ME/CFS is a clinical diagnosis, relying entirely on a combination of signs and symptoms and the exclusion of other chronic *active* illnesses that can produce chronic fatigue: *well-controlled* medical conditions do not preclude a diagnosis of ME/CFS if the patient otherwise meets the criteria. Although a diagnosis of ME/CFS cannot be conclusively made before 6 months of fatigue, clinical evaluation should proceed in the interim to rule out other potentially treatable causes of fatigue. Of note, fibromyalgia, mast cell activation syndrome,​[^[23]]​[^[24]] hypermobility spectrum disorders including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,​[^[25]] sleep apnea and irritable bowel syndrome are all common comorbidities.

Several diagnostic criteria exist. The most commonly used include the 2015 National Institutes of Health/Institute of Medicine criteria (see Table 2) and the 2003 Canadian consensus diagnostic criteria (CCC).​[^[26]] The more specific CCC criteria (see Figure 1) are better able to differentiate ME/CFS from psychiatric conditions and are therefore preferred, particularly in research.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke​[^[5]] supported a common data element project for ME/CFS in 2017 to streamline patient data collection and to determine the preferred tools used in the assessment or examination of patients.​[^[28]] For example, the Beighton score for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the 10-minute NASA Lean test for orthostatic intolerance and the Compass-31 questionnaire are the commonly recommended tools for dysautonomia assessment.

Laboratory tests should be normal. Neither viral titers nor neuroimaging studies are required or generally helpful in routine clinical practice. A full summary of laboratory and imaging tests to carry out in patients with suspected ME/CFS has been published by the US ME/CFS Clinician Coalition.​[^[29]]

| Diagnosis requires that the patient have the following symptoms: | Plus at least 1 of the 2 following manifestations: |
| --- | --- |
| A substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities, that persists for more than 6 months and is accompanied by fatigue, which is often profound, is of new or definite onset (not lifelong), is not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and is not substantially alleviated by rest.Postexertional malaise (PEM) due to systemic exertion intolerance, manifested as an exacerbation of some or all of an individual’s symptoms after seemingly minor physical or cognitive exertion or activity. PEM may result in flulike symptoms; pain; cognitive dysfunction; nausea/gastrointestinal discomfort; weakness/instability; lightheadedness/vertigo; sensory changes; depression/anxiety; sleep disturbances; and difficulty recovering capacity. PEM may be delayed and is unpredictable in duration, potentially lasting hours, days, weeks, and even months. Subjective reports of PEM can be supported by failure to normally reproduce exercise test results (2-day cardiopulmonary exercise tests) and impaired cognitive function. However, this test may induce severe exacerbation of symptoms and is not required for diagnosis.Sleep Abnormalities, which may include insomnia, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep and nonrestorative sleep. Unrefreshing sleep is among the most common symptoms reported by patients. | Cognitive Impairment, which may include short-term memory problems, inability to concentrate, difficulty expressing thoughts, confusion, disorientation and difficulty performing simple activities such as watching television. Slowed information processing is common and may play a role in overall neurocognitive impairment. Neuropsychological testing is not necessary for diagnosis; however, it can be used to observe slowed information processing, memory impairments, reduced attention and impaired psychomotor function.Orthostatic Intolerance, measured by objective heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities and physical findings during standing, bedside orthostatic vital signs, head-up tilt testing, or by patient-reported exacerbation of orthostatic symptoms with standing in day-to-day life. |

#### Therapeutic Choices

There are no specific treatments that have been proven to be effective in large randomized trials for ME/CFS, although several interventions can improve symptoms and quality of life. Patients benefit from receiving a positive diagnosis with reasonable explanations of their symptoms. A supportive environment and acknowledgment of suffering are imperative, and treatment should stress nonpharmacologic approaches.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Although no definitive pharmacotherapy exists for ME/CFS, patients’ symptoms may be effectively managed and quality of life improved with several medications as needed. Treatment should be individualized and start with the most disruptive symptoms.



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

A case series involving 252 pregnancies was published describing the effects of pregnancy on ME/CFS symptoms and vice versa.​[^[53]] During pregnancy, there was no change in ME/CFS symptoms in 41% of subjects, an improvement of symptoms in 30% and a worsening of symptoms in 29%. After pregnancy, there was no change in 30% of subjects, an improvement in 20% and a worsening in 50%. There was a significantly higher rate of spontaneous abortions and a correspondingly lower rate of live births by vaginal delivery, a finding that could also be due to age or parity. Developmental delays or learning disabilities were significantly more frequent in children born from pregnancies that occurred after the onset of ME/CFS. Larger, prospective-controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.

During pregnancy and breastfeeding, continue nonpharmacologic treatment measures that have been effective. If there is coexisting depression, the risk/benefit ratio may favour continuing treatment with antidepressants during pregnancy and afterwards (see Depression). Medication for other conditions should be reevaluated and adjusted as clinically indicated to protect the fetus.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for diagnosing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) based on specific criteria. Here's a detailed description:

### Initial Criteria
- **New onset, unexplained, persistent fatigue that substantially reduces activity.**

### Initial Assessment
1. **Conduct the following:**
   - History, physical, and mental status exam.
   - Neurologic and structured psychiatric exam if indicated.
   - Routine laboratory tests.
   - Any additional tests as indicated from examinations.

### Decision Point: Lab and Exam Results
- **If results are not normal:** Investigate for other conditions causing fatigue.
- **If results are normal:** Proceed to assess symptoms.

### Symptom Assessment
- **Are all of the following present?**
  - Postexertional malaise or fatigue with pathologic slow recovery.
  - Sleep dysfunction.
  - Pain in muscles and joints.
  - Neurologic or cognitive manifestations (at least 2 of the following):
    - Confusion.
    - Impairment of concentration and short-term memory consolidation.
    - Disorientation.
    - Difficulty with information processing, categorizing, and word retrieval.
    - Perceptual and sensory disturbances, e.g., spatial instability and disorientation.
    - Inability to focus vision.
    - Ataxia, muscle weakness, fasciculations.
    - Cognitive/sensory hypersensitivities to stimuli, e.g., photophobia and hypersensitivity to noise and/or emotional overload, which may lead to "crash" periods and/or anxiety.

### Additional Criteria
- **PLUS: At least 1 symptom in 2 of the following 3 categories:**

  **Autonomic Manifestations:**
  - Orthostatic intolerance (neutrally mediated hypotension [NMH], postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS], delayed postural hypotension).
  - Lightheadedness.
  - Extreme pallor.
  - Nausea and irritable bowel syndrome.
  - Urinary frequency and bladder dysfunction.
  - Palpitations with or without cardiac arrhythmias.
  - Exertional dyspnea.

  **Neuroendocrine Manifestations:**
  - Loss of thermostatic stability, e.g., subnormal body temperature and marked diurnal fluctuation, sweating episodes, recurrent feelings of feverishness and cold extremities.
  - Intolerance of extremes of heat and cold.
  - Marked weight change, anorexia or abnormal appetite.
  - Loss of adaptability and worsening of symptoms with stress.

  **Immune Manifestations:**
  - Tender lymph nodes, recurrent sore throat, recurrent flulike symptoms, general malaise, or new sensitivities to food, medications, or chemicals.

### Final Decision
- **If all criteria are met and fatigue has persisted for more than 6 months:** Diagnose as ME/CFS.
- **If criteria are not met:** Consider idiopathic chronic fatigue.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing ME/CFS by evaluating specific symptoms and ruling out other conditions.
