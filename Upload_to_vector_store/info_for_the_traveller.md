#### Introduction

All travellers should consult the Government of Canada’s official source of travel information, Travel Advice and Advisories, in advance of departure and during travel, e.g., in 2020 all non-essential international travel was restricted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today's travellers seem to be exposed to more risks than they ever have in the past. A number of factors, ranging from an aging population to global warming, have contributed to this situation. Ease of travel has also allowed the development of areas of the world that were once considered exotic and remote. While the presence of resorts at these destinations supports the comfort of the traveller, it can give the traveller a false sense of security with regard to the health risks that may be present. Canada has an aging population with the financial means and the desire to travel; however, seniors are more likely to suffer from chronic medical conditions and are less likely to receive optimal benefit from vaccinations, two factors that leave them at increased risk for travel-related illnesses. Many Canadians also travel abroad to visit friends or relatives (VFR). This demographic of travellers is at increased risk of travel-related illness due to more rural, last-minute travel itineraries. VFR travellers are also less likely to seek advice from a travel healthcare professional.​[^[1]]

Generally speaking, any traveller to a tropical destination or developing country should receive a pretravel assessment from a health-care practitioner certified in travel health. The assessment will identify current risks for the traveller based on that person’s intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Intrinsic risk factors refer to the traveller’s underlying health risks and include existing medical conditions and immunization history. Extrinsic risk factors refer to the health risks inherent to the destination and the type of activities the traveller is planning. This information will guide the clinician in providing a comprehensive pretravel consultation. To assess the traveller’s needs, key information will be required, including the destination, time to departure, types of activities planned, an up-to-date vaccination history and a list of current medications.

The focus of this chapter is the pretravel consultation, which may include discussion of the following major topics: immunizations, vectorborne diseases, malaria chemoprophylaxis, respiratory illnesses, self-treatable conditions, environmental hazards and personal safety. Nonprescription medications and health-care advice to assist the patient in reducing health risks will be highlighted in the chapter. Online references can support travellers in making informed decisions about their travel health needs, including the need to seek a pretravel assessment from a qualified health-care practitioner. Those who frequently assist travellers seeking pretravel information will find it beneficial to make themselves familiar with online references provided within this chapter.

#### Immunizations

Vaccines for travellers can be divided into the following 3 categories: those required on the basis of international health regulations (e.g., yellow fever, polio, meningitis vaccines),​[^[2]] those recommended on the basis of risk at the destination, and routine vaccines recommended as a preventive health measure. Recommendations for destination-specific immunization can be found in Travel Health Information Resources. Recommended routine adult vaccinations for Canadians are provided by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI).​[^[3]] Provincial immunization schedules can also assist in identifying immunization gaps for travellers.​[^[4]]

 Ideally, a vaccination assessment for travel should be done at least 4 weeks before departure because certain vaccines require multiple doses. Immunization records should be reviewed to determine prior vaccination history. If records are not available and serologic testing is not possible, the traveller should be considered nonimmune.​[^[2]] Screen for pregnant and immunocompromised travellers when considering vaccination. Review recommendations for spacing administration of live vaccines, inactivated vaccines and blood products (see CDC Yellow Book). Finally, travellers should be questioned on allergies and adverse reactions to immunizations or immunization products before being vaccinated.

#### Vectorborne Diseases

A vector is an organism that plays a role in the transmission of a pathogen between humans or from animal to human.​[^[5]] Vectors include fleas, flies, mosquitoes, ticks and certain freshwater snails (see CDC Yellow Book for a complete list). Mosquitoes are important vectors; the *Anopheles* mosquito is responsible for transmission of malaria and the *Aedes* mosquito transmits the chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses (see Table 1).

A traveller's risk of exposure to a vector depends on the destination, the type and location of accommodations, the duration of the visit, and the type of travel planned. Consult Travel Health Information Resources to help travellers determine whether their itinerary includes areas where vectorborne diseases are endemic and review precautions they can take to prevent insect bites. Advise travellers to endemic areas to make an appointment at a travel clinic for more information on vectorborne diseases and preventive measures.

Risk-reduction strategies include sleeping in well-screened or air-conditioned areas, sleeping under mosquito nets (preferably insecticide-treated), wearing clothing that provides good coverage (e.g., long sleeves, trousers, socks), and using insect repellents. In regions where schistosomiasis (transmitted by freshwater snails) is endemic, contact with fresh water (e.g., lakes, slow-running streams) should be avoided.​[^[20]] When hiking in tick-endemic areas, closed-toed footwear should be worn and pants should be tucked into socks. Additionally, hikers should check for burrowing ticks on the skin after each trek.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

Screens and mosquito nets should have a mesh size of 1.5 mm or less and should be checked regularly for holes. Mosquito nets impregnated with insecticides (e.g., permethrin) are significantly more effective in preventing malaria than nets without insecticide. Impregnated nets also deter entry by vectors smaller than the mesh size of the net (e.g., sandflies) and are safe for use by children and pregnant women. Permethrin-treated nets remain effective even after laundering. All mosquito nets should either reach the floor all around the bed or be tucked under the mattress. In areas with high pyrethroid resistance, there may be some benefit to combining treated nets with non-pyrethroid insecticide sprays.​[^[23]]

#### Insect Repellents

Health Canada recommends using a repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) or icaridin (picaridin).​[^[24]] The duration of effect of insect repellents varies according to a number of factors, including the concentration of repellent and amount applied, temperature, and, possibly, wind conditions.​[^[21]] It is decreased by sweating, washing and abrasion. Various concentrations of DEET and icaridin are available and these vary in their duration of effect.​[^[24]] Using a formulation containing more than 30% DEET is not recommended, since the duration of effect is not lengthened above this concentration but the risk of toxicity may be increased.​[^[24]] In children 6 months to 1 year of age, a product containing DEET 10% or less should be applied daily. DEET 10% can be applied 3 times a day in children 2–12 years of age.​[^[24]] In Canada, DEET and icaridin products are not recommended for use in children under 6 months of age. In areas where malaria and other insect-borne diseases are endemic, the risk of severe disease outweighs any risk from properly applied products.​[^[24]] DEET has been shown to cross the placenta. However, although there are few formal studies, there is no evidence that the use of DEET by pregnant or breastfeeding women poses a health hazard to unborn babies or children who are breastfeeding.​[^[25]] See Insect Bites and Stings for more information on available insect repellents.

Permethrin is a highly effective insecticide and repellent if applied correctly to clothing. It is possible to purchase clothing pretreated with permethrin; the product labels of these clothes indicate the duration of repellent efficacy relative to the number of times the clothing has been laundered. Alternatively, travellers can treat their clothing with permethrin themselves. Repellent should be applied 24–48 hours in advance of travel in order to allow sufficient drying time and must be reapplied after each laundering.​[^[22]]

#### Respiratory Illnesses

Respiratory infections are a common reason for returning travellers to seek medical care, with incidence rates of 20% in all travellers.​[^[26]] Factors contributing to respiratory infections include influenza (which has year-round circulation in the tropics), air pressure changes during ascent and descent of an aircraft, transmission on modes of transportation, and poor air quality at certain destinations.​[^[27]] Some travellers have a higher risk for respiratory tract infections, including children, the elderly, and individuals with underlying pulmonary conditions such as asthma and COPD.

Vaccinations are available to prevent a number of respiratory diseases (see Viral Pharyngitis and the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Acute Rhinosinusitis, Community-Acquired Pneumonia, Influenza and Viral Rhinitis). In addition, travellers should be advised to reduce their risk of respiratory infections by avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated public spaces and transportation, washing their hands frequently and minimizing contact with those who are coughing and/or sneezing. Travellers with underlying respiratory conditions should avoid outdoor activities in environments with poor air quality, excessive pollution can lead to an exacerbation or worsening of these conditions abroad.​[^[28]]

#### Self-Treatable Conditions

It is an unfortunate reality that some travellers will become ill while abroad. Accessing medical care and quality medications in developing countries can be both difficult and dangerous. Therefore it is preferred that health-care providers educate travellers about self-diagnosing and treating common conditions encountered abroad. The self-treatable conditions often encountered during travel are high-altitude illness and jet lag. Two other common issues are motion sickness (see Nausea and Vomiting) and travellers’ diarrhea (see Travellers' Diarrhea).

#### High-Altitude Illness

Travellers to destinations at altitudes above 2000 metres are at risk of altitude-induced illness.​[^[29]] This term encompasses acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).​[^[30]] Symptoms of AMS typically occur within the first 48 hours after reaching a new altitude, especially with rapid ascent. The symptoms of HACE and HAPE result from the extravascular movement of fluid in the brain and lungs. HACE is the end-stage of AMS and can be fatal. The progression to HACE from mild AMS ranges from 12 hours to 3 days. HAPE can occur without pre-existing AMS and accounts for most deaths from high-altitude illness.​[^[30]] Symptoms for each type of altitude illness are listed in Table 2.

| Acute Mountain Sickness(AMS) | High-Altitude Cerebral Edema(HACE) | High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema(HAPE) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In the setting of a recent gain in altitude, the presence of headache and at least 1 of the following symptoms:Gastrointestinal (anorexia, nausea or vomiting)Fatigue or weaknessDizziness or lightheadednessDifficulty sleeping | In the setting of a recent gain in altitude, either:The presence of a change in mental status and/or ataxia in a person with AMS, orThe presence of both mental status changes and ataxia in a person without AMS | In the setting of a recent gain in altitude, the presence of the following:Symptoms—at least 2 of: Dyspnea at restCoughWeakness or decreased exercise performanceChest tightness or congestion Signs—at least 2 of:Crackles or wheezing in at least 1 lung fieldCentral cyanosisTachypneaTachycardia |


While there are individual variations in susceptibility, the risk of illness increases directly with the rate of ascent, the altitude at which one sleeps and the altitude reached.​[^[32]] At altitudes between 2000 and 3500 metres, 9–34% of travellers will experience symptoms of AMS. Above 4000 metres, 42% will experience these symptoms.​[^[29]]

Gradual, stepwise ascent is the best method of prevention. Travellers should heed the following:



Travellers should avoid alcohol, sedative-hypnotics and heavy exertion at high altitude.​[^[32]] In addition, prophylaxis with acetazolamide 125 mg PO twice daily is indicated for rapid ascents (24 hours or less) to >3000 metres and rapid increases in sleeping altitude (e.g., 1000-metre increase in altitude within 24 hours). Acetazolamide 250 mg PO twice daily can also treat AMS if started early enough after symptoms appear.​[^[29]] Travellers should be aware of the side effects of acetazolamide, which include frequent urination and paresthesia. Those with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to sulphonamides should not be prescribed acetazolamide.​[^[33]] Dexamethasone 4 mg PO twice daily for up to 10 days may be used to prevent symptoms, but does not improve acclimatization and should be used in combination with temporary descent so as to facilitate acclimatization.​[^[29]]​[^[32]]

Treatment of AMS includes rest and acclimatization at the same altitude. This may take between 12 hours and 4 days. Simple analgesics, e.g., ibuprofen 200 mg PO every 6 hours, may help treat headache. Descent of at least 500 metres is indicated if AMS is severe, if symptoms progress during acclimatization, or if symptoms of HACE or HAPE occur.​[^[32]] Urgent medical care is needed when descent is not possible, as in the case of injury to the traveller or severe weather conditions.

#### Jet Lag

Jet lag presents with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, disruption of sleep-wake cycles, irritability and impaired cognitive performance, which result from rapidly crossing multiple time zones and attempting to follow the time schedule at the new destination.​[^[34]] Typically, these symptoms are more severe when travelling eastward than westward.​[^[34]] This is because it is easier to adjust by extending the day rather than shortening it.​[^[34]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]] As a general rule, it takes 1 day to acclimatize for every hour of time difference at the new destination.

Nonpharmacologic methods of minimizing jet lag symptoms include:​[^[34]]​[^[35]]



Endogenous melatonin is produced in the pineal gland.​[^[34]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]] It is normally secreted at nighttime, between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Melatonin acts on the internal clock governing circadian rhythms, such as sleeping and body temperature. When these rhythms are disrupted, as with jet lag, sleep disturbances can occur. Several studies show that exogenous melatonin is effective in alleviating the symptoms of jet lag at doses of 3–5 mg daily.​[^[38]] Timing of the administration appears to be important. Melatonin taken in advance of departure may actually worsen the symptoms of jet lag compared to melatonin taken nightly starting after arrival at the destination.​[^[39]] It may be more effective to take a lower dose (0.5 mg) of melatonin later in the night when crossing multiple time zones on westward trips so as to avoid overlap with endogenous secretion.​[^[37]] Dosage form also appears to be important. Sustained-release preparations seem to be less effective than immediate-release formulations.​[^[38]] In studies, melatonin was effective when taken for 3–5 days after arrival,​[^[38]]​[^[39]] but it can be continued until symptoms of jet lag (e.g., daytime fatigue) subside.​[^[40]] Travellers should be aware that short-term use of melatonin can cause abdominal cramps, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, irritability, nightmares and transient depressive symptoms, but the incidence of these adverse reactions is low.​[^[38]]

#### Travel First Aid Kits

It is important that travellers bring a supply of quality medications from Canada for treating their chronic conditions, and for new conditions encountered abroad. First aid kits designed for various types of travel can be purchased from camping equipment stores. Basic first aid kits can be purchased from the Canadian Red Cross or from St. John Ambulance. Alternatively, first aid kits can be prepared by purchasing the necessary supplies from a pharmacy. The contents of these kits will vary depending on the destination, remoteness and type of travel. A partial list of medications and supplies that could be included in a first aid kit can be found in Table 3. Items for first aid kits should be organized in a sealed plastic bag or a plastic box.

| Oral Medications | Topical Medications | First aid supplies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analgesic | Antibiotic cream/ointment | Adhesive bandages | Paper and pencil |
| Antacid | Antifungal cream | Adhesive tape | Respiratory face mask |
| Antidiarrheal | Antipruritic lotion | Alcohol-based hand gel | Safety pins |
| Antihistamine | Corticosteroid cream | Condoms | Scissors |
| Antiseptic agent | Insect repellent | Fine tweezers | Sterile gauze |
| Decongestant | Sunscreen | Ice pack | Syringes and needles |
| Emergency contraception |  | Latex or vinyl gloves | Thermometer |
| Laxative |  | Matches and candle | Triangular bandages |
| Oral rehydration solutions |  | Moleskin |  |


#### Medications

For comparative features or ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*.

##### Oral

**Analgesics:** Acetaminophen is effective for the relief of mild to moderate pain and the reduction of fever (see Fever). Ibuprofen or naproxen will effectively relieve pain and fever and help in controlling inflammation. Caution travellers to dengue endemic areas that the use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of hemorrhage.​[^[41]] 

**Antacids:** An antacid (e.g., calcium carbonate, aluminum and magnesium hydroxide) is effective in the relief of indigestion and heartburn (see Dyspepsia and GERD).

**Antidiarrheals:** Both loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate are effective in the management of mild to moderate travellers' diarrhea.​[^[42]] There is better evidence to support loperamide for this, and it may also be used as an adjunct to antibiotics for faster symptom relief.​[^[43]] Bismuth subsalicylate can also be used as a preventive agent.​[^[44]] More severe symptoms (e.g., cramps, bloody diarrhea, fever) require antibiotic therapy without loperamide (see Travellers' Diarrhea).

**Antihistamines:** Antihistamines can be used to treat minor allergic reactions (see Allergic Rhinitis and Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis). Certain antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate) are useful to control symptoms associated with motion sickness​[^[45]] (see Nausea and Vomiting).

**Antiseptics:** Clean water can be used to wash minor cuts or abrasions. If the risk of infection is high, cleanse the area with hydrogen peroxide 3% or isopropyl alcohol 70% to prevent skin infections (see Minor Cuts and Wounds).

**Decongestants:** Oral pseudoephedrine is useful in adults for relieving congested eustachian tubes during descent of an aircraft.​[^[46]] Topical decongestants are generally not useful for this purpose​[^[46]] (see Complications Affecting the Ear: Ear Piercing, Foreign Bodies and Barotrauma).

**Emergency contraception:** Oral levonorgestrel is available without a prescription at pharmacies and can be used by female travellers to significantly reduce the risk of pregnancy in instances of contraceptive method failure (e.g., broken condom), unprotected consensual intercourse or in cases of sexual assault​[^[47]]​[^[48]] (see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods).

**Laxatives:** A laxative may be helpful for constipation arising from factors associated with travel; e.g., dietary changes, dehydration (see Constipation).

**Oral rehydration solutions:** Oral rehydration solutions prevent dehydration due to travellers' diarrhea (see Diarrhea and Travellers' Diarrhea). Alternatively, sports drinks, diluted 1:1 with potable water offer an alternative means of rehydration.​[^[49]]

##### Topical

**Antibiotic creams or ointments:** A topical antibiotic (e.g., polymyxin B/gramicidin/bacitracin) can be used on superficial wounds likely to become infected (see Minor Cuts and Wounds).

**Antifungal creams:** Antifungal cream (e.g., clotrimazole, miconazole) can be used to treat topical *Candida* infections associated with heat and humidity​[^[50]] (see Fungal Skin Infections).

**Antipruritic lotions:** Lotions containing local anesthetics and antipruritics provide temporary relief of itchiness associated with mild allergic reactions​[^[51]] (see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis and Insect Bites and Stings).

**Corticosteroid creams:** Hydrocortisone 0.5% or 1% cream is useful in various skin conditions such as mild dermatitis and pruritus. Hydrocortisone lotion is more effective in treating larger areas. Clobetasone 0.05% is slightly more potent than hydrocortisone and also available without a prescription for the treatment of similar conditions​[^[52]] (see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis).

**Insect repellents:** Insect repellents containing DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or icaridin are effective against a variety of mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, chiggers and flies. Preparations containing soybean oil 2% and p-menthane 3,8 diol (PMD; oil of lemon eucalyptus) are also effective (see Insect Bites and Stings).

**Sunscreens:** Sunscreen with a SPF of 30 or greater and UVA blockers (e.g., mexoryl, parsol) helps prevent sunburn (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage).

#### Environmental Hazards

Environmental hazards that may be present in developing countries should be discussed with travellers. Hazards may be the result of temperature extremes (heat- and cold-induced illnesses), the safety of drinking water or animal-borne diseases.

#### Heat Illnesses

Trips to warmer climates put travellers at risk for heat-induced illness, typically classified as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat exhaustion occurs when the core body temperature rises to between 37°C and 40°C. Heat stroke occurs at core temperatures greater than 40°C, although elevated temperature is not required for diagnosis. It may take up to 10 days for the thermoregulatory system to fully adapt to increased demands placed on it by high temperatures and humidity.​[^[53]] See Heat-Related Disorders for a discussion of the signs and symptoms of various heat-related illnesses and their management.

Travellers can take steps to prevent heat-related illnesses including the following:



Be especially cautious if medications that increase the risk of heat-related illnesses are being used, such as amphetamines, anticholinergics, antiepileptics (e.g., topiramate), antipsychotics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, MAOIs and sympathomimetics.​[^[54]]

#### Cold Illnesses

Cold illnesses involve either changes in core body temperature (hypothermia) or localized cold-induced tissue injury (e.g., frostbite).

Hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature of less than 35°C. It can be further classified as mild (core body temperature >32°C–<35°C), moderate (core temperature 28–32°C) or severe (core temperature <28°C).

Frostbite is defined as tissue necrosis resulting from localized hypothermia of peripheral tissues.​[^[55]] More details can be found in Frostbite.

Certain medical conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease) and use of medications/substances (e.g., alcohol, antipsychotics, clonidine, meperidine, nicotine/tobacco, sedatives) predispose travellers to cold illnesses. Environmental factors such as wind and moisture can increase the risk of cold illnesses.​[^[56]]

In general, medical treatment should be sought immediately for cold-related illnesses, as inappropriate rewarming can cause complications. For mild hypothermia, external rewarming (e.g., blankets) is usually sufficient if the affected person is able to generate heat through shivering. Moderate to severe hypothermia is considered a medical emergency.​[^[56]]

#### Water Concerns for Travellers

Safe drinking water is essential for travellers to foreign countries, as well as for backpackers within Canada who rely on water from streams, ponds, rivers and lakes.

Processed bottled water or other bottled beverages are preferable sources of fluids, but not always accessible while travelling. If bottled beverages are used, the seals on the bottles should be checked to ensure they have not been refilled with unprocessed liquids. Otherwise, the methods listed below should be used to treat water prior to consumption. Travellers should take care to wipe the mouth of bottles and cans in order to avoid ingesting fecal matter from products stored in unsanitary or infested warehouses.

#### Unsafe Water

Drinking unsafe water may result in acute infections within hours or days, marked by vomiting, diarrhea, fever, malaise and/or abdominal pain. Diseases contracted by drinking contaminated water may be of viral, bacterial or protozoal origin and include amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica), cholera, cryptosporidiosis, Escherichia coli enteritis, giardiasis (Giardia lamblia), hepatitis A, *Shigella* enteritis and typhoid fever.​[^[57]]​[^[58]] A survey of travellers showed that young people were more likely to experience gastrointestinal illness.​[^[59]] Except for E. coli, cholera, typhoid and hepatitis A, vaccines are not available to protect travellers against most of these diseases. Simple precautions to minimize the risk of infection are described in Travellers' Diarrhea.

Water treatment methods outlined in this chapter are directed at preventing infectious illnesses from bacteria, viruses and protozoa. However, environmental contaminants (e.g., copper, mercury, lead, pesticides, herbicides) may also exist in water that has not been processed for human consumption. It is best to verify with a local guide whether the drinking water source is suitable for humans.

While physical appearance is not a reliable indicator of safety, turbidity may not only indicate contamination, but may also interfere with disinfection.​[^[58]] Cloudy water should be strained through a filter.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[60]] It can then be boiled or chemically treated with iodine. Once purified, water should be stored in clean, covered containers to reduce the chance of recontamination. Water treated with chlorine or iodine remains drinkable for several days without refrigeration. 

#### Recommended Water Treatment Methods

#### Heat

Boiling water is the most reliable, and therefore the preferred, method of purifying water for drinking.​[^[58]] Boiling eliminates bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Water should be boiled vigorously for 1 minute then allowed to cool to room temperature.​[^[58]] Boiled water may taste flat; adding a pinch of salt or oxygenating the water by pouring the water back and forth between 2 clean containers can improve the taste.

#### Iodine

Iodination is recommended only for short-term use (<2 weeks) if boiling is not feasible.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[60]] Contact time of the iodine in water should be extended if the water is very cold or cloudy. Ideally, to remove protozoal cysts such as G. lamblia and *Cryptosporidium*, water should be first poured through a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micrometre or less, then iodinated to kill viruses and bacteria.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[60]] Iodination should be used with caution in children and avoided in pregnant women and travellers with thyroid disease.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[60]] Prolonged ingestion of iodine may lead to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, goitre, hypersensitivity, iodism or poisoning, which is manifested by corrosion of the GI tract, metallic taste, vomiting and abdominal pain.​[^[61]] Iodine also crosses the placenta and is transferred into breast milk.​[^[61]] Iodine may stain and imparts an unpleasant taste to the water; palatability can be improved by adding a vitamin C tablet or powdered drink crystals prior to consumption. Table 4 lists iodine products appropriate for water purification and describes their use. 

#### Chlorine

Treatment of water with **chlorine bleach** is not as reliably effective as iodine (see Table 4). Chlorine treatment alone may not kill some enteric viruses, G. lamblia and E. histolytica cysts, and Cryptosporidium species.​[^[58]] Another product, chlorine dioxide, does kill *Giardia* effectively and has moderate effectiveness against *Cryptosporidia*.​[^[62]] Chlorine dioxide does not have an unpleasant taste, but is appropriate for only short-term use.

#### Filters

Water treatment devices such as filters, micro filters or portable iodine-impregnated resin devices are available from camping equipment stores. Filters or micro filters are available with small pore sizes (0.1–0.3 micrometre). They may remove protozoa, G. lamblia cysts and large bacteria, but will not remove viruses.​[^[60]] However since viruses are less common, filtration alone may be sufficient in some situations. Filtration may also complement heating or iodine treatment if it is used first to remove large particles.

Filters with iodine-impregnated resins are more effective against bacteria than protozoa and viruses. The contact time with the iodine in the filter is too short to kill *Giardia* in cold water, *Cryptosporidium* and some viruses.​[^[45]]

#### UV Light

UV light is an effective method of water purification, killing both bacteria and viruses in water. The effect is UV dose dependent and depends on the exposure time of the light on the organism. Portable units are an effective way to disinfect small quantities of water, with larger quantities needing an external power source. It is important to note that disinfection by UV light works optimally in clear water, as cloudy water with suspended particles can shield microorganisms.​[^[60]]

#### Animal-Borne Illnesses

Animal-borne illnesses are transmitted to humans via bites, scratches, ingestion or inhalation. Travellers should be advised to avoid contact with animals to reduce the risk of rabies transmission, particularly stray dogs, monkeys and bats. Children are at increased risk, since the incidence of animal-related injuries and infections is higher in this age group.​[^[63]] Travellers should consume food that is fully-cooked and avoid unpasteurized milk to avoid potential infection.



#### Personal Safety

Education on risk-reduction strategies are important to ensure safe travel abroad. Accidents such as motor vehicle collisions and drowning are both common and preventable causes of death for travellers.​[^[67]] A discussion should take place about precautions travellers can take in order to minimize risks such as traffic accidents, excessive alcohol consumption, robbery, personal assault and drowning on their trip. Travellers should check for security bulletins related to their destination and ensure that they have adequate travel health and medical evacuation insurance (see Travel Health Information Resources).

International travel contributes to the spread of drug-resistant sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and puts travellers at risk of acquiring infections with limited treatment options. As there are no vaccines available to prevent infection, travellers should be educated on strategies to reduce their risk of acquiring STIs, namely diligent condom use and avoiding use of drugs and alcohol that could result in disinhibition.​[^[68]]​[^[69]] (See *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*; Sexually Transmitted Infections for more information).

#### Transportation

Travellers with underlying medical conditions who also may be taking medications must plan carefully, especially on long commercial flights. Care must be taken to package all medications appropriately, and arrangements with commercial airlines for certain special requests must be done in advance. Travellers should also be educated on the risks and prevention strategies for venous thromboembolism on flights (see Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis).

Travellers should be educated on strategies to manage motion sickness if their transportation may put them at risk, e.g., cruise ship travel. See Nausea and Vomiting for more information on motion sickness.

#### Travelling with Medication

When travelling, all regularly used medications, as well as any emergency or intermittent-use items (e.g., asthma inhalers, nitroglycerin sprays, epinephrine injectors), should be packed in carry-on luggage. Travellers are advised to take extra amounts of each medication as well as a list of all medications (use the generic or chemical name) in case of emergency. Most pharmacies can prepare a list of current prescription medications, provided those medications were filled at the same pharmacy.

Medication should be stored in the original, labelled container to avoid problems at borders and to facilitate drug identification in case of emergency. Consider placing silica packs in medication vials if extended travel is planned in hot, humid environments.

Travellers who must bring syringes and needles to administer injectable medications (e.g., insulin, low molecular weight heparin) should carry a letter from their physician authorizing such possession, which should be presented at customs. When an itinerary includes significant changes in altitude (above 2000 metres), pressure in vials for injection must be equalized. To do this, insert the needle of an empty syringe (without the plunger) into the upright vial for several seconds. Then proceed with the usual withdrawal and injection procedures.​[^[70]]

Insulin is stable at room temperature for 30 days. Insulin that will not be used within that time period or any medication that requires refrigeration must be kept cool for the duration of travel. This can be accomplished using a cooler or a chilled thermos. The medication should then be refrigerated once the destination is reached.

All nonprescription liquid medications, creams or ointments must be purchased in volumes of 100 mL or less to be allowed through airport security in carry-on luggage, and must be placed in a clear, 1 L resealable plastic bag. This volume limit does not apply to prescription medications.

If tablets or capsules might experience rough handling (e.g., backpacking), blister packing may prevent breakage. Alternatively, placing cotton wool in the prescription vial may be helpful.

Before travelling, people who use cannabis, controlled drugs or nonprescription codeine preparations should check with embassies or consulates of the destination country and any country through which the person will travel en route. Regulations vary, and what is legal in Canada may not be permitted in another country.

Travellers requiring oxygen therapy during air travel should contact the airline in advance.​[^[35]]

Most airlines will accommodate travellers with special diets if informed at least 24 hours in advance.

#### Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis

Long-distance travel is associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) estimated at 0.1–4.8 cases per million travellers.​[^[71]] The incidence of VTE is highest in the first 2 weeks after travel, gradually decreasing to normal 8 weeks afterwards.​[^[72]] The magnitude of this risk depends on a variety of factors:



70–90% of travellers experiencing VTE have 1 or more of the pre-existing individual risk factors listed above.​[^[71]] Travellers at high risk of VTE (e.g., those with cancer, recent surgery, hypercoagulable disorder, obesity) should be assessed by a qualified health-care practitioner. Recommendations to prevent VTE among high-risk travellers on long flights include:



ASA does not appear to reduce the risk of travel-related VTE and is not recommended as prophylaxis in high-risk travellers.​[^[77]]

#### Travel Clinics

When travelling outside Canada or the United States, travellers should plan a pre-trip visit to their healthcare practitioner or a travel clinic at least 4–6 weeks before departure as vaccination requirements vary depending on the travel destination. Specialized travel clinics provide comprehensive travel services consisting of assessment, provision of vaccinations and medications, and information on personal protection against travel risks. Recent data indicates that a lack of risk perception is a main reason travellers do not seek pre-travel advice.​[^[78]] Front-line healthcare providers can play an important role in reducing illness and injury for travellers by informing them of the risks discussed in this chapter and providing management strategies.

Travel clinics are available across Canada. A listing of clinics is available from the Public Health Agency of Canada.
