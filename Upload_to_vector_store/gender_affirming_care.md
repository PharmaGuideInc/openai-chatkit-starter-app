#### Introduction

Gender is a felt sense of one’s identity (e.g., boy, girl, man, woman, nonbinary). There are individual and societal aspects of gender that interact with and influence one another: an individual’s lived experience, including their self-perception of their gender, their outward expression of their gender and cultural expectations based upon perceived gender. These gender norms may influence how people perceive the gender of others, as well as how they react to perceived gender nonconformity.​[^[1]] Sex is a category assigned at birth based mainly on genitalia and chromosomes (e.g., male, female, intersex) and individuals may identify with a gender different than the sex assigned at birth (SAAB). Individuals whose gender identity and SAAB are aligned are described as cisgender. There are many other gender identities and for the purposes of this chapter, the umbrella term transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) will be used as an inclusive term to describe individuals whose gender identity is not aligned with their SAAB.​[^[2]]

Gender incongruence is defined as a marked and persistent experience of incompatibility between an individual’s experienced gender and their SAAB.​[^[3]] Gender-affirming care supports TGD individuals’ identity and can be delivered through social, legal, psychological and/or medical means.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] This chapter focuses on one of the medical pathways for gender-affirming care: endocrine or hormonal therapy.

International professional bodies, including the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)​[^[2]] and the Endocrine Society​[^[6]] have published guidelines with respect to endocrine therapy for TGD patients. These are summarized and placed within the Canadian context in this chapter.

#### Language and Terminology

Language and terminology are evolving and vary across cultures, contexts and communities. Language is also impacted by various factors imposed on TGD people, such as social norms and expectations.​[^[2]] We acknowledge that some of the terms used in this chapter may already be outdated by the time of publication. It is recommended by the WPATH that health-care providers discuss terminology preferences with TGD patients to uphold the principles of safety, dignity and respect.​[^[2]]

Table 1 lists terms that have been adapted from several TGD guidelines and are provided here for reference.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Assigned male at birth (AMAB)Assigned female at birth (AFAB)Assigned sex at birth (ASAB) or sex assigned at birth (SAAB) | A person’s initial designation at birth as male or female depending on the newborn’s genitalia and other visible physical sex characteristics.​[4] |
| Cis or cisgender | An individual whose gender identity is aligned with their sex assigned at birth. An individual who does not have a transgender identity.​[4] |
| Gender dysphoria | The distress experienced by a person whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex assigned at birth. Not all individuals who have TGD identities experience gender dysphoria.​[7] |
| Gender expression | The social expression or presentation of a person’s gender, regardless of gender identity, which may include behaviours and appearances, esthetic choices, language and voice.​[8] |
| Gender identity | A person’s deeply felt, internal, intrinsic sense of their own gender.​[2] |
| Gender incongruence | The state when an individual’s experienced gender does not align with the sex assigned at birth.​[3] |
| Nonbinary | An individual who does not identify with traditional binary gender roles (e.g., man or woman). People who are nonbinary may perceive themselves as having a gender on the spectrum between girl/woman and boy/man, as being multiple genders at once, as having a constantly shifting gender, as having a gender outside the traditional binary system, or as not having a gender at all. Some nonbinary individuals may identify with the terms genderqueer, pangender, genderfluid or agender and may use gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/their).​[2]​[4] |
| Sex | An individual’s phenotype as often determined by external genitalia.​[4] |
| Transgender or transTransgender woman or trans womanTransgender man or trans man | An individual whose gender identity is not aligned with their sex assigned at birth. An individual who does not have a cisgender identity. This may include those who identify as nonbinary.​[4] |
| Transfeminine or transfem | An individual assigned male at birth whose gender expression is on the feminine spectrum. |
| Transmasculine or transmasc | An individual assigned female at birth whose gender expression is on the masculine spectrum. |
| Two-Spirit, 2–Spirit or Two-Spirited | A term used by some Indigenous peoples who identify as diverse gender, sexual and/or spiritual identities.​[4]​[9] |


#### Epidemiology

Statistics Canada collected data on gender for the first time through the Canadian Census of Population in 2021. Results from this census were published in 2022 and provide an insight into the gender diversity that exists in Canada:​[^[10]]



The number of people who identify as TGD is increasing and will likely continue to do so with better clarity of survey terminology, reduction in social stigma and greater legal protection.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

#### Determinants of Health

There are significant health disparities between gender-diverse populations and the general population. In Canada, people who belong to gender minorities are significantly more likely to experience mental health concerns (e.g., unmet mental health needs, substance abuse, mood or anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideations and attempts) compared with the general population,​[^[4]] with a rate of 1 in 3 considering suicide each year and 1 in 20 attempting suicide annually.​[^[13]] Health disparities are further aggravated for individuals with multiple structurally marginalized identities, such as TGD individuals who also identify among other minority or equity seeking groups (e.g., people who are racialized, immigrants, Indigenous or disabled).​[^[14]]​[^[15]] The provision of gender-affirming care is integral to improving the health and well-being of TGD individuals.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Assessment

The WPATH Standards of Care 8 (SOC-8) provides guidance on the assessment of gender dysphoria.​[^[2]] It is important to note that since an individual’s gender identity is an internal identification and experience, the assessment is aimed at identifying gender incongruence and any coexisting mental health concerns, offering gender-affirming medical and/or surgical treatments, providing support to TGD individuals when considering medical and surgical options, and assessing the capacity to understand the treatment being offered. The decision to proceed with treatment or surgical intervention should be the result of informed consent.

The WPATH SOC-8 includes criteria that can be used to identify individuals who qualify for gender-affirming therapy.​[^[2]] Table 2 lists the criteria for gender-affirming hormone therapy. For each patient seeking hormone therapy, it is important to not only consider the possible risks of treatment, but also to consider the often substantial risks of withholding treatment.​[^[4]]

|  |
| --- |
| Criteria for Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Adults |
| Adults are eligible for hormone therapy if:Gender incongruence is marked and sustainedThey meet diagnostic criteria for gender incongruence prior to gender-affirming hormone treatment in regions where a diagnosis is necessary to access health careThey demonstrate capacity to consent to the specific gender-affirming hormone treatmentOther possible causes of apparent gender incongruence have been identified and excludedMental health and physical conditions that could negatively impact the outcome of treatment have been assessed, with risks and benefits discussedThey understand the effect of gender-affirming hormone treatment on reproduction and they have explored reproductive options |
| Criteria for Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy for Adolescents |
| Adolescents are eligible for GnRHa treatment and subsequent sex hormone treatment if:Gender diversity/incongruence is marked and sustained over timeThey meet the diagnostic criteria of gender incongruence in situations where a diagnosis is necessary to access health care They demonstrate the emotional and cognitive maturity required to provide informed consent/assent for the treatmentMental health concerns (if any) that may interfere with diagnostic clarity, capacity to consent and gender-affirming medical treatments have been addressed sufficiently, so that gender-affirming medical treatment can be provided optimallyThey are informed of the reproductive effects, including the potential loss of fertility and the available options to preserve fertilityThey have reached Tanner stage 2 (see Table 4 for Tanner stages) |

#### Assessing Capacity to Consent

Assessing a patient’s ability to consent to proposed treatment is critical during the assessment for hormone and surgical treatment. Consent requires that the patient has the cognitive capacity to understand the risks and benefits of a treatment, as well as the potential outcomes, both positive and negative. It also requires the ability to retain the information provided for the purposes of making the decision, as well as the cognitive ability to use that understanding to make an informed decision.​[^[17]] Clinicians can consider initiating treatment for patients unable to directly consent if “an appropriate legal guardian or regulator-approved independent decision maker with the power to determine healthcare treatment grants consent and confirms the proposed treatment is in alignment with the TGD individual’s needs and wishes.”​[^[2]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

Gender affirmation is a unique determinant of transgender health and well-being globally. It refers to the process of having one’s gender affirmed or recognized. Given the spectrum of gender identity and the variation in each person’s expression, there is no single pathway for a TGD individual to affirm their identity. Some individuals may achieve a reduction in distress through changes in legal identification and modifications to their gait, dress, voice and/or body hair, while others may prefer strategies involving hormones and/or surgeries.​[^[4]] There are 4 key gender-affirmation domains: social, psychological, legal and medical.​[^[5]] The medical domain includes both surgical and hormonal gender-affirming therapy.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Social



#### Psychological

The psychological domain of gender affirmation includes concepts such as possessing a sense of self or authentic identity and having access to trans-competent mental health care. As mentioned in Determinants of Health, TGD individuals are at greater risk of mental health challenges and negative health outcomes related to minority stress. The WPATH recommends that health-care providers understand the impact of social attitudes, laws, economic circumstances, and health systems on the lived experiences of TGD individuals and encourages health-care providers to seek training on the provision of gender-affirming care.​[^[2]]

#### Legal

The legal domain of gender affirmation includes effective antidiscrimination legislation that provides protection against discrimination due to gender identity, gender expression, or bodily diversity and the right to recognition under the law, including the right to legally change one’s name or gender designation.​[^[26]] Although Canada is generally considered progressive with respect to gender diversity, access to care related to gender affirmation, sexual and reproductive health, and general health is still a challenge for many and could be improved with policy changes.​[^[27]]

#### Medical

The medical domain of gender affirmation includes procedures and therapies aimed at reducing gender dysphoria. Guidelines for transgender health care lay the foundation for medical interventions that include voice and communication therapies, gender-affirming surgeries and procedures, hormonal therapies, and reproductive options.​[^[5]]

#### Voice and Communications Therapies

As with all aspects of gender-affirming care, it is important to note that not every TGD person experiences challenges with or requires support for voice and communication. While both testosterone hormonal treatment and laryngeal surgery may be used to modify voice and communication, other practices such as behavioural training by a specialist can also bring desired changes (e.g., to speaking voice, pitch and pitch range, voice quality, voice loudness, facial expressions, gestures).​[^[2]]

#### Gender-Affirming Surgeries and Procedures

Medically necessary gender-affirmation surgery (GAS) refers to the constellation of procedures designed to align a person’s body with their gender identity. Although complications may arise, GAS is recognized as playing a significant role in increasing health-related quality of life and decreasing the symptoms of gender dysphoria. Commonly used surgical interventions and their desired outcomes are listed in Table 3.

| Gender-Affirming Surgery/Procedure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Mastectomy (top surgery/masculinizing chest surgery) | Removal of breast tissue and chest contouring/sculpting of remaining tissue into a shape typically considered more masculine |
| Breast augmentation (top surgery/feminizing chest surgery) | Insertion of implants beneath existing breast tissue to enlarge breasts |
| Metoidioplasty (bottom surgery/masculinizing genital surgery) | Creation of a penis using enlarged clitoral tissue; can include lengthening of the urethra to the tip of the penis​[a]​[b] |
| Phalloplasty (bottom surgery/masculinizing genital surgery) | Creation of a penis, scrotal sac and testes; involves multiple steps including creation of a penis (neophallus), glansplasty (creation of glans penis), urethroplasty (creation of a urethra that travels through the neophallus), scrotoplasty (creation of scrotum and insertion of testicular implants) and, often, insertion of an erectile device |
| Hysterectomy | Removal of the uterus (total hysterectomy involves removal of the cervix as well) |
| Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) | Removal of both fallopian tubes and both ovaries |
| Vaginoplasty (bottom surgery/feminizing genital surgery) | Creation of a vagina and vulva (including mons, labia, clitoris and urethral opening) and removal of the penis, scrotal sac and testes |
| Vulvoplasty (bottom surgery/feminizing genital surgery) | Creation of a vulva without creating a vaginal canal |
| Orchiectomy | Removal of testes and spermatic cord |
| Facial surgery | Alterations to facial bones, cheeks, forehead, nose, hairline, and areas around the eyes, ears or lips |
| Tracheal shave | Reduction or reshaping of thyroid cartilage |
| Voice surgery (laryngeal surgery) | Changes to vocal fold mass and/or tension to raise pitch |
| Liposuction or lipofilling | Removal or transfer of body fat to contour the body and create desired shape |
| Pectoral augmentation | Implants beneath pectoral muscles to increase size and project muscles |
| Electrolysis/Laser | Removal of hair using electric current (electrolysis) or concentrated beam of light (laser) |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Screening and Hormonal Planning Period

The hormonal-planning period allows the health-care provider to become acquainted with the patient, educate the patient regarding the effects and risks of treatment, and discuss the need for interventions such as fertility preservation. The duration of the hormone-planning period may vary depending on the provider’s history with the patient and their experience in providing hormone treatment and the patient’s readiness for initiating treatment.





#### Puberty Suppression

| Stage | Pubic Hair Scale | AFAB Breast Development Scale | AMAB Testicular Volume orTesticular Long Axis Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No hair | No glandular breast tissue palpable | <4 mL or<2.5 cm |
| 2 | Downy hair | Breast bud palpable under the areola(first pubertal sign in people AFAB) | 4–8 mL or2.5–3.3 cm(first pubertal sign in people AMAB) |
| 3 | Scant terminal hair | Breast tissue palpable outside areola; no areolar development | 9–12 mL or3.4–4.0 cm |
| 4 | Terminal hair that fills the entire triangle overlying the pubic region | Areola elevated above the contour of the breast to form secondary mound | 13–20 mL or4.1–4.5 cm |
| 5 | Terminal hair that extends beyond the inguinal crease onto the thighs | Areolar mound recedes into single breast contour with areolar hyperpigmentation, papillae development and nipple protrusion | >20 mL or>4.5 cm |

**Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa)** are often used off-label in transgender youth between Tanner stages 2–5 to suppress puberty. GnRHa flood the pituitary gland’s GnRH receptors, resulting in a down-regulation of the response to endogenous GnRH and sustained suppression of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This results in the cessation of sex hormone (i.e., testosterone or estrogen) production by the gonads, thereby preventing further development of the endogenous secondary sex characteristics or gendered experiences (e.g., erections or menses) corresponding to the SAAB.​[^[4]]​[^[6]]​[^[30]] GnRHa–based pubertal suppression is reversible, with endogenous sex steroid production and puberty/hormonal effects resuming within 6 months of therapy discontinuation.​[^[30]]

The most commonly used GnRHa is leuprolide, a long-acting GnRHa available in 1-, 3- and 6-month dosages. Triptorelin is a long-acting GnRHa that may be considered if leuprolide is contraindicated (e.g., allergy) or unavailable. While neither agent has an indication for gender-affirming care, leuprolide is indicated in children with central precocious puberty, whereas triptorelin has no pediatric indication in Canada. Goserelin is not routinely used for gender-affirming therapy in Canada.

Access to pubertal suppression may result in better psychological and physical outcomes for TGD adolescents desiring such therapy;​[^[31]] however, it is important to discuss some of the significant limitations and adverse effects of such therapies before initiation. GnRHa are typically expensive, so coverage options may need to be invesigated, and they require repeat injections, which may be painful. Possible adverse effects include severe local reactions, headache, mood changes, visual changes, hot flashes and weight gain.​[^[4]] Individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB) may experience a surge bleed after the first dose, and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) may experience a transient increase in frequency of erections after the first dose.​[^[30]] Additionally, prolonged unopposed use (>2 y) without concomitant exogenous estrogen may result in decreased bone mineral density.​[^[4]] While data is lacking in this population, it would be reasonable to suggest weight-bearing physical activity and optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D for bone health in individuals taking GnRHa.​[^[6]]​[^[30]] Initiating GnRHa in early puberty may have both positive and negative implications on future gender-affirming treatments. Lower doses of gender-affirming hormones may be required to achieve desired outcomes and some surgical options may be improved (e.g., chest wall masculinization), but others may be limited (e.g., less scrotal tissue for vaginoplasty).​[^[30]]

Providers offering pubertal suppression using GnRHa should discuss the potential impacts on fertility, as the impact on the maturation of germ cells could affect fertility potential. Given that many trans youth want to preserve fertility potential, temporarily discontinuing or delaying treatment with GnRHa to promote gamete maturation is an option.​[^[6]]​[^[32]]

#### Estrogen-Based Therapy

The goal of estrogen-based therapy is to reduce the endogenous effects of testosterone and to induce feminine secondary sex characteristics congruent with the person’s goals. This is achieved through the introduction of estrogen and medications that inhibit testosterone. This shift in hormones in the body reduces the effects of testosterone and induces both reversible and irreversible feminine sex characteristics.​[^[4]]

There is a lack of consensus on the preferred timing of the initiation of exogenous estrogen in relation to antiandrogen therapy. Approaches include initiating antiandrogen therapy 1–3 months prior to starting estrogen or simultaneously introducing both therapies. Dose titration of antiandrogens and estrogen may be performed over the course of 3–6 months or more and will depend on patient goals, physical response, measured serum hormone levels and other lab results. Evidence is lacking to recommend a particular titration schedule, and dose titration can be tailored to individual patient needs. It is generally agreed that a slow upward titration is best.​[^[4]] The expected time course of physical effects of estrogen-based therapies are outlined in Table 5. It is important for patients to understand that the onset and maximal effects of changes vary greatly between individuals and depend on several factors (e.g., choice of medication, dosage, timing of medication introduction, modifications to regimens).

Estrogen-based therapy is associated with several medical risks that should be considered and discussed with TGD individuals prior to initiation, including the very high risk of thromboembolic disease (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke) and the moderate risk of macroprolactinoma (particularly in combinations including cyproterone), breast cancer, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, cholelithiasis, hypertriglyceridemia, mood changes and depression (higher risk with cyproterone or progesterone), decrease in fertility, hypertension, diabetes, and weight gain.​[^[4]]​[^[6]] Measures to reduce the risks associated with estrogen-based therapy should be considered and discussed with patients and implemented when possible.​[^[4]] Table 6 details a monitoring plan for individuals taking estrogen-based therapies.

| Physical Effects | Reversibility | Expected Onset | Expected Maximum Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Breast growth | Irreversible | 3–6 months | 1–2 y |
| Body fat redistribution | Reversible/variable | 3–6 months | 2–3 y |
| Decreased muscle mass/strength​[a] | Reversible | 3–6 months | 1–2 y |
| Skin softening/decreased sebum | Reversible | 3–6 months | Unknown |
| Decreased facial/chest/pubic hair | Reversible | 6–12 months | >3 y |
| Scalp hair loss cessation | Reversible | 1–3 months | Variable |
| Decreased libido | Variable | 1–3 months | 3–6 months |
| Decreased spontaneous erections | Variable | 1–3 months | 3–6 months |
| Decreased testicular volume | Variable | 3–6 months | 2–3 y |
| Decreased sperm production | Variable | Variable | Variable |


| Parameter | Time Frame |
| --- | --- |
| Appropriate signs of feminization | First year: Q3 monthsSubsequently: 1–2 times/y |
| Development of adverse reactions | First year: Q3 monthsSubsequently: 1–2 times/y |
| Serum testosterone(goal <1.7 nmol/L) | Initially: Q3 monthsOnce at target: Q6–12 months |
| Serum estradiol(not to exceed peak physiologic range: 360–720 pmol/L) | Initially: Q3 monthsOnce at target: Q6–12 months |
| Creatinine/serum electrolytes | Spironolactone: baseline, 4–6 wk postinitiation, Q3 months, and after any dosage changesCyproterone: baseline, Q12 months |
| Routine cancer screening of all tissues present | As per guidelines for nontransgender individuals |
| Bone mineral density (BMD) | Initially: baselineSubsequently: per national guidelines (all patients ≥65 y of age, patients 50–64 y of age with risk factors for fracture, patients <50 y of age with predisposing conditions, this includes patients who have undergone orchiectomy or who have been on low-dose or no estrogen for >2 y; see Osteoporosis) |
| Osteoporosis risk assessment to identify people at higher risk​[a] | Begin screening at 50 y of age​[4] |


###### Antiandrogens

Androgen blockade can minimize or suppress some masculine sex characteristics. Medications that lower and/or block testosterone can be used with estrogens in TGD youth and adults with testes when it aligns with the individual goals for therapy.​[^[2]] The addition of an antiandrogen lowers the dose of estrogen required for feminization (previously supraphysiologic estrogen levels were required for pituitary gonadotropin suppression) and lowers testosterone levels to that of cisgender females.​[^[2]]​[^[34]] Antiandrogens do not reverse the permanent masculinization of the body that occurred during puberty.

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that has direct antiandrogen receptor activity and a suppressive effect on testosterone synthesis. Spironolactone also has weak estrogenic and progestogenic activity.​[^[4]] A significant reduction in serum testosterone levels may not occur from spironolactone use, and effectiveness should be evaluated by the patient’s reported response versus serum levels.​[^[4]] Spironolactone can be stopped immediately after orchiectomy (± vaginoplasty) or tapered over 4–6 weeks in patients with hypertension or renal dysfunction while monitoring blood pressure and fluid status.​[^[4]]

Cyproterone acetate is a potent antiandrogen that works by creating negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary pathway, leading to decreased testicular testosterone secretion, and by competitively blocking androgen receptors.​[^[4]] The desired effects of cyproterone include breast growth, reduced erectile function, reduced prostatic and testicular volume, slowed growth of facial and body hair, and decreased androgenic alopecia. Acute liver damage has been reported, but most reports are in patients taking higher doses than required for estrogen-based therapy.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Baseline ALT and regular monitoring are recommended. Cyproterone has also been associated with the development of meningiomas; these are rare, often benign, tumors of the meninges that are slow-growing and may remain asymptomatic for many years. The risk may be higher with use >2 years and daily doses >10 mg. Routine screening is not recommended, but patients should be aware of risk and monitor for symptoms (changes in vision, hearing loss or ringing in the ears, loss of smell, headaches, memory loss, seizures, or weakness in the arms and legs).​[^[2]]​[^[4]] Conflicting evidence suggests cyproterone may be associated with hyperprolactinemia and prolactinoma. No clear guidance for monitoring has been established; however, it would be reasonable to monitor prolactin when symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinemia present (e.g., visual disturbances, excessive galactorrhea, new-onset headaches).​[^[4]] Cyproterone can be stopped immediately after orchiectomy.​[^[28]]

The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are typically not used in estrogen-based therapy due to their minimal effectiveness as antiandrogens compared with spironolactone and cyproterone, but they may be considered in individuals desiring mild antiandrogenic effects.​[^[4]] Although evidence is lacking, finasteride may be added to estrogen-based therapy for those who exhibit scalp hair loss.​[^[4]]

Cyproterone reduces serum testosterone levels more than spironolactone or estrogen alone, but spironolactone induces feminization regardless of testosterone levels through peripheral blockade. The selection of an antiandrogen agent is best made for each TGD individual based on their medical history and preference regarding risk and adverse effect profiles.​[^[2]]​[^[4]]​[^[35]] Table 11 details the properties of the various antiandrogen therapies.

###### Estrogens

Exogenous estrogen binds to estrogen receptors to trigger the development of feminine secondary sex characteristics. Physical effects attributable to estrogen therapy include breast development; decreased erectile function, testicular volume, sperm production and sexual desire; softer and less oily skin; reduction in coarse facial and body hair; and increased proportion of body fat to lean muscle mass. Estrogen therapy does not alter the pitch of the voice. While estrogen therapy may only minimally affect height in adults, the initiation of estrogen in adolescents prior to the completion of skeletal growth may lead to an earlier cessation of long bone growth and thus shorter adult height, an effect that would be irreversible.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

Options for estrogen therapy include oral or sublingual 17-beta estradiol, transdermal estradiol (as a patch or gel) and injectable estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate (not commercially available in Canada but may be compounded). The synthetic estrogen ethinyl estradiol is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and should be avoided when possible.​[^[6]] Conjugated equine estrogens are no longer recommended due to challenges with monitoring serum levels and potential increased cardiovascular risk.​[^[41]] If an oral formulation is desired, 17–beta estradiol is preferred due to its reduced thrombogenicity versus synthetic or conjugated estrogens.​[^[6]] Expert opinion is that transdermal estrogen formulations are less thrombogenic than oral therapy​[^[42]] and should be considered for patients >40 years of age or with a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease (e.g., thrombophilia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, major surgery, fractures).​[^[2]]​[^[4]]​[^[43]] The large application surface area required for optimal absorption may make transdermal gel formulations less desirable than patches.​[^[6]] It is common practice to discontinue estrogen therapy 2–4 weeks prior to surgical procedures (e.g., vaginoplasty) due to the increased risk of VTE during surgery, although this remains controversial.​[^[4]]​[^[44]]

Most data on thromboembolic risk associated with estrogen treatment is taken from studies on cisgender women. In addition, the lack of standardized hormone regimens for gender-affirming therapy in TGD patients limits the knowledge of adverse effects associated with these therapies in this population. The baseline thromboembolic risk for transfeminine patients prior to the initiation of hormone therapy can be estimated using sex assigned at birth.​[^[4]] Risk assessment becomes more complicated after hormone therapy has been initiated. The Center of Excellence for Transgender Health at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) suggests providers use the risk calculator for sex assigned at birth, affirmed gender, or an average of both, depending on the age of hormone initiation and the duration of hormone exposure.​[^[41]] Monitoring of serum estradiol levels is critical to ensure safe doses and to avoid blood levels of estrogen that may lead to an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, liver dysfunction and hypertension. Table 11 details the properties of the various estrogen therapies.

###### Progestins

TGD individuals may request treatment with progestins as part of their estrogen-based therapy. Both the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines​[^[6]] and the WPATH Standards of Care​[^[2]] state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend progestin use for feminization. The low quality of evidence from relatively few studies suggests that the addition of progestin does not seem to enhance (nor prevent) breast development.​[^[45]] Progestin therapy in TGD individuals has not been shown to reduce breast cancer rates or improve bone mineral density​[^[46]] and there is data to suggest it is associated with VTE.​[^[47]] If progestin therapy is offered for feminization, a frank discussion of risks and expectations is essential and micronized progesterone would be the preferred agent.

#### Testosterone-Based Therapy

The goal of testosterone-based therapy is to develop androgenic sex characteristics congruent with the patient’s goals. These may include effects such as deepened voice, cessation of menses, clitoral growth, increased muscle mass, fat redistribution and hair growth in androgen-dependent areas.​[^[4]] These effects are achieved through the introduction of testosterone, which acts to reduce endogenous estrogen levels. The shift in hormones induces both reversible and irreversible masculine sex characteristics.​[^[4]] The expected time course of physical effects of testosterone-based therapies are outlined in Table 7. It is important for patients to understand that the onset and maximal effects of changes vary greatly between individuals and depend on several factors (e.g., choice of medication, dosage, timing of medication introduction, modifications to regimens). Table 8 details a monitoring plan for individuals taking testosterone-based therapies.

| Physical Effects | Reversibility | Expected Onset | Expected Maximum Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body fat redistribution | Reversible/Variable | 1–6 months | 2–5 y |
| Increased muscle mass/strength​[a] | Reversible | 6–12 months | 2–5 y |
| Skin oiliness/acne | Reversible | 1–6 months | 1–2 y |
| Facial/body hair growth | Irreversible | 3–6 months | 4–5 y |

###### Testosterone

Testosterone is the cornerstone of hormone therapy for transmasculine patients. Physical effects attributable to testosterone therapy include deepened voice, cessation of menses, clitoral growth, increased muscle mass, fat redistribution and body hair growth. Some effects (e.g., changes to the voice and clitoris) are irreversible, which is essential for patients to understand prior to initiating therapy.​[^[4]] The goal of therapy is to achieve serum testosterone concentrations no higher than the male reference range, but clinicians should aim for serum levels that provide changes in line with the patient’s individual goals rather than purely focusing on attaining a specific level.

Options for testosterone therapy include injectable testosterone (testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate) and **transdermal testosterone**. Transdermal preparations provide relatively steady-state testosterone delivery, as opposed to the periodicity associated with injectable dosage forms.​[^[4]] Little evidence is available to support the use of oral or intranasal testosterone in the setting of gender affirmation and it is not addressed by WPATH; health-care providers should use clinical judgment if prescribing these formulations in this setting.​[^[2]]​[^[49]] Table 11 details the properties of the various testosterone therapies.

Risk assessment for testosterone-based therapy should include potential metabolic impacts, cardiovascular events and malignancies.​[^[4]] Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding and in those who have active, known sex hormone–sensitive cancer, unstable ischemic cardiovascular disease, poorly controlled psychosis or acute homicidality.​[^[4]] Conditions that may require risk-reduction strategies include stable ischemic cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled dyslipidemia, hepatic dysfunction, polycythemia, history of DVT/PE or hypercoagulable state, chronic respiratory disease that may be worsened by erythrocytosis/polycythemia, severe or uncontrolled sleep apnea, androgen-sensitive epilepsy, active smoking, migraines, intermenstrual bleeding/menorrhagia, oligo-/amenorrhea, and autoimmune conditions.​[^[4]]

###### Menstrual Management

| Therapy | Dosage | Notes | Amenorrhea Rate at ≥1 y |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Combined oral (estrogen- and progestin-containing) contraceptives | 1 tablet once daily PO; various hormones and dosages in fixed-dose (monophasic) formulations | Typically taken daily for 21 days with 7-day drug-free period during which withdrawal bleeding occurs. For suppression of menses, active drug is taken daily with no drug-free period; continuously or for an extended (12–wk) cycle.Breakthrough bleeding may occur, less common at higher doses of ethinyl estradiol (>20 mcg), decreases with ongoing use.Breast tenderness is common.Requires patient adherence to daily dosing. | 50–88% |
| Combined transdermal contraceptives | 1 patch once weekly topically; ethinyl estradiol 600 mcg/​norelgestromin 6 mg per weekly patch (releases approximately ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg/day, norelgestromin 200 mcg/day) | Typically applied weekly for 3 wk followed by 1 wk patch-free period during which withdrawal bleeding occurs. For suppression of menses, patch is replaced every wk with no patch-free period; continuously or for an extended (12–wk) cycle.Break-through bleeding is common.Breast tenderness is common.Requires patient adherence to weekly dosing. | Limited data available |
| Combined vaginal contraceptives | 1 ring once monthly vaginally; ethinyl estradiol 15 mcg/day, etonogestrel 120 mcg/day | Typically inserted for 3 wk followed by 1 wk ring-free period during which withdrawal bleeding occurs. For suppression of menses, ring is replaced every 4 wk with no ring-free period; continuously or for an extended (12–wk) cycle.Requires patient adherence to monthly dosing. | Up to 89% |
| Norethindrone | 0.35 mg daily PO | Requires patient adherence to daily dosing, ideally at the exact same time each day.Breakthrough bleeding may occur, decreased if adherence to dosing time | 10% |
| Norethindrone acetate | 5 mg daily PO | Requires patient adherence to daily dosing.Breakthrough bleeding may occur; decreased if adherence to dosing time.Not indicated for contraception. | 75–90% |
| Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate | 150 mg IM every 11–13 wk | Breakthrough bleeding is common. | 55% |
| Etonogestrel implant | implant inserted SD every 3 y; etonogestrel 68 mg | Breakthrough bleeding is common. | 20–30% |
| Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) | system inserted IU every 5 y; levonorgestrel 52 mg | Breakthrough bleeding may occur.Lower dosages are available but result in lower rates of amenorrhea. | 50–60% with 52 mg IUS |
| Gonadotropin-releasing hormones | leuprolide at various dosages | Adverse effects (e.g., decreased bone mineral density) limit long-term use for menstrual suppression.Not effective for contraception. | Up to 100% |


#### Considerations around Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Fertility

Research suggests that many TGD individuals do not receive adequate fertility counselling despite desiring parenthood at rates similar to cisgender counterparts. Health-care providers should be familiar with TGD reproductive health and the potential barriers to care. As some medical and surgical gender-affirming therapies may impact the ability to reproduce, comprehensive fertility counselling, including options for fertility preservation, before the initiation of such therapies is critical to the care of gender-diverse patients.​[^[6]]

Sperm maturation and motility may be impacted by long-term estrogen use. It is likely that patients who produce sperm may irreversibly lose the ability to create sperm within a few months of starting hormone therapy.​[^[53]] WPATH recommends TGD individuals with testes bank sperm prior to starting hormone therapy.​[^[2]] Patients who have already started estrogen-based therapy are advised to pause therapy for a few months prior to banking sperm so that the quality and production of sperm can improve. TGD individuals who are considering an orchiectomy must bank sperm before surgery if they wish to retain the option of having genetically related children.​[^[54]]

Long-term testosterone therapy does not affect the quantity, quality or maturation of oocytes (eggs).​[^[54]]​[^[55]] TGD individuals with ovaries may conceive after discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of testosterone therapy. Those planning to have oophorectomies may consider oocyte banking or embryo banking. Oocyte banking involves hormone-induced ovulation and the subsequent retrieval and preservation of the eggs. Embryo banking involves oocyte retrieval followed by immediate fertilization and preservation of the embryo. Eggs and embryos can be implanted into the uterus of the donor, a partner or a surrogate.​[^[54]]

#### Contraception

It is recommended that TGD individuals with testes use a method of birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy if they are sexually active with someone who is able to become pregnant since estrogen-combination hormone therapy does not always lower sperm count.​[^[53]]

Testosterone therapy may suppress ovulation but it is not considered an adequate form of contraception for TGD individuals with ovaries, even if patients are amenorrheic. In addition, there is data to indicate testosterone can cause abnormal fetal development should pregnancy occur with many of the teratogenic effects occurring during the first trimester when the patient may not be aware of the pregnancy. TGD patients with ovaries should use a method of birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy if they are sexually active with partners who may produce sperm.​[^[4]]​[^[56]] Testosterone therapy is not a contraindication to therapies containing estrogen and/or progestin and the selection of the method of contraception should be individualized to the patient. Factors to consider and address when choosing contraception for TGD individuals include potential of the method to cause gender dysphoria (e.g., as a result of side effects or administration procedures) and patient perceptions of feminizing effects of estrogen and progestin therapies.​[^[56]] See Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods and Contraception for a full discussion of contraceptive methods available.
