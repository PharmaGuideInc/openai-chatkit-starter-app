#### General Principles of Drug Use in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The management of common medical conditions during pregnancy and breastfeeding often includes self-medication. It can be a therapeutic challenge to accurately determine the efficacy and safety of management strategies in this patient population. This chapter provides an overview of the assessment and management of some common minor ailments encountered in pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Many patients are faced with the dilemma of how to best manage their medical conditions during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and few medications are officially approved for use during these times. When treating common medical conditions in a pregnant or breastfeeding patient, the risks and benefits to the patient, fetus, and nursing infant must be weighed carefully to help the patient make an informed decision about medication use. Take care to provide accurate, current and relevant information in a calm, nonalarming manner; provide the perspective that even if a patient does not take any medication during pregnancy, there is a baseline risk of 1–3% for major fetal malformations.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Table 1 and Table 2 provide some guiding principles for medication use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

|  |
| --- |
| Recommend nonpharmacologic therapy first whenever feasible. |
| Determine the gestational or infant age. Risk posed by a drug may vary by pregnancy trimester. Premature and newborn infants may be more vulnerable to drug effects. |
| Consider whether the benefits of drug therapy outweigh the risks. |
| Choose drugs with published data in pregnancy and breastfeeding over newer drugs with less information. |
| Choose the most effective agent with the most reassuring safety data in the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible duration. |
| Choose single-entity products to avoid unnecessary drug exposure. |
| Consider local application of drugs whenever possible to minimize systemic absorption. |
| Choose drugs with shorter half-lives whenever feasible to minimize medication exposure to the fetus/infant. |
| Any prolonged use of drug therapy (>3 days) should be discussed with a health-care practitioner. |
| Reassess if initial therapy for minor ailments fails to provide relief after 3 days. |
| Whenever feasible, schedule doses when the least amount of drug is anticipated to be in the breast milk (e.g., right after breastfeeding or before the baby is expected to have a long sleep period). Drug diffuses from the milk back to the vascular compartment as the plasma drug concentration falls, so that the lowest levels in milk occur just prior to the next dose. Dosing in this manner may not always be practical, particularly when breastfeeding young infants who feed frequently and sleep for only short intervals. |
| If several drugs are equally useful, select the drug that is transferred into breast milk in the lowest concentration with the least effect on the infant. |


| Myths | Facts |
| --- | --- |
| “Patients who are pregnant should not take any medications.” “Patients should stop their medications if they become pregnant.” | Although only a few medications are specifically indicated for use during pregnancy, many medications are safe for use in pregnancy.​[7]​[8] Uncontrolled medical conditions can often pose a greater risk to a fetus than the treatment medication.​[9]​[10] |
| “The fetus is only susceptible to teratogenic effects from drug therapy taken during the first 3 months of pregnancy.” | The first 3 months of gestation may be the most critical in terms of fetal structural malformations, but functional and behavioural defects are also associated with later exposure. Teratogenic agents are defined as those that are capable of producing structural or functional abnormalities in the embryo or fetus.​[11] |
| “This drug causes malformations in animals, so it should not be used in pregnancy.” | Animal data cannot always be extrapolated to human situations,​[5] e.g., erythromycin is considered a safe antibiotic to use in pregnancy, but it has been reported to cause malformations in rats,​[8] and in contrast, thalidomide was found to be safe in most animal models, but can cause limb defects in human fetuses.​[7] |
| “Due to ease of availability, it can be assumed that nonprescription drug therapies are safe to use in pregnancy and breastfeeding.” | Many nonprescription drugs require careful consideration of beneficial vs. harmful effects or have limited safety data in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.​[7]​[12] |
| “Due to ease of availability, natural health products can be considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding.” | In many cases, there is little reliable human data about the safety of natural health products during pregnancy or breastfeeding, e.g., echinacea.​[12] Certain herbs such as blue cohosh are specifically contraindicated due to empirical evidence that they can act as abortifacients and cause cardiovascular defects.​[13] As with any other medicine, one must weigh the risks and possible benefits of using natural health products during pregnancy. Some natural health products may contain undeclared drugs or contaminants. |
| “If a drug is transferred into breast milk, it is contraindicated in a breastfeeding patient.” | In many cases, only very low concentrations of drugs are present in breast milk and they are still considered safe to use in breastfeeding.​[14] In general, taking drugs during breastfeeding poses much less risk to the infant than drug therapy during pregnancy. Health-care practitioners should consult specific references to determine drug safety in breastfeeding. |


#### Prenatal Nutrition

#### Key Nutritional Recommendations in Pregnancy

Proper nutrition plays a very important role in a healthy pregnancy. Extra nutrients are required to meet the needs of the developing fetus. In addition to the key nutrients listed in Table 3, early evidence suggests that choline and omega-3 fatty acids are also important during pregnancy. Recommend incorporating foods rich in choline (e.g., eggs) and omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fatty fish, nuts, seeds, vegetable oils) into a well-balanced diet.​[^[15]]

| Nutrient | Role in Pregnancy | Daily Requirement | Nonpharmacologic Therapy | Pharmacologic Therapy | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General | Nutrient requirements are increased due to needs of the growing fetus.Recommended micronutrient requirements may not be met without vitamin and mineral supplementation.​[15] |  | Eat a well-balanced diet including a variety of nutrient-dense foods. See Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide.​[15]​[16]​[17]​[18] If patient is not getting adequate nutrition from diet, recommend dietary counselling. | Prenatal and postpartum vitamin and mineral supplementation. When selecting a multivitamin, the product should contain vitamin B12 in addition to the ingredients discussed below.​[17]​[18] | Advise patients not to increase the dose of a multivitamin or take more than 1 multivitamin as high doses of vitamin A (>10 000 units or >3000 mcg RAE/day) can cause birth defects.​[17]​[18] |
| Calcium | Supports fetal skeletal development. Adequate intake reduces the risk of hypertension and pre-eclampsia.​[19]​[20] Maintains maternal stores. | **vitamin D** | Eat foods high in calcium, e.g., dairy products and calcium-fortified juices.​[21] | Supplementation with at least 1000 mg/day is recommended for those with a dietary intake of less than 600 mg/day, e.g., less than 2 dairy servings/day.​[19]​[20] The upper limit of total daily intake is 2500 mg for those 19–50 y and 3000 mg for those <19 y.​[22] | May cause or exacerbate constipation. High rate of bone loss during pregnancy and breastfeeding; thus, adequate intake is essential for maternal bone health.​[21] Calcium-based antacids can have the dual benefits of calcium supplementation and heartburn relief.​[21] |
| Folic acid​[a] | Essential for normal development of fetal spine, brain and skull. Reduces the risk of NTDs (e.g., spina bifida, anencephaly).​[17] Neural tube development occurs early in pregnancy (during wk 3 and 4) when many people may not be aware they are pregnant.​[17] | 0.4 mgSee Comments. | Eat foods high in folic acid (e.g., fortified grains, spinach, lentils, chick peas, asparagus, broccoli, peas, Brussels sprouts, corn and oranges). Diet alone is unlikely to meet requirement.​[17] | Supplementation with 0.4 mg/day, in addition to dietary sources, is recommended for all patients with child-bearing potential. Start at least 2–3 months preconception, continuing throughout pregnancy and for 4–6 wk postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues.​[17]​[24] | People with moderate risk of NTD​[b]: 1 mg daily beginning at least 3 months prior to conception and continuing until 12 wk gestational age, followed by 0.4–1 mg daily until 4–6 wk postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues.​[24] People with high risk of NTD​[c]: 4 mg daily beginning at least 3 months prior to conception and continuing until 12 wk gestational age, followed by 0.4–1 mg daily until 4–6 wk postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues.​[24] |
| Iodine | Increased requirement as iodine is essential for fetal neurologic development and to maintain maternal metabolism.​[25]​[26] | 220–250 mcg | Eat foods with iodine, e.g., saltwater seafood, milk. A teaspoon of table salt in Canada contains 380 mcg of iodine. Kosher, pickling and sea salt contain much less iodine.​[27] Processed foods generally do not use iodized salt.​[28]​[29] | Supplementation with 150 mcg/day suggested.​[28]​[30]​[31] Avoid kelp/seaweed products as they may be contaminated with heavy metals.​[28]​[33] | Sustained iodine intake >500–1100 mcg/day should be avoided due to the potential for fetal hypothyroidism.​[30]Avoid fish with higher levels of methylmercury.​[15] See Government of Canada: Mercury in Fish.​[34] |
| Iron | Supports normal fetal brain development and builds fetal iron stores in the third trimester. Lowers risk of maternal anemia.​[35] | 27 mg | Eat foods high in heme iron, e.g., meat, poultry and fish. Eat nonheme iron sources (e.g., fortified food, tofu, lentils, beans) with vitamin C–containing foods. Diet alone is unlikely to meet requirement.​[18] | Supplementation with 16–20 mg/day is recommended.​[15]​[18] | May exacerbate constipation, nausea and vomiting; consider temporary discontinuation in the first trimester​[36] or intermittent dosing (e.g., 120 mg once weekly) in those who are not anemic.​[37] |

#### Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy

#### Pathophysiology

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is very common, occurring in about 70% of people who are pregnant. Approximately one-third of people who are pregnant will experience nausea without vomiting.​[^[38]] Despite popular use of the term “morning sickness,” NVP persists throughout the day in the majority of cases.​[^[39]] NVP usually appears by 4–6 weeks’ gestation and disappears by 12–16 weeks; however, it can persist throughout pregnancy in up to 20% of cases.​[^[1]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] The nausea and/or vomiting is usually self-limiting and not associated with any adverse fetal outcome.​[^[42]] Severe vomiting resulting in significant maternal weight loss may increase the risk of low birth weight babies.​[^[42]]​[^[43]] Even less severe NVP can negatively affect a person’s daily life. It can cause emotional, social and economic problems for the patient and their family.​[^[1]]​[^[44]]

Although it occurs rarely, severe NVP, or hyperemesis gravidarum, may lead to dehydration, malnutrition and weight loss, requiring hospitalization.​[^[1]] Hyperemesis gravidarum affects on average 1% of pregnancies and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.​[^[38]]​[^[42]] Onset is nearly always in the first trimester, usually between weeks 6 and 8.​[^[43]] Hyperemesis gravidarum may persist throughout the pregnancy, but usually becomes less extreme as the pregnancy progresses. It tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies, making the diagnosis more likely with a previous history.​[^[42]]

The etiology of NVP is unknown, but it is postulated that multiple factors are involved. Hormonal changes, specifically first-trimester elevations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone and/or estradiol have been implicated. Other proposed causes or contributors include slower gastric emptying, Helicobacter pylori infection, psychological predisposition, genetic predisposition, carrying a female fetus and evolutionary adaptation.​[^[1]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] NVP is associated with a lower rate of miscarriage, which is likely a consequence of robust hormone synthesis in a healthy pregnancy rather than a protective effect of vomiting.​[^[42]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Abdominal pain or tenderness (other than mild epigastric tenderness after retching), fever and headache suggest a cause other than NVP such as gastroenteritis, peptic ulcer, appendicitis, pyelonephritis or hyperthyroidism.​[^[42]]​[^[46]] Onset of nausea and vomiting after week 9 of gestation should also be assessed for a secondary cause.

Patients with more severe nausea and vomiting with signs of dehydration or weight loss must be assessed immediately by a health-care practitioner. The Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE-24) is a validated and easy-to-use scoring system that can assess severity and response to treatment.​[^[47]]​[^[48]] Information on NVP can also be found in Nausea and Vomiting.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Counsel patients with adequate hydration and nutrition despite NVP on nonpharmacologic measures to relieve symptoms. People who are pregnant can take many measures to alleviate NVP. Avoiding potentially aggravating factors such as certain smells, fried or spicy food, an empty stomach, stress and fatigue can be helpful for some. Taking prenatal multivitamins and/or iron supplements after meals or at bedtime is also suggested.​[^[45]] If the size of the prenatal multivitamin or its iron content is an aggravating factor, consider temporarily stopping the multivitamin, switching to a chewable multivitamin, or switching to multivitamin with no iron or a lower iron content.​[^[36]]​[^[42]]​[^[48]] Intermittent iron supplementation (e.g., once weekly) may also be considered in people who are pregnant and who are not anemic​[^[37]] (see Table 3). It is important to maintain the recommended intake of folic acid; a folic acid supplement may be needed if the prenatal multivitamin is changed or temporarily discontinued. Detailed information for patients on management of morning sickness is found in Morning Sickness—What You Need to Know.

Acupressure at the Nei Guan or P6 point, located 3 finger-widths up from the wrist crease, by use of wrist bands (e.g., Seabands) has been used in the management of nausea and vomiting and appears to be safe in pregnancy.​[^[40]]​[^[49]] This method has shown varying degrees of effectiveness and may be useful for mild symptoms.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] A single, short-term study found comparable efficacy to pyridoxine for mild to moderate symptoms.​[^[49]]

Limited data suggest mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (as an adjuvant to pyridoxine) may improve NVP symptoms.​[^[50]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Antiemetics are indicated for the treatment of moderate NVP that fails to respond to nonpharmacologic interventions (see Table 8).

The therapies of choice in the management of NVP that are unresponsive to nonpharmacologic measures are pyridoxine alone or in combination with the first-generation antihistamine doxylamine.​[^[42]]​[^[48]]

Pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, has been used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting since 1942.​[^[48]] Several RCTs of varying quality have shown pyridoxine to be beneficial for mild to moderate NVP.​[^[42]]​[^[48]]​[^[63]] Although case reports sparked concern that taking pyridoxine during pregnancy might cause seizures in some newborns, further investigation suggests the infants had an underlying vitamin B6 deficiency disorder that was unmasked when maternal supplementation was stopped.​[^[61]]

A combination delayed-release product containing pyridoxine and doxylamine (Diclectin) has been used in Canada for NVP since 1957.​[^[64]] Its place in therapy and its safety have been questioned in recent years due to reanalysis of the original trial data, in which no clinically important benefit over placebo was noted for those with mild-moderate symptoms.​[^[65]]​[^[66]]​[^[67]]​[^[68]] A Health Canada review concluded that no changes in the information pertaining to the safety of this combination product during pregnancy were indicated and that its benefits continued to outweigh any risks.​[^[64]] Canadian and American guidelines recommend the pyridoxine/doxylamine combination product as a first-line option.​[^[42]]​[^[48]] It is the only product with a Health Canada–approved indication for NVP. Over 33 million pregnant patients worldwide have taken delayed-release doxylamine with pyridoxine and it has not been found to increase the risk of major malformations.​[^[2]] Patients should be informed that despite its safety, doxylamine/pyridoxine may not be effective and to keep in mind that symptoms usually resolve on their own.

Dimenhydrinate is a second-line treatment option but may be preferred when oral drug administration is not possible.​[^[1]]​[^[42]]​[^[51]] If the patient is vomiting frequently, it can be given orally or rectally 30 or 45 minutes before a dose of pyridoxine ± doxylamine.​[^[1]]​[^[44]] 

Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) traditionally has been used in many forms (e.g., ginger tea, ginger ale, gingersnaps, powdered ginger root) to alleviate nausea. Powdered ginger root is the form of ginger most commonly used in studies. Small randomized, controlled trials indicate ginger reduces NVP and its efficacy is at least comparable to that of dimenhydrinate and pyridoxine.​[^[39]]​[^[63]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[59]]​[^[69]] However, replicating this effect in practice is hindered by the lack of description of the composition of ginger used and lack of standardization of many ginger products.​[^[70]] The usual dose is up to 1000 mg per day.​[^[44]] Licensed natural health ginger products are available (e.g., Gravol Ginger). Ginger does not appear to be teratogenic and is generally considered safe during pregnancy.​[^[48]] However, there are limited data on fetal effects with ginger supplementation.​[^[71]]​[^[32]]​[^[72]]

Information regarding efficacy and safety is lacking for other traditional remedies such as peppermint, raspberry leaf and chamomile.

Other agents that are used in the treatment of NVP include metoclopramide, ondansetron, phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine, promethazine, prochlorperazine) and methylprednisolone. These agents are used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy after inadequate response to first-line pharmacologic agents.​[^[42]]​[^[48]]​[^[63]] Metoclopramide and phenothiazines are not teratogenic but can cause extrapyramidal effects in the patient, and in the newborn if given near term. Safety data for ondansetron are conflicting. Due to its potential to cause QT prolongation, cleft palate and fetal heart defects, use should be limited to after 10 weeks' gestation if possible. Similarly, methylprednisolone use should be delayed until after 10 weeks' gestation due to possible association with cleft palate.​[^[44]]​[^[48]]

#### Allergic Rhinitis during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Pathophysiology

Rhinitis affects at least 20% of pregnancies.​[^[73]] Common symptoms of allergic rhinitis include nasal itchiness; clear, watery rhinorrhea; and sneezing.​[^[73]] Hormonal changes in pregnancy can worsen nasal symptoms and can induce a form of rhinitis, termed “rhinitis of pregnancy,” which presents as congestion and occurs in the absence of other signs of respiratory tract infection or a known allergic cause. Rhinitis of pregnancy occurs in approximately 9% of pregnancies and usually begins later in the pregnancy but can start at any time, with resolution of the syndrome within 1–2 weeks postpartum.​[^[74]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]]​[^[77]] More information can be found in Allergic Rhinitis.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

The mainstay of nonpharmacologic management of allergic rhinitis during pregnancy is minimizing exposure to allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites or mould growth, and remaining indoors when necessary. Avoiding exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke, smog and strong odours is also important. For both allergic- and pregnancy-induced rhinitis, nocturnal congestion may be temporarily relieved by elevating the head of the bed and/or use of external nasal dilators (e.g., Breathe Right nasal strips).​[^[77]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Cough, Cold and Allergy Products.

Therapies for allergic rhinitis and the common cold are outlined in Table 9.

Due to its local application and lack of toxicity, irrigation via **nasal** saline sprays, mists or washes is a recommended sole or adjuvant therapy in providing symptom control to irritated nasal passages during pregnancy.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]]​[^[117]]

Antihistamines are first-line agents in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.​[^[76]] During pregnancy, **first-generation antihistamines** are considered safe; chlorpheniramine is considered an agent of choice for allergic rhinitis.​[^[3]]​[^[74]]​[^[83]] Caution is advised with usual or high-dose first-generation antihistamine therapy near the end of term due to the potential for withdrawal effects in the newborn and retinopathy of prematurity, particularly in low-birth-weight newborns.​[^[74]] The second-generation antihistamines loratadine, desloratadine and **cetirizine** are also considered safe during pregnancy; fexofenadine can be considered as an alternative (due to less available safety data).​[^[77]]​[^[83]]​[^[87]]​[^[118]]​[^[119]]​[^[120]]​[^[121]] First- or second-generation antihistamines may be used safely during breastfeeding.​[^[83]]​[^[122]]​[^[123]]​[^[124]]​[^[125]] Second-generation antihistamines are sometimes preferred during breastfeeding due to their lower potential to cause adverse effects in the infant, reduced milk production, sedation or anticholinergic effects compared with first-generation antihistamines.​[^[79]]

Decongestants can be utilized supplementally for additional symptom relief, if nasal saline fails. Systemic pseudoephedrine is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy; however, first-trimester use may cause a small increased risk of abdominal wall and intestinal defects in the fetus.​[^[12]]​[^[82]]​[^[109]]​[^[111]] Phenylephrine is more likely than pseudoephedrine to have vasoactive effects, such as hypertension and reduced uterine blood flow (though not reported in humans), and is reserved as an alternative to pseudoephedrine.​[^[108]]​[^[109]]​[^[110]]​[^[126]]​[^[127]]​[^[128]] First-trimester use of phenylephrine has been associated with congenital defects (mostly minor), but further data are required.​[^[109]]​[^[110]] Although **topical decongestants** have lower systemic absorption, evidence is limited regarding use during pregnancy.​[^[12]]​[^[82]]​[^[109]]​[^[115]]​[^[129]]​[^[130]] First-trimester use of decongestants should be avoided if possible.​[^[77]]​[^[109]]​[^[111]]

Intranasal  corticosteroids are reserved for allergic rhinitis symptoms unresponsive to antihistamines and/or decongestants.​[^[76]] Information regarding the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in rhinitis of pregnancy is limited to a single study where no benefit was found.​[^[77]]​[^[131]] Inhaled  corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of asthma during pregnancy, particularly beclomethasone, budesonide and fluticasone.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[87]] Systemic absorption is minimal; more safety information is available for inhaled/intranasal budesonide.​[^[74]]​[^[87]]​[^[132]] The majority of data indicate no association with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities with low to moderate doses;​[^[133]] however, a small associated risk may exist between intranasal budesonide and cardiac defects, and between inhaled budesonide and orofacial clefts.​[^[101]] Minimize exposure when feasible, particularly during the first trimester.​[^[101]] Data are limited on the safety of intranasal corticosteroids during breastfeeding. They may be transferred into breast milk in small quantities; however, it is unlikely to be clinically significant and they are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[6]]​[^[79]]​[^[101]]

The antileukotriene montelukast has been used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis after other treatments have failed. Harmful effects have not been seen in animal studies but human pregnancy data are limited and use should be limited to cases where the benefit clearly outweighs risk.​[^[74]] No adverse effects are expected in infants exposed to montelukast via breastfeeding as only small amounts are transferred into breastmilk​[^[134]] and montelukast is used therapeutically in infants.​[^[79]]​[^[135]]

**Allergen** immunotherapy can be continued during pregnancy. However, to reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction, it should not be initiated during pregnancy nor should the strength of the allergen be increased.​[^[74]]​[^[87]] No data are available for safety in breastfeeding; however, it is unlikely to pass into breast milk, and it is considered safe to continue breastfeeding while on allergen immunotherapy.​[^[6]]

#### Other Common Conditions in Pregnancy

#### Other Common Conditions in Pregnancy

Table 4 describes the management of some conditions commonly encountered in pregnancy. Many conditions are covered in detail in specific chapters as outlined in the endnotes (see also Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions). Information regarding therapy for depression in pregnancy is discussed in conjunction with therapy of postpartum depression (see Pharmacologic Therapy in Postpartum Depression section).

| Condition | Cause | Nonpharmacologic Therapy | Pharmacologic Therapy​[a] | Monitoring of Therapy | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backache​[b],Headache​[c], Pelvic pain | Back muscles under strain due to growing abdomen. Weight of uterus can contribute. Headache commonly results from muscle tension.​[136] | Backache, pelvic pain: Relaxation exercises; massage; rest in recumbent position; good posture and lifting techniques; moderate exercise (land- or water-based); pelvic tilts; elevation of 1 leg while standing; acupuncture.​[136]​[137]Headache: Cool, wet cloth to forehead.​[136] | **codeine** | Reassess if symptoms are severe or do not improve after 5 days.With codeine, monitor patient for adverse effects such as constipation or drowsiness and reassess if adverse effects are intolerable. | **ASA** |
| Common Cold​[d] | Viral. | Bedrest; maintain fluid intake; humidify air; hard candy for a sore throat; saltwater gargle.​[12] | Many products contain more than 1 ingredient. Use single-ingredient products where possible to minimize exposure to unnecessary drugs. Avoid alcohol-containing products. | Reassess if symptoms are associated with fever, nausea or vomiting. | **zinc** |
| Constipation​[e] | Reduced GI motility due to increased progesterone levels. Other factors: compression of intestines by enlarging uterus, increased water reabsorption by colon, iron and calcium supplementation, and reduced physical activity. Occurs in 10–40% of pregnancies.​[142]​[143] Can exacerbate nausea. | Dietary: Eat foods high in fibre, e.g., whole grains, vegetables, fruits, high-fibre cereals. Add fibre to diet slowly to prevent bloating and gas.​[142]​[143] The suggested adequate fibre intake during pregnancy is 28 g/day.​[144] Increase fluid intake, e.g., 6–8 glasses of water daily.​[142]​[143]​[145]Lifestyle: Regular moderate exercise.​[142]​[143]​[145] | **psyllium** | Reassess if symptoms do not improve after 5–7 days. | **mineral oil** |
| Hemorrhoids​[f] | Increased venous pressure below the uterus; constipation and associated chronic straining; vessel walls relaxed by progesterone (can lead to swelling).​[143]​[148] Occurs in 25–35% of pregnancies.​[148] | Dietary: Prevent constipation and straining, e.g., increase dietary fibre and fluids. Lifestyle: Maintain normal bowel function. Apply ice pack or cold compress to help relieve itching. Keep anal area clean by cleaning with soap and water after each bowel movement and drying area by dabbing (not wiping) to avoid irritation. Use a warm water sitz bath for 10–15 min or soak in a warm water bath as needed for comfort. Sit on an air doughnut to relieve discomfort from pressure.​[143]​[148] | **psyllium** | Monitor for allergic reactions, which for topical rectal products may resemble hemorrhoid symptoms. Topical astringents can sting and exacerbate symptoms.​[147] Reassess if symptoms do not improve after 5–7 days. | **hydrocortisone** |
| Pigmentary changes (melasma, chloasma, mask of pregnancy) | Cause of this facial skin hyperpigmentation disorder is unknown. Risk factors include darker skin types, genetic disposition, exposure to UV light, pregnancy, oral hormonal contraceptives and underlying thyroid disorders.​[151] | Can be initiated and exacerbated by sun exposure. Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight.​[151] | **hydroquinone** | Monitor for skin redness, burning, irritation, unusual skin discoloration. | Usually resolves after pregnancy. However, up to 30% of cases may be persistent.​[155]May reoccur and darken with subsequent pregnancies.​[156] |
| Reflux Esophagitis​[g] | Decreased pressure or blunted response of the lower esophageal sphincter caused by hormonal changes. Other factors likely contribute. Usually first reported in early pregnancy.​[157] Predominant symptoms are heartburn and regurgitation, which are aggravated by meals and lying down.​[142] Occurs in 30–80% of cases.​[143] | Dietary: Eat small, frequent meals; eat slowly; avoid foods that cause heartburn; eat in an upright position; drink warm milk; avoid oral intake (other than water) within 3 h of going to bed. Lifestyle: Elevate the head of the bed using blocks or use 2 extra pillows to raise the head; lay on the left side of the body; avoid stooping, bending or assuming other positions that tend to worsen reflux; chew gum.​[136]​[142]​[143]​[157] | **antacids** | Monitor for heartburn, regurgitation and nausea as well as other signs and symptoms of heartburn. Reassess if symptoms do not improve after 7 days and/or if a H2 receptor antagonist is required. | **ASA** |
| Stretch Marks (Striae gravidarum) | Cause of these asymptomatic, raised, red streaks on abdomen, breasts and thighs in 50–90% of people who are pregnant is unknown but may be due to weight gain and adrenal cortisol levels. Risk factors: younger age; positive family history; greater prepregnancy weight, abdominal circumference, maternal weight gain or birthweight.​[163]​[164]​[165] | No evidence of effectiveness of any nonpharmacologic therapy to prevent or treat striae gravidarum.​[164]​[165] | No good-quality evidence of effectiveness for any pharmacologic therapy for prevention or treatment of striae gravidarum including topical products containing: Alphastria, cocoa butter, olive oil, Trofolastin or Verum.​[164]​[165] | Striae are initially raised and red/purple but fade and recede, becoming depressed and pale over time. They are harmless and painless but the appearance can be bothersome to patients. |  |

#### Vaccinations during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Vaccinations during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Immunization during pregnancy or breastfeeding can provide the dual benefit of protecting the patient and the fetus/newborn by eliminating the patient as a source of disease transmission as well as transmitting protective levels of maternal antibodies transplacentally or via breast milk. Inactivated or toxoid vaccines can be given to pregnant patients when indicated. However, live vaccines (e.g., measles/mumps/rubella, varicella) are generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to the theoretical risk of transmitting the disease to the fetus. Most vaccines can be given to breastfeeding patients with the exception of those vaccines that may pose a risk of transmitting the disease to the infant (e.g., Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, smallpox vaccine, yellow fever vaccine).​[^[166]] More information on the use of selected vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 5.

| Vaccine | Use during Pregnancy | Use during Breastfeeding | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hepatitis A | Recommended when indicated (e.g., close contact with a person with hepatitis A, travel to an endemic area).​[167] |  |  |
| Hepatitis B | Recommended when indicated (e.g., ongoing exposure risk).​[168] |  |  |
| Human papillomavirus | Not recommended due to limited information in pregnancy.​[169]​[170] Report exposure to the vaccine manufacturer. Available data suggest no significant increase in negative outcomes.​[171] | May use if indicated.​[169] |  |
| Influenza (inactivated) | Recommended in all patients at any stage of pregnancy.Associated with reduced maternal and newborn influenza-related morbidity and reduced adverse neonatal outcomes.​[166]The risk of influenza-related hospitalization increases with gestation.​[172] | Recommended in all patients.​[166]​[172] | Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be used during breastfeeding when indicated.​[166]​[172] |
| Meningococcal conjugate | Recommended when indicated (e.g., travel to a high-risk area, postexposure prophylaxis, during an outbreak).​[173] |  |  |
| Pertussis (acellular) | Recommended in every pregnancy between 27 and 32 weeks’ gestation irrespective of previous pertussis immunization history. Due to varying cycle activity of pertussis, routine immunization is preferred over outbreak intervention only. May be given from 13–26 weeks gestation in some situations.​[174] | Recommended to be given as early as possible postpartum if pertussis vaccine not previously received in adulthood.​[174] | Available only as a combination vaccine (Tdap recommended). The greatest morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in children <6 months.​[174] |
| Pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate | Recommended when indicated (e.g., those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes mellitus).​[175] |  |  |
| Tetanus toxoid | Recommended when indicated (postexposure prophylaxis).​[176] |  |  |

#### Use of Common Substances/Products during Pregnancy

#### Use of Common Substances/Products during Pregnancy

Information on the use of some common substances/products during pregnancy can be found in Table 6. In the case of people with substance use disorders, nonjudgmental dialogue is needed to help them achieve abstinence or harm reduction.​[^[177]]​[^[178]]

| Substance/Product | Recommendation in Pregnancy | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alcohol | Avoid use.​[177] | Regular use of alcohol, or exposure to high levels of alcohol, can cause fetal harm (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder). The amount of exposure required to cause harm is unclear; therefore, abstinence is recommended.​[177]​[179] |
| Caffeine | Consume ≤300 mg/day.​[179]​[180] | The half-life of caffeine increases from approximately 3 h pre-pregnancy to 10.5 h in the third trimester.​[181] High intake can potentially result in low birthweight or pregnancy loss.​[180]​[182]​[183]​[184]​[185]​[186] Average amounts of caffeine in common drinks and foods can be found on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website.​[179] |
| Cannabis | Avoid use.​[178] | Data is limited but suggests possible harm. Maternal anemia as well as low birth weight, neurocognitive deficits (e.g., impaired memory and verbal skills) and behavioural deficits (e.g., aggressiveness, hyperactivity, inattention) in the child have been associated with prenatal exposure.​[178]​[187]​[188] |
| Cigarette smoking | Avoid use and exposure to second-hand smoke.​[178] | Associated with a number of negative effects (e.g., spontaneous abortion, preterm labour, small for gestational age, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood respiratory problems).If cessation is unsuccessful after education and behavioural therapy, use of smoking cessation medications should be considered.​[189]​[190]​[191] The safety of electronic cigarettes (vaping) is unknown. Avoid use.​[177]Prevention of Gestational and Neonatal Exposure to Tobacco Smoke (PREGNETS) website (www.pregnets.org) provides information and support for those trying to quit smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding.See also Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation. |
| Hair treatments (e.g., bleaching, colouring, straightening) | Occasional hair treatments unlikely to pose a risk. | Limited human data are available. Based on animal data, minimal systemic absorption and lack of reports of fetal harm, having hair treatments 3–4 times during pregnancy at 6- to 8-wk intervals is unlikely to pose a risk to the fetus.​[192]​[193] |


#### Postpartum Perineal Care and Postepisiotomy Pain

#### Pathophysiology

The perineum is a diamond-shaped area between the vagina and the anus.​[^[194]] A Canadian study found 92% of individuals who had a vaginal delivery experienced perineal pain on the first day postpartum. A week later, 61% reported pain and by 6 weeks postpartum, only 7% reported perineal pain.​[^[195]] Perineal pain results from trauma to the area as a result of bruising, tearing, episiotomies (enlargement of the vaginal orifice by surgical cutting of the perineum to facilitate delivery) and/or use of a vacuum or forceps to assist delivery.​[^[194]]​[^[196]] The perineum is an extremely tender site for a cut or stitches, which causes a wide range of pain, from mild to excruciating.​[^[195]] Perineal pain can cause reduced mobility, discomfort during urination or defecation, urinary and fecal incontinence, discomfort while sitting, and sexual dysfunction, and can interfere with providing newborn care.​[^[197]]​[^[198]] The degree and duration of pain are related to the intensity of the trauma. Those who had episiotomies and more extensive tearing (third- or fourth-degree tears), reported perineal pain at 6 weeks at a rate of 13% and 20% respectively.​[^[195]] In contrast, pain resolved within 2.5 weeks for those with an intact perineum or minor tears.​[^[199]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

When perineal pain is severe or associated with foul-smelling discharge, burning, bleeding or high fever, the patient should be assessed by an appropriate health-care practitioner immediately.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic measures to relieve symptoms and help with perineal healing include localized cooling,​[^[197]]​[^[200]] Kegel exercises and rinsing the area with warm water from a perineal squirt bottle after using the toilet. Detailed information for patients on perineum care can be found in Care of the Vaginal Area (Perineum) after Childbirth—What You Need to Know.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Care Products: Anesthetics.

Short-term relief of perineal pain can be obtained using a local agent (see Table 10). Wipes containing hamamelis (witch hazel) may reduce pain and itching.​[^[199]] Topical anesthetic products containing lidocaine are also available but should be used only under the direction of a health-care practitioner due to the risk of systemic absorption from the area of trauma. The efficacy of topical anesthetics for perineum pain is unclear due to lack of evidence.​[^[206]] Nonmedicated cream or hydrocortisone 1% cream applied to the area were equally effective for reducing perineal pain compared to no cream application in a small RCT.​[^[207]]

Nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen **sodium** are first-line oral medications for perineal pain in breastfeeding patients.​[^[208]]​[^[209]] NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen sodium) may provide similar efficacy to codeine/acetaminophen products and do not cause constipation.​[^[209]] Opioid analgesics such as codeine were initially considered compatible with breastfeeding; however, depending on ethnicity, 1–29% of the population are ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6, which results in increased conversion of codeine to morphine.​[^[94]]​[^[95]]​[^[210]] A case report in 2006 of an infant death related to ultrarapid metabolism of codeine by the breastfeeding patient sparked concern regarding the safety of codeine use.​[^[210]] If a codeine product is deemed necessary, use the lowest effective dose and limit use to a maximum of 4 days if possible. Closely monitor patient and infant for signs of opioid toxicity, e.g., sedation, lethargy and poor milk intake by infant.​[^[94]]​[^[211]]

#### Postpartum Depression

#### Pathophysiology

Postpartum blues (“baby blues”) is common, occurring in 15–85% of people who are postpartum.​[^[212]] Symptoms generally begin sometime in the first week after delivery and may include sadness, insomnia, tearfulness, irritability, fatigue, anxiety and poor appetite. Postpartum blues has only a minimal effect on the person's ability to function and is transient, resolving spontaneously within 1–2 weeks.​[^[212]]​[^[213]] The cause is unknown, although hormonal changes after delivery are believed to play a role. Postpartum blues usually does not require therapy due to its transient course.

Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in approximately 13% of people who have given birth.​[^[214]] In contrast to the baby blues, PPD is more disabling with patients often finding it difficult to take care of the infant and themselves. PPD is also more persistent, lasting longer than 2 weeks. The incidence is highest in the first 3 months postpartum with peak onset in the first 4–6 weeks, but may occur anytime in the first 6 months after delivery. The symptoms are the same as for major depressive disorder and can include lowered energy, difficulty concentrating, severe anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, disturbed sleep and changes in appetite. Maternal attitudes toward the infant are highly variable but can include disinterest, fear of being alone with the infant or excessive intrusiveness that inhibits adequate infant rest.​[^[215]] Thoughts of self-harm or suicide can also be present. The etiology may be complex and include biologic and psychosocial factors.​[^[212]]​[^[213]]

PPD may result in the patient feeling too unwell to initiate or maintain breastfeeding. Untreated PPD can also result in impaired child development and is associated with poor cognitive functioning, behavioural inhibition and emotional maladjustment in infants and children.​[^[212]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Patients in the postpartum stage should be monitored carefully by their health-care practitioners. The diagnosis may be difficult to make since changes in sleep, appetite and energy are routine with the arrival of a new baby. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a validated and readily available screening tool consisting of 10 multiple choice questions to be answered by the new patient.​[^[212]]​[^[213]] A brief patient information sheet with a checklist is provided in Postpartum Depression—What You Need to Know. If any of the signs on the checklist apply to a postpartum patient, strongly advise them to seek help by immediately referring them for counselling and/or specialized mental health treatment, and encourage completion of the more specific Edinburgh scale.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Psychotherapy may be effective for some people suffering from PPD. Specifically, supportive counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy and psychodynamic therapy have shown benefit.​[^[214]] However, psychotherapy may not be an option for all due to cost, lack of a therapist in the area and difficulty arranging child care to attend sessions.​[^[212]] Some people may receive benefit from light therapy, peer support groups and/or regular exercise.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Herbal and Natural Health Products: Single Entity; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

St. John's wort has been used in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Information in breastfeeding is conflicting ranging from reports of no adverse effects in infants to reports of jaundice, colic, drowsiness and lethargy.​[^[6]]​[^[216]]​[^[217]] St. John's wort can interact with many other medications as it induces CYP3A4, including reducing the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.​[^[216]] Due to the variability in composition of products and potential for drug interactions, other treatment options are preferred. Use during pregnancy should be avoided as there are insufficient human or animal data.​[^[217]]​[^[218]]

**Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation** has been investigated for treating depression. Randomized controlled trials have not shown a benefit over placebo in postpartum patients; however, studies have been limited by small sample size and variation in the dose of omega-3 used.​[^[212]]​[^[218]] Although omega-3 supplementation cannot presently be recommended for perinatal depression, patients should be encouraged to meet dietary intake requirements to aid in normal fetal and infant development.

The safety and efficacy of ***S*-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe)** for treating postpartum depression and depression during pregnancy have not been established; its use should be avoided.​[^[218]]​[^[219]] Folic acid has been found to augment antidepressant efficacy, but has not been specifically studied in perinatal depression; doses beyond routine supplementation cannot be recommended (see Table 3).​[^[218]]

Patients who are breastfeeding may prefer psychotherapy over medication; however, it may be less effective than medication for severe depressive symptoms. Antidepressants pass into breast milk but usually do not produce adverse effects in the infant. Monitor the infant for irritability, sedation, poor weight gain and change in feeding patterns.​[^[212]] The choice of antidepressant should be based on the patient’s symptoms and history of antidepressant use. Treat for a minimum of 9 months.​[^[213]]

#### Postpartum Contraception

#### Introduction

Most health-care practitioners suggest waiting about 4–6 weeks before resuming vaginal intercourse, to allow the body to heal. The uterus and vagina must return to their prepregnancy size, a process that usually occurs more quickly in those who are breastfeeding.

Many variables such as fatigue, postpartum depression and decreased sex drive can influence this time frame. For some, it may take much longer before they feel like resuming vaginal intercourse; however, surveys indicate a significant number choose to resume before 6 weeks.​[^[220]] Individuals need to make the decision based on their own comfort level.

Ovulation usually resumes within 4 weeks after delivery in nonlactating people. In those who are breastfeeding, the onset of ovulation is delayed but more variable as it is influenced by the extent of breastfeeding.​[^[220]]

The choice of contraceptive method is highly individual. Discussion of the pros and cons of various methods should begin during the last trimester of pregnancy to provide sufficient time to make an informed choice. Contraception should be initiated in the third postpartum week.​[^[220]]​[^[221]] Some long-term contraceptive methods should not be started before 6 weeks postpartum; other options (e.g., barrier methods, progestin-only contraceptives) may need to be used in the interim (see Other Nonhormonal Methods and Hormonal Contraceptives).

#### Lactational Amenorrhea Method

The lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) uses breastfeeding as a contraceptive method. LAM can be as effective as oral contraceptives; however, it is influenced by a number of factors that may make it impractical. For LAM to be effective, the person must breastfeed at regular intervals (no greater than every 4 hours during the day or 6 hours at night) and must exclusively breastfeed (supplemental food should be no greater than 5–10% of total feedings).​[^[222]] Expressing milk by pump is less vigorous than suckling and may reduce the efficacy of LAM. Even with full breastfeeding and adequate milk production, frequent suckling is believed to be necessary to achieve the full contraceptive effect of LAM.​[^[223]] After 6 months or when menstruation resumes, the risk of ovulation increases and thus the efficacy of LAM declines.​[^[222]] Some suggest an additional form of contraception be started in the third postpartum month.​[^[220]]

#### Other Nonhormonal Methods

Barrier methods include external and internal condoms, sponges, diaphragms and cervical caps, all supplemented by spermicides. External condoms can be used almost immediately postpartum and can be a good short-term option for those waiting for initiation of a more long-term method. Lubricated condoms can help offset vaginal dryness experienced by some people who are postpartum.​[^[221]] 

Diaphragm and cervical cap fitting or refitting should be performed 6–8 weeks after delivery, to allow for completion of uterine involution.​[^[220]] The sponge may have a higher failure rate among those who have delivered a baby than among those who have not, even with perfect use.​[^[221]]​[^[224]] To decrease the risk of toxic shock syndrome, contraceptive sponges, cervical caps and diaphragms should not be used while there is continued postpartum bleeding.​[^[220]]​[^[221]] The lower effectiveness of barrier methods compared with intrauterine and hormonal options should be considered when choosing a method.​[^[225]]

A copper intrauterine device (IUD) can be inserted immediately (within 10 min) after delivery of the placenta or in the early postpartum period (between 10 min and 48 h postpartum).​[^[226]]​[^[227]]​[^[228]] If this window is missed, wait until >4 weeks postpartum (due to risk of expulsion).​[^[227]]​[^[228]] The disadvantages of immediate/early postpartum insertion are a higher expulsion rate (approximately 4–11%)​[^[229]]​[^[230]] and potentially a small increased risk of uterine perforation (since both IUD insertion while breastfeeding and IUD insertion when <36 wk postpartum can increase risk).​[^[231]] Despite these risks, the benefits of immediate/early postpartum insertion (i.e., initiation of reliable and effective contraception) are considered to outweigh risks.​[^[226]]​[^[227]]​[^[228]] Copper IUDs have no known effect on lactation.​[^[220]]​[^[221]]​[^[225]] 

For more information on barrier contraceptive devices, see Contraception: Natural Family Planning and Barrier Methods.

#### Hormonal Contraceptives

For more information on hormonal therapy, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Contraception

Postpartum use of combination **estrogen-progestin contraceptives** is restricted due to increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and possible negative effects on breastfeeding.​[^[232]] However, after 6 weeks postpartum, an estrogen-progestin contraceptive can be initiated.​[^[222]]​[^[232]]

The risk of VTE postpartum is estimated to be 22- to 84-fold greater than that of nonpregnant, nonpostpartum people.​[^[233]] This risk steadily declines postpartum, and within 6 weeks most people have returned to their pre-pregnancy risk.​[^[220]]​[^[233]] As estrogen-progestin contraceptives independently increase risk of VTE, it is recommended to delay their initiation until more than 6 weeks postpartum.​[^[222]]​[^[232]] Earlier use (>3 wk postpartum) may be considered in those who are considered low risk.​[^[232]]

Whether to initiate combined estrogen-containing contraceptives in those who are breastfeeding is an area of controversy. Estrogen has the potential to reduce lactation; however, studies in this area are generally of poor quality and data are lacking with the low-dose estrogen products.​[^[221]]​[^[234]] It is recommended to wait at least until breastfeeding is well established (at least 4–6 weeks postpartum).​[^[221]]​[^[222]]​[^[232]] 

**Progestin-only contraceptives** (oral progestin, medroxyprogesterone depot injection and levonorgestrel [LNG] intrauterine device) are generally initiated 4–6 weeks postpartum in breastfeeding patients. This time frame is based on the paucity of high-quality data for earlier use and the theoretical concern that neonates are unable to effectively metabolize progestins in breast milk.​[^[221]]​[^[222]]​[^[232]]​[^[235]] However, due to the lack of evidence of negative effects on breastfeeding or infant growth and development, guidelines indicate use of progestin-only contraceptives can be considered any time postpartum.​[^[232]]​[^[235]]​[^[236]]​[^[237]]​[^[238]] There may be a small increased risk of uterine perforation if IUD insertion occurs while breastfeeding or when <36 weeks postpartum;​[^[231]] however, similar to copper IUDs, a hormonal IUD can be inserted immediately after delivery of the placenta (within 10 min) or in the early postpartum period (10 min to 48 h postpartum).​[^[226]]​[^[227]]​[^[228]] LNG IUD expulsion rates may be higher (17–38%).​[^[229]]​[^[230]]

#### Drug Therapy during Breastfeeding

#### Drug Therapy during Breastfeeding

Nearly all drugs will be present in breast milk to some degree following maternal ingestion.​[^[6]] Many lists of drugs that are acceptable to ingest during breastfeeding have been developed, but they differ and are based on subjective interpretation of data. Most of the published data come from single case reports, and reports of drug concentration in breast milk are often based on single dose measurements, not accounting for effects of drug accumulation.​[^[11]] Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of this information. Additionally, a drug's effect on milk production is an important consideration. Refer to Table 1 for general principles of drug therapy during breastfeeding.

Table 7 outlines some information pertaining to common medication use during breastfeeding. See also Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions.

#### Suppression of Lactation

#### Introduction

For people who are unable to breastfeed or choose not to, suppression of lactation may be desired. Without suckling stimulation, lactation will gradually cease. However, some people may experience leakage, engorgement and/or pain before lactation ends.​[^[243]] These symptoms begin 1–4 days postpartum and peak by day 3–5, with some still experiencing pain at day 14.​[^[244]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Despite lack of evidence, the following nonpharmacologic methods are routinely used to reduce the discomfort associated with lactation suppression:





#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Nonprescription analgesics are used to reduce pain.​[^[243]] In 1988, the U.S. FDA recommended against the routine use of pharmacologic therapies (other than analgesics) for lactation suppression.​[^[244]] Bromocriptine and estrogen are not recommended due to lack of evidence of efficacy and safety concerns including risk of seizures, MI or severe hypotension with bromocriptine,​[^[246]]​[^[247]] and venous thromboembolism with estrogens postpartum.​[^[246]]

| **fexofenadine** (Allegra) | 120 mg daily PO (given as 60 mg BID or as 120 mg once daily) | Preferred by patients due to ease of administration and because it is nonsedating.​[76] Sedation and anticholinergic effects, including mucosal drying, which may inhibit lactation but less common than with first-generation antihistamines.​[78] | Monitor patient for sedation and anticholinergic effects, e.g., dry mouth.​[78]Monitor breastfeeding infant for signs of irritability, excessive crying and altered sleep.​[6]​[79] If infant experiences these effects or if patient's symptoms do not improve after 1 wk, reassess. | Pregnancy:Animal data suggest possible concerns. Very limited human data available.​[83]​[90]​[91] Considered an alternative agent to those with better and/or more safety data.Breastfeeding:Likely transferred into breast milk in small amounts. AAP classifies it as compatible with breastfeeding; however, no specific data are available. Limited data available for the parent compound (terfenadine).​[6]​[90]Theoretically less likely to cause sedation or irritability in an infant than first-generation antihistamines. |
| **loratadine** (Claritin, generics) | 10 mg once daily PO | Preferred by patients due to ease of administration and because it is nonsedating.​[76] Sedation and anticholinergic effects, including mucosal drying, which may inhibit lactation but less common than with first-generation antihistamines.​[78] | Monitor patient for sedation and anticholinergic effects, e.g., dry mouth.​[78]Monitor breastfeeding infant for signs of irritability, excessive crying and altered sleep.​[6]​[79] If infant experiences these effects or if patient's symptoms do not improve after 1 wk, reassess. | Pregnancy:Considered safe in pregnancy, although more safety data are available for first-generation antihistamines.​[3]​[77]​[83]​[87]​[92]Breastfeeding:Small amounts transferred into breast milk.​[6]​[79]AAP and BSACI classify it as compatible with breastfeeding.​[88]​[92]Theoretically less likely to cause sedation or irritability in an infant than first-generation antihistamines. |
| **codeine** (generics) | 10–60 mg Q4–6H PRN PO (maximum 120 mg/day)​[93] | Sedation, constipation, palpitations, dizziness.​[94] | Use under health-care practitioner supervision. Should not exceed 4 days in a breastfeeding patient. Closely monitor breastfeeding infants for sedation, lethargy, grey skin and poor milk intake; refer to appropriate health-care practitioner if these symptoms develop.​[6]​[79]​[95] In most cases, there is consistency between CNS depression in patient and infant. If the patient is symptomatic (e.g., somnolent, groggy), the infant should be examined for signs of CNS depression.​[94] | Pregnancy:Data do not suggest risk of birth defects.​[94]​[96]If possible, avoid use in the first trimester.Avoid long-term use or high doses close to term (risk of neonatal opiate withdrawal).​[94]Breastfeeding:Indicated for nonproductive cough.​[93]Patients who are ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 had increased conversion of codeine to morphine, which resulted in death of a breastfed infant. Although a minority of the population are rapid metabolizers of 2D6, caution is warranted; use the lowest effective dose for 4 days or less, or use alternative treatment options.​[6]​[79]​[95] |
| **dextromethorphan** (Benylin DM, Robitussin DM, generics) | 10–20 mg Q4H or 30 mg Q6–8H PO (maximum 120 mg/ day)​[97] | Minimal. | Monitor infant for sedation.​[6]If symptoms do not improve after 1 wk, reassess. | Choose ethanol-free products.Pregnancy:Considered safe in pregnancy.Most data support no increased risk of congenital effects.​[12]​[82]​[98] Breastfeeding:Indicated for nonproductive cough.​[97]No data in human breastfeeding, but considered probably safe.​[6]​[79]​[98] |
| **fluticasone** (Flonase, generics) | 2 sprays (50 mcg/spray) per nostril once daily, may increase to BID in severe situations; maximum 400 mcg/day | Nasal irritation, sore throat.​[99] | Monitor patient for nasal irritation, sore throat and reduced milk supply.Monitor breastfeeding infant for reduction in feeding, growth, weight gain.​[100] | Pregnancy:Avoid use in the first trimester if possible.​[101]No human data. Considered probably compatible with pregnancy based on low systemic bioavailability and safety of other inhaled corticosteroids in asthma.​[102]Breastfeeding:No human data. Considered probably compatible based on minimal maternal systemic absorption via intranasal route.​[79]​[100]​[102] |
| **mometasone** (Nasonex, generics) | 2 sprays in each nostril once dailyReduce to 1 spray in each nostril once daily if possible | Nasal irritation, sore throat.​[99] | Monitor patient for nasal irritation, sore throat and reduced milk supply.Monitor breastfeeding infant for reduction in feeding, growth, weight gain.​[103] | Pregnancy:Avoid use in first trimester if possible.​[101]No human data. Considered probably compatible with pregnancy based on low systemic bioavailability and safety of other inhaled corticosteroids in asthma.​[104]Breastfeeding:No human data. Considered probably compatible based on minimal maternal systemic absorption via intranasal route.​[79]​[103]​[104] |

| **phenylephrine** (, Robitussin, generics) | 10 mg Q4H PO (maximum 60 mg/day) Efficacy at currently recommended oral dosages has been questioned​[107] | Signs and symptoms of adrenergic stimulation; palpitations, increased blood pressure, nervousness, insomnia, dizziness.​[107] May reduce milk production. | If patient's adverse effects intolerable or symptoms do not improve after 1 wk, reassess. Monitor infants for signs and symptoms of adrenergic stimulation, e.g., irritability, excessive crying, altered sleep patterns.​[6] | Pregnancy:Limited evidence of possible association with endocardial cushion defect with first-trimester use; however, absolute risk minimal.​[108]​[109] Potentially can reduce uterine blood flow.​[77]​[82]​[110] If possible, avoid use, particularly in the first trimester.​[77]​[109]Breastfeeding:Although oral bioavailability is low, it may be transferred into breast milk in small amounts. No data in human breastfeeding are available. May reduce milk production.​[6]​[79] Not preferred, as alternatives with better and/or more safety data exist. |
| **pseudoephedrine** (Sudafed, generics) | 30–60 mg Q4–6H PO (maximum 240 mg/day) | Signs and symptoms of adrenergic stimulation; palpitations, increased blood pressure, nervousness, insomnia, dizziness.​[107] May reduce milk production. | If patient's adverse effects intolerable or symptoms do not improve after 1 wk, reassess.

Some sources recommend avoidance of pseudoephedrine during the first trimester based on a single, small study showing increased risk of gastroschisis;​[113] however, a subsequent, larger study from the same group did not show increased risk.​[109]Breastfeeding:Transferred into breast milk in small amounts but AAP classifies it as compatible with breastfeeding. Irritability has been reported in breastfed infants. Avoid in patients with insufficient milk production.​[6]​[79]​[112] |
| **oxymetazoline** (Claritin Allergy Decongestant, Dristan Long Lasting Nasal Mist, Drixoral, generics) | Use lowest effective dose according to manufacturer's instructions | Local burning and stinging, sneezing, dryness of nasal mucosa.Use sparingly (maximum 3–5 days) to minimize tolerance or rebound congestion.​[12] | If symptoms do not improve after 3–5 days, refer to physician.​[12] Monitor infants for signs and symptoms of adrenergic stimulation, e.g., irritability, excessive crying, altered sleep patterns.​[6] | Pregnancy: Generally considered safe in pregnancy;​[82]​[87] however, data on safety are limited and conflicting.​[109]​[114] No adverse effects reported with single dose use.​[115] Using higher than the recommended dose may reduce uterine blood flow.​[116]Breastfeeding:No data in human breastfeeding. Preferred over oral agents due to presumed low systemic absorption.​[4]​[6]​[79] |
