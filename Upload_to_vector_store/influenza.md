#### Introduction

Influenza is an acute viral illness of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza A or influenza B virus.​[^[1]] Illness may be mild to severe and can be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A typical influenza season in Canada runs from mid-October to the end of April.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a term often used in public health influenza surveillance programs that refers to any acute illness having symptoms typical of influenza. ILI is defined as an acute onset of respiratory illness with fever, cough and 1 or more of: sore throat, headache, anorexia, arthralgia, myalgia or extreme exhaustion/weakness. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be present in children <5 years of age. Fever may not be prominent in children <5 years of age or adults ≥65 years of age.​[^[1]]

The clinical overlap of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections and other respiratory viruses (e.g., adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus) that may cause similar symptoms adds complexity to the recognition and diagnosis of influenza for both surveillance and clinical purposes.

#### Investigations



#### Prevention

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Adults with influenza can spread the disease 1 day prior to symptom onset and remain contagious for approximately 5 days following presentation of symptoms.​[^[12]] Children and immunocompromised individuals may be contagious for a longer period.​[^[12]]

General measures to prevent the spread of influenza include the following:



In the event of a cluster of ILI in a nursing home or other long-term care setting, implement the following measures to reduce the potential of influenza spreading from symptomatic to well residents (see Figure 1):



#### Pharmacologic Choices

See Table 2 for a list of drugs and vaccines used in the prevention of influenza.

#### Influenza Vaccine

October to mid-November is the usual recommended time for influenza immunization in the Northern hemisphere. Annual influenza vaccination of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications (see Table 1) remains the primary strategy for the reduction of influenza-related morbidity and mortality in both community and long-term care settings. In addition, annual vaccination of individuals who have significant contact with individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications (see Table 1) or who provide essential community services is recommended.

Significant illness and societal costs also occur with seasonal influenza in people who may not be considered at high risk of complications (healthy people 5–64 years of age). Therefore, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) also encourages all Canadians to receive the influenza vaccine. See Table 2 for a description of available influenza vaccines in Canada; the exact type of influenza vaccines available through publicly funded immunization programs may vary among provincial/territorial jurisdictions.

|  |
| --- |
| People at high risk for influenza-related complications:Adults and children with the following chronic health conditions:cardiac or respiratory disorders (including asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis)diabetes mellitus or other metabolic disordercancer or immune-compromising conditions (due to underlying disease and/or therapy)renal diseaseanemia or hemoglobinopathyneurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions (children: seizure disorders, febrile seizures and isolated developmental delay; adults: neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions and seizure disorders, excepting migraines and neuropsychiatric conditions without neurologic conditions)morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m​2)children and adolescents (6 months–18 y) requiring chronic ASA therapyResidents (of any age) of nursing homes and other long-term care facilitiesAll individuals ≥65 y of ageAll children 6–59 months of ageAll pregnant individuals (all trimesters)Indigenous peoples​[b] |
| People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications:Health-care workers and other care providers in all practice settings, e.g., volunteers, housekeeping staffHousehold contacts (adults and children) of high-risk individuals including:high-risk groups mentioned aboveinfants <6 monthsmembers of a household expecting a newborn during influenza seasonPeople who provide regular child care to children 0–59 months of age, whether in or out of the homePeople who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to individuals at high risk, e.g., crew on a ship |
| Other:People who provide essential community services, e.g., first respondersPeople who are in direct contact with avian influenza–infected poultry during culling operations |


Canadian residents travel widely and may visit areas with high influenza transmission. Influenza occurs all year round in the tropics, e.g., Asia, Caribbean region, and peaks during the winter season, i.e., April–October in the Southern hemisphere. Cruise ships also present high-risk exposure to influenza. NACI encourages influenza immunization for all Canadians ≥6 months of age, including travellers (see Table 1).​[^[12]] Travellers are advised to review their vaccination status with their health-care practitioner prior to departure to ensure they have received an influenza vaccine available in Canada that will minimize their risk of influenza-related complications.​[^[12]]

Previous NACI statements recommended the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) preferentially for children 2–17 years of age based on earlier placebo-controlled trials and postmarketing surveillance that demonstrated superior vaccine efficacy compared with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3).​[^[12]] However, this recommendation is no longer supported, since data across several jurisdictions indicate that LAIV appears to confer protection similar to injectable influenza vaccines.​[^[12]]

Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) contain strains related to both lineages of influenza B, providing broader protection against influenza B. Canadian surveillance data indicate that influenza B accounts for 17% of all laboratory-confirmed influenza. The greatest burden of influenza B illness is proportionally seen in those <20 years of age and accounts for 15–58% of influenza-related pediatric hospital admissions.​[^[12]] Given the burden of illness in children 6 months to 17 years of age, NACI recommends that IIV4 be used in this group.​[^[12]] If IIV4 is not available, IIV3 (in patients 6 to <24 months of age) or LAIV may be used.​[^[12]]

Age-related immunosenescence, where older individuals are unable to mount a protective immunogenic response to standard-dose vaccines, is one of the challenges in protecting this group against influenza. In a recent review by NACI, it was concluded that the evidence supports high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD), adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-Adj) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) having increased benefit as compared to IIV-SD (standard-dose IIV), with no difference in safety. Therefore, if available, IIV-HD, IIV-Adj or RIV should be offered to adults ≥65 years of age rather than other influenza vaccines. If a preferred product is not available, any of the available age-appropriate influenza vaccines may be used.​[^[14]]

####### Influenza Vaccination in Egg-Allergic Individuals

With clinical evidence demonstrating safe administration of influenza vaccine in individuals with egg allergies,​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] NACI recommendations have evolved over the past few years. Egg-allergic adults and children may be vaccinated against influenza using any available influenza vaccine (see Table 2) without a prior influenza skin test, irrespective of the immunization setting or a past severe reaction to egg.​[^[12]] As with all vaccines, immunization providers should be prepared for, and have the necessary equipment to respond to, vaccine emergencies at all times.

####### Oculorespiratory Syndrome (ORS)

ORS was initially identified during the 2000–2001 influenza season and has been observed, though rarely, in subsequent seasons.​[^[19]] It is characterized by the presence of bilateral red eyes plus 1 or more respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, sore throat), with or without facial swelling, that occurs within 24 hours of receiving influenza vaccination and resolves within 48 hours of symptom onset.​[^[12]]​[^[19]] ORS is not considered an allergic reaction and is not a contraindication to vaccination. Individuals who have experienced ORS without mild to moderate lower respiratory symptoms can safely receive influenza vaccine in subsequent seasons.​[^[12]] Those who have had ORS with lower respiratory symptoms should be referred to the local Medical Officer of Health and assessed prior to vaccination.​[^[12]]

####### Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

Data suggest that the absolute risk of GBS following influenza illness exceeds the risk observed following influenza vaccination (approximately 17 excess cases vs. 1 excess case per million vaccines administered).​[^[12]] Although there is presently insufficient evidence to either confirm or refute a causal association between seasonal influenza vaccine and GBS, it is recommended that subsequent influenza vaccination should be avoided in adults who experienced GBS within 6 weeks of receiving influenza vaccine.​[^[12]]

#### Antiviral Agents

Antiviral agents have their greatest preventive utility in the long-term care environment (see Figure 1).​[^[8]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]] When an influenza outbreak is identified in a long-term care setting, antiviral prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible to all residents who are not yet ill, regardless of their vaccination status, as well as to nonimmunized health-care providers.

Oseltamivir is the first-line agent during outbreaks of influenza A (if expected to be sensitive) or influenza B. When using the treatment alternative zanamivir as chemoprophylaxis, clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of bronchospasm in individuals with pre-existing severe respiratory disease and the potential difficulty experienced by some frail older patients in using the inhaler device. Zanamivir should not be reconstituted nor administered via nebulizer.

Monitoring of antiviral resistance of circulating influenza viruses has been incorporated into national surveillance programs, e.g., FluWatch. Amantadine has exhibited high levels of resistance and is therefore no longer recommended for prophylaxis.​[^[8]] Some resistance has been documented against the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, but is reported at <1%.​[^[22]]

In a long-term care setting, continue surveillance for new cases of ILI to establish effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in controlling an influenza outbreak once postexposure prophylaxis is initiated in a facility. Regardless of the agent used, identification of drug-resistant strains of influenza A during outbreak situations demands a change in therapy.

If cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza continue to occur more than 96 hours after initiation of antiviral prophylaxis, consider antiviral prophylaxis failure.​[^[23]] Contact the local Medical Officer of Health for assistance.

#### Treatment

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Analgesics/Antipyretic Agents

Use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for relief of fever, headache and myalgias. To avoid overdose, caution patients about the concurrent use of cough and cold products that contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Cough and cold products contain other ingredients such as antihistamines, which may not be needed.

Children and adolescents should *not* take ASA due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome (see Fever).

#### Antiviral Agents

The use of antiviral agents for treatment of influenza in healthy children and adults is not recommended;​[^[24]]​[^[25]] however, they should be considered for treatment in individuals 1–64 years of age who have a chronic condition or are immunocompromised and in those ≥65 years of age when influenza is either laboratory confirmed or strongly suspected based on symptoms and known local circulation. The use of antiviral agents for treatment of influenza in the community setting is illustrated in Figure 2.

 The usual duration of influenza symptoms is 4–7 days. Studies in otherwise healthy adults and children demonstrated that neuraminidase inhibitors reduce the duration of symptoms by about 0.5–1 day.​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Although controversial, early treatment with oseltamivir (within 12 h) may reduce influenza-related complications (need for antibiotics, hospitalizations, asthma exacerbations) in children ≤2 years of age​[^[8]] as well as in adults and children >2 years of age at high-risk of complications.​[^[8]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

Treatment with any antiviral agent is best initiated within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.​[^[8]] However, initiation of treatment should be considered beyond 48 hours in the following circumstances: the illness is serious enough to require hospitalization; the illness is progressive, severe or complicated, regardless of previous health status; or the individual belongs to a group at high risk for influenza-related complications (see Table 1).​[^[8]]​[^[33]]

In the community and long-term care setting, the duration of treatment for both children and adults is 5 days.​[^[8]] This is an adequate treatment period and it minimizes the risk of resistance.

Two new antivirals (baloxavir and peramivir) have been approved for use by Health Canada but are not yet available in Canada. Both agents have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of uncomplicated influenza by approximately 1 day when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.​[^[34]]​[^[35]] 

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Influenza and Pregnancy

Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of influenza-related complications not only in those with comorbidities but also in healthy pregnant individuals.​[^[36]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]] The risk appears to be the greatest during the third trimester.​[^[38]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]] Immunization of the pregnant individual appears to extend protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza to infants following birth and up to 6 months of age,​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]] possibly via maternal-infant transfer of antibodies.​[^[44]] There is also evidence suggesting that infants born to vaccinated individuals during influenza season are less likely to be premature or small for gestational age, or to have low birth weight.​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]]

#### Management

Prevention is the best strategy to reduce maternal morbidity associated with seasonal influenza. Immunization with seasonal inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine appears to be both safe and effective in all stages of pregnancy.​[^[12]]​[^[49]] Until safety data are available, do not use the LAIV vaccines in those who are pregnant; however, they may be used in those who are breastfeeding.​[^[49]]

Acetaminophen may be used to treat fever and pain associated with influenza infection.​[^[50]] NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) are not recommended after 20 weeks’ gestation due to a potential reduction in amniotic fluid​[^[51]] and the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus if used in the third trimester.​[^[52]]

Both oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to be safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding based on preclinical and observational reports.​[^[53]]​[^[54]]​[^[55]] Oseltamivir is recommended over zanamivir as more safety data are available and its systemic absorption is expected to result in more consistent delivery to virus-infected respiratory tissues, especially in the later stages of pregnancy when distribution of inhaled zanamivir may be affected by the gravid uterus.​[^[55]] As such, early treatment with oseltamivir is recommended for those who are pregnant.​[^[8]] There is no evidence to support the use of baloxavir or peramivir in pregnancy or breastfeeding. 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart detailing procedures for managing influenza in a healthcare setting. Here's a detailed description:

### Prior to Influenza Season
- **Develop policies & procedures** for annual influenza immunization of residents and staff.
- **Develop policies & procedures** for appropriate antiviral agents prescribed for residents in the event of an outbreak.
- **Determine appropriate antiviral doses** for all residents (for medically stable residents, may use serum creatinine measured within past 12 months to calculate ClCr for dosage determination).
- **Educate staff** on signs & symptoms of ILI (Influenza-Like Illness), proper hand hygiene, use of PPE, droplet/contact precautions, and importance of obtaining nasopharyngeal swabs for laboratory confirmation of influenza.

### Detection of Cases
- **≥2 cases of ILI within a 72-hour period** triggers further actions.

### Response Actions
- **Implement droplet/contact precautions.**
- **Identify the total number of residents & staff who have ILI.**
- **Determine whether the attack rate varies among units/floors.**
- **Collect nasopharyngeal swabs** from all symptomatic residents within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.
- **Notify public health officials.**

### Laboratory Testing Outcomes
1. **Laboratory test negative for influenza, and influenza not circulating in community:**
   - Treat patients symptomatically as appropriate.
   - Identify other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, SARS-CoV-2).
   - Consider isolation until symptoms resolve.

2. **Influenza laboratory-confirmed or influenza known to be circulating in the community:**
   - **Symptomatic Residents:**
     - Use antipyretics/analgesics as appropriate.
     - Administer appropriate antiviral agent for 5 days.
     - Isolate until symptoms resolve.
     - Minimize staff movement among units.
     - Dedicate staff to care for symptomatic residents only (staff should have received influenza vaccine).
     - Enhance environmental cleaning.

   - **Asymptomatic Residents:**
     - Offer vaccine to all unvaccinated residents and staff.
     - Administer prophylaxis with appropriate antiviral agent for duration of outbreak.
     - Continue to monitor for new cases of ILI to establish effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis in controlling outbreak (see text).

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing influenza outbreaks, emphasizing prevention, early detection, and appropriate response measures.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for managing patients with uncomplicated influenza-like illness (ILI), characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, nasal congestion, and cough. Here’s a detailed description of the flowchart:

1. **Initial Presentation:**
   - Patient presents with uncomplicated ILI.

2. **Influenza Confirmation:**
   - **Decision Point:** Is influenza present in the community or has an influenza virus outbreak been confirmed by public health authorities?
     - **No:** The condition is probably not influenza, and COVID-19 is ruled out. Treat symptomatically.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to the next decision point.

3. **Coughing Purulent Sputum:**
   - **Decision Point:** Is the patient coughing purulent sputum?
     - **Yes:** Consider bacterial pneumonia.
     - **No:** Proceed to patient categorization.

4. **Patient Categorization:**
   - **Child <5 years:**
     - Consider treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (NA) based on clinical assessment.
     - Healthy children with mild illness do not routinely require treatment with NA.
     - Educate caregiver on when to contact a healthcare practitioner.
   
   - **Patient 5–64 years and no risk factors, immunocompetent:**
     - No routine NA treatment, but may consider if illness is less than 48 hours.
     - Educate caregiver/patient on when to contact a healthcare practitioner.
   
   - **Patient with risk factors:**
     - If illness is less than 48 hours, treat with NA for more than 5 days.
     - Treatment may be considered if illness is more than 48 hours.
     - Educate patient on when to contact a healthcare practitioner.

5. **Footnotes:**
   - **b:** Specific considerations for children under 5 years.
   - **c:** Definition or examples of risk factors are not provided in the image.
