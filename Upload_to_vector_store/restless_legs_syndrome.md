CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women,” “female” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a neurologic disorder characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs accompanied by an urge to move the legs, especially at bedtime.​[^[1]] The cause of primary RLS is not definitively known but is believed to involve a genetic component as well as dysfunctional dopaminergic transmission and low brain iron stores. Secondary RLS is associated with many conditions such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (anemia may play a role), iron deficiency, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, pregnancy and venous insufficiency.

Symptoms of RLS occur when the limbs are at rest and are relieved by movement. In severe cases, symptoms may extend to the arms and trunk. Symptoms are commonly bilateral and symmetrical but can be unilateral on occasion. The prevalence of RLS is estimated to be 5–15% in the general population,​[^[1]]​[^[2]] is higher in women and increases with age. Patients often use the following terms to describe the symptoms of RLS: a “creepy-crawly,” “burning,” “nagging,” “aching,” “painful,” “itching-bones” or “electric-current” sensation. These unpleasant sensations may last hours and may persist throughout the night, causing sleep disturbance in some patients.

 All of the following 5 criteria are required for a diagnosis of RLS:​[^[3]]



Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness (PLM) or during sleep (PLMS).​[^[3]]

Intermittent RLS is defined as symptoms that occur on average less than twice a week but are troublesome enough to require treatment. In chronic persistent RLS, symptoms cause moderate to severe distress and are frequent and bothersome enough to require daily therapy.​[^[4]] Symptoms occur on average at least twice a week. In refractory RLS, symptoms persist due to inadequate response to or intolerable side effects of adequately dosed first-line therapy and/or augmentation.

Augmentation, a paradoxical response to dopaminergic therapy, is the occurrence of symptoms earlier in the day, a shorter latency time to symptom onset when at rest, an increase in the severity of symptoms with shorter treatment effect, and/or the spread of symptoms to involve the upper extremities and trunk.​[^[5]] Another known issue with drug therapy is rebound: the recurrence of symptoms during the night or early morning coinciding with the end-of-dose wearing off of effectiveness.​[^[6]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

While pharmacologic therapy is needed for moderate to severe symptoms, nonpharmacologic measures may be useful in milder cases:



In patients who do not respond to pharmacotherapy or who experience intolerable side effects, consider a trial of pneumatic compression devices (PCDs), garments that are intermittently inflated and deflated with compressed air using an electrical pneumatic pump. In a small randomized sham-controlled study of 1 month's duration, patients who wore PCDs on their legs for at least 1 hour daily prior to the usual onset time of moderate to severe RLS symptoms had improvement in quality of life scores and clinically significant improvement in RLS symptoms.​[^[11]]

| Potential Cause | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Antidepressants | Mirtazapine is most commonly reported. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often associated with other movement disorders (e.g., akathisia, bruxism, dystonia), but the association with RLS is not as clear.​[13] Most cases resolve with dosage reduction or replacement with alternative. Bupropion is often considered as an alternative due to its dopaminergic properties. |
| Antiemetics | Dopamine-blocking antiemetics (e.g., prochlorperazine, metoclopramide). |
| Antiepileptics | Topiramate is most commonly reported. Most cases resolve upon discontinuation. |
| Antihistamines | First-generation, sedating antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine). |
| Antipsychotics | Quetiapine, olanzapine and clozapine are most commonly reported. |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

Studies have shown that 25–30% of patients with RLS are iron deficient.​[^[14]] The incidence of secondary RLS is increased in patients with conditions associated with iron deficiency such as pregnancy and end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, RLS may be the only clinical indicator of iron deficiency and can be more severe in patients with serum ferritin less than 50 mcg/L (normal range is 40–200 mcg/L).​[^[4]] When patients present with RLS symptoms, investigate for the possible presence and cause of iron deficiency. A trial of **oral** iron **therapy** should be considered for patients in whom a deficiency is detected (<75 mcg/L) or in patients with refractory symptoms.​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] For more information about treatment of iron deficiency anemia, see Common Anemias.

The choice of pharmacologic agent depends on the severity of RLS symptoms. See Table 2 for a list of drug therapy options for RLS.

Levodopa **preparations**, benzodiazepines or **low-potency** opioids are good options for treatment of intermittent RLS.​[^[4]] In chronic persistent RLS, dopamine agonists or **GABA derivatives** are the preferred agents.​[^[18]] Dopamine agonists may pose a lower risk of augmentation compared with levodopa, while GABA derivatives have minimal risk.​[^[4]]​[^[19]] Figure 1 illustrates the clinical management of intermittent and chronic persistent RLS.

In patients with refractory RLS, lower doses of single-agent therapy are not effective. Consider combining treatment from different drug classes, i.e., dopamine agonists, GABA derivatives, benzodiazepines or opioids.​[^[4]]​[^[19]] Figure 2 illustrates clinical management of refractory RLS.

#### Pharmacotherapy for Intermittent RLS

#### Levodopa Preparations

Many clinical trials have shown levodopa/​carbidopa to be effective for the treatment of RLS.​[^[20]] While levodopa may be suitable for patients with intermittent symptoms, its short half-life increases the potential for rebound and/or augmentation and makes it a poor choice for patients with daily symptoms.

#### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines do not improve the core symptoms of RLS, but they are appropriate for improving sleep quality in patients with intermittent RLS or as an adjunct to first-line agents in refractory RLS. The main limitation of this drug class is the potential for dependence and the risk of falls and cognitive impairment in elderly patients; accordingly, benzodiazepines are not recommended if daily therapy is required.

Clinical trials have shown that clonazepam significantly improves objective sleep efficiency and subjective sleep quality in both RLS and PLMS.​[^[21]] Clonazepam has a long half-life and a potential to cause morning sedation and dizziness. All benzodiazepines are considered potentially inappropriate in the elderly according to the Beers Criteria, so clinicians should weigh risks and benefits before recommending in this population.​[^[22]] If a trial of a benzodiazepine is warranted in an older adult, consider using agents with short or intermediate duration of action, such as temazepam (see Benzodiazepines (CPhA Monograph)).

#### Opioids

Opioids have been used to treat RLS since its earliest description; their clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in several controlled and open clinical trials.​[^[23]] The strong sedating properties of opioids may be responsible for their effectiveness rather than any effect on leg movements. There is growing concern over the number of deaths linked to the use of opioid drugs and the growing opioid-related public health crisis. Patients and physicians need clear information about how to use opioids safely and the risks of using them; patients must be carefully selected, and close supervision and follow-up ensured. Due to the potential for dependence, low-potency opioids such as codeine are a better choice for intermittent RLS. More potent agents such as oxycodone or methadone are reserved for RLS that is refractory to other treatments. Patients who experience constipation as an adverse effect may benefit from oxycodone/​naloxone controlled-release tablets.​[^[24]] Patients should be evaluated for sleep apnea before opioids are prescribed.​[^[25]]

Although tramadol has shown some benefit in the treatment of RLS,​[^[26]] there are case reports of RLS augmentation​[^[27]] and RLS as an adverse effect with this agent.​[^[28]]

#### Pharmacotherapy for Chronic Persistent RLS

#### Dopamine Agonists

Dopamine agonists have a long half-life and are associated with a lower incidence of augmentation compared with levodopa, making them a better choice for long-term treatment of RLS.​[^[25]] Consider these agents first in patients who have severe symptoms, excessive weight, comorbid depression, cognitive impairment or who are at increased risk of falling.​[^[25]] The efficacy of bromocriptine,​[^[29]] pramipexole,​[^[30]] ropinirole​[^[31]] and rotigotine​[^[32]] in the treatment of RLS has been established in controlled clinical trials. These agents improve sleep efficiency and decrease the frequency of periodic limb movements during sleep. Side effects of dopamine agonists include nausea, sedation and lightheadedness; these generally decrease after the first few months of therapy.​[^[25]] Clinicians should inform patients that dopamine agonists are associated with a high risk (6–17%) of developing a compulsive behaviour such as pathological gambling and hypersexuality.​[^[25]]​[^[33]] These disorders may be associated with higher doses of drugs; however, impulse control disorders have been reported in low doses for the treatment of restless legs. Monitor for these behaviours at each patient visit and discontinue or decrease the dosage of the dopamine agonist if the adverse effect is significant.​[^[25]] When discontinuing dopamine agonist treatment, taper the dose gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms.​[^[25]]

Pramipexole and ropinirole are nonergoline derivatives and have a more favourable side effect profile in patients with RLS; they are used preferentially over bromocriptine, an ergoline derivative that is associated with a higher frequency of adverse effects. When used at higher doses in the treatment of Parkinson disease, dopamine agonists have been associated with a higher incidence of sudden sleep attacks.

Rotigotine is a nonergolinic dopamine agonist that is officially approved to treat symptoms of moderate to severe idiopathic RLS in patients 18 years of age or older. The transdermal system is formulated to deliver rotigotine over a 24-hour period.

#### GABA Derivatives

GABA derivatives are alternatives to dopamine agonists in the treatment of chronic persistent RLS and are not associated with a significant risk of augmentation. Consider these agents first in patients who have severe sleep disturbance, comorbid insomnia or anxiety, painful RLS, or a history of compulsive behaviour or anxiety.​[^[25]] Gabapentin and pregabalin are administered once or twice daily later in the day (afternoon, evening or before sleep). Gabapentin was shown to be effective in open-label​[^[34]] and double-blind, randomized controlled trials.​[^[35]] Consider switching to pregabalin in patients who develop augmentation with a dopamine agonist. In a year-long double-blind trial, 719 patients with RLS were randomized to once daily doses of pregabalin 300 mg, pramipexole 0.25 mg, pramipexole 0.5 mg or 12 weeks of placebo followed by 40 weeks of one of the active treatments.​[^[36]] Pregabalin was shown to significantly improve RLS symptom scores compared with placebo and was associated with significantly lower augmentation rates compared with pramipexole 0.5 mg. Major side effects of these agents include drowsiness and unsteady gait, especially in the elderly. Suicide-related events have been reported with GABA derivatives; monitor patients for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours.

Gabapentin enacarbil is a novel prodrug of gabapentin that is not currently available in Canada. This agent was developed to address the pharmacokinetic limitations of gabapentin and can be administered once daily. Its effectiveness in the treatment of RLS has been shown in several randomized controlled trials.​[^[37]]

#### Other Agents

Antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and valproic acid have not been as rigorously studied as the GABA derivatives.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] There is some evidence for improved RLS symptoms with other agents such as amantadine,​[^[40]] baclofen,​[^[41]] clonidine​[^[42]] and nortriptyline,​[^[43]] but it is insufficient to make a recommendation. There is insufficient evidence to recommend bupropion, selenium, rifaximin or **botulinum toxin**.​[^[18]] These drugs should be reserved for patients who do not respond to or tolerate recommended first-line agents.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### RLS and Pregnancy

RLS symptoms are common during pregnancy, with an estimated prevalence of 10–20%.​[^[44]] The exact cause is not known, but possible contributors include deficiency of iron and vitamins and changes in estrogen levels.​[^[45]] Symptoms of RLS are most often a feature of the third trimester and are usually temporary, with most symptoms disappearing soon after childbirth.

None of the drugs used to treat RLS are known to be safe in pregnancy. Nonpharmacologic choices are therefore the safest treatments for patients who experience RLS during pregnancy and are recommended as first-line options.​[^[46]] It is important to rule out iron deficiency, as appropriate supplementation may be helpful. RLS typically becomes more severe as the pregnancy progresses. If pharmacologic therapy is deemed necessary, waiting until the second trimester will reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.​[^[47]] Levodopa/​carbidopa may be considered.​[^[46]] Opioids can be used in severe and refractory cases, but should be avoided near term because of the risk of respiratory depression in the newborn. The need for pharmacologic therapy should be re-evaluated regularly. For most pregnant patients, RLS is temporary and the symptoms will typically resolve postpartum. Educating patients about the self-limiting nature of symptoms may allay fears.

#### RLS and Breastfeeding

As in pregnancy, nonpharmacologic choices are the safest option for patients experiencing RLS when breastfeeding. There is no available information on the use of pramipexole, ropinirole and rotigotine in breastfeeding, but these drugs suppress serum prolactin and may interfere with lactation.​[^[48]] Limited data indicate that levodopa is poorly transferred into breast milk and that sustained-release formulations may result in a smaller amount of drug transferred to the breastfed infant than immediate-release products.​[^[49]] Several studies indicate that levodopa can decrease serum prolactin during lactation, but a reduced prolactin level may not affect breastfeeding once lactation has been established.​[^[50]]​[^[51]] The effect of long-term use of levodopa on breastfeeding has not been adequately evaluated.

Limited information indicates that doses of gabapentin and pregabalin in the breastfeeding patient may produce relatively low levels in the infant's serum.​[^[48]] If pharmacologic therapy is deemed necessary in a breastfeeding patient, **gabapentin** may be an appropriate choice, since there is more data to support its use.​[^[46]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

### Chronic Persistent Restless Legs Syndrome
- **Definition**: Symptoms are frequent and bothersome enough to require daily therapy.
- **Management Options**:
  - **Pharmacologic Therapy**:
    - **Iron-replacement therapy**: Recommended if ferritin levels are below 75 mcg/L.
    - **Daily use of**:
      - Nonergoline dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, or transdermal rotigotine)
      - GABA derivative (gabapentin, pregabalin)
    - If the first drug is ineffective or not tolerated, switch to another agent in the same class.
    - If one or more drugs in the class are ineffective or not tolerated, change to an agent in another class.
    - If lack of effect or not tolerated, treat as refractory restless leg syndrome (refer to Figure 2).

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing Refractory Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which is unresponsive to monotherapy with first-line agents for chronic persistent RLS.

1. **Initial Step:**
   - **Recheck serum ferritin.**
     - If ferritin is less than 75 mcg/L, start oral iron replacement therapy.
     - If there is poor absorption or the therapy is poorly tolerated, consider parenteral iron.

2. **Next Step:**
   - **Consider and correct other possible exacerbating factors,** such as changes in medications, lifestyle, or other causes of sleep disturbance.

3. **Combination Therapy:**
   - Consider using agents from different drug classes:
     - Dopamine agonists
     - GABA derivatives
     - Benzodiazepines
     - Low- or high-potency opioids

4. **Severe Refractory RLS:**
   - If RLS is resistant to other treatments, consider monotherapy with a high-potency opioid, such as oxycodone or methadone.

The flowchart provides a structured approach to managing refractory RLS by addressing iron deficiency, correcting exacerbating factors, and considering combination or monotherapy with specific drug classes.
