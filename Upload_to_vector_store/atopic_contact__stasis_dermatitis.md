CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Introduction

*CPhA acknowledges the contribution of Debra Sibbald as the previous author of this chapter*

Dermatitis is a nonspecific term describing both acute and chronic skin reactions with corresponding clinical patterns and history. Although the word eczema has been used synonymously with atopic dermatitis, most dermatologists use the term dermatitis to describe an acute, nonspecific skin reaction that exhibits swelling, erythema, scaling, vesicles and crusts. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease caused by mucocutaneous barrier dysfunction. Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction caused by exposure to allergens or irritants. Stasis dermatitis is inflammation of the skin of the lower legs caused by chronic venous insufficiency.

Skin changes in dermatitis reflect the pattern of inflammatory response. The appearance is similar in all forms of dermatitis regardless of cause, with the exception that hyperpigmentation is often more prominent in stasis dermatitis.

When the reaction is acute, the earliest and mildest changes are erythema caused by engorgement and dilatation of the small blood vessels and, usually, edema resulting from leakage of fluid from blood vessels and accumulation in tissues. If swelling is severe, skin cells form vesicles that fill with edema fluid; this process is called vesiculation or blistering. Breakage of blisters results in oozing or weeping, and evaporation of this fluid causes crusting and scaling.

Dermatitis may progress to a chronic stage where the skin becomes dry, fissured and cracked. With prolonged itching and scratching, it thickens and the normal skin markings become more prominent. This process is called lichenification. The skin may show damage from scratching (linear or punctate scarring) and hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.​[^[1]]

#### Pathophysiology

#### Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis and allergic bronchial asthma belong to the atopic syndrome, or atopic diathesis, which is a mucocutaneous barrier dysfunction.​[^[2]] Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with the hyper-reactivity of cutaneous and mucous membranes to environmental triggers that are innocuous to nonatopic individuals.​[^[3]] Atopic dermatitis affects 10–20% of the population. The disease is genetically associated, with a risk of 70% if both parents are afflicted, and a higher risk of inheritance from the mother than the father. There may be genetic differences in skin reactivity, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and ceramide levels,​[^[4]] possibly contributing to an apparent difference in prevalence between populations. Atopic dermatitis is significantly more common in those of higher socioeconomic status, children from small families, and those who live in privately owned properties, possibly reflecting the influence of lifestyle, home furnishings and education.​[^[5]] 

Evidence supports the classical concept of atopic dermatitis as a continuum that begins with genetically impaired epidermal barrier function. Loss-of-function mutations in the FLG gene lead to filaggrin protein deficiency, which is a major determinant of defective barrier function. Breakdown of filaggrin is required to form hygroscopic free amino acids, the major components of the skin's natural moisturizer factor (NMF). Decreased filaggrin, therefore, leads to decreased NMF levels in the skin. With reduced NMF, the skin is less able to maintain hydration and retain water within the stratum corneum when environmental humidity is low.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Increased skin barrier dysfunction (as measured by TEWL) appears to correlate with increased disease severity.​[^[8]] The genetically disrupted barrier then allows penetration of environmental factors and sensitization to allergens and infections, which progress to dermatitis, leading to scratching and ensuing tissue damage. Tissue damage leads to further sensitization to self-proteins and conversion to the “autoallergic” stage of atopic dermatitis, which is associated with high levels of IgE and the concomitant risk of development of asthma and allergic rhinitis.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] Eighty to 85% of patients with atopic dermatitis have high levels of total IgE, which correlate with the severity of clinical disease. Children with mild to moderate disease have much lower levels than those with severe disease.​[^[11]] The IgE trigger causes an eczema-type reaction rather than a classic urticarial reaction. Eosinophils are involved in producing pro-inflammatory products in the skin and mucous membranes. Twenty percent of patients show normal IgE levels and lack specific sensitization against inhalant and food allergens.

Atopic dermatitis is predominantly a disease of childhood.​[^[5]] It begins in infancy but is rarely present at birth, and decreases in intensity with age. In approximately 80% of cases, the problem develops during the first year of life, and in up to 90% of cases, the onset occurs before 5 years of age.​[^[12]] In children younger than 2 years of age, there may be a stronger male-to-female ratio, but this is reversed after 2 years of age, with a slight female preponderance. Increased disease chronicity in females may be responsible.​[^[5]] Incidence of occupational allergic and irritant contact dermatitis is increased in patients with atopic dermatitis. In adults and children, Staphylococcus aureus colonization is high, whereas adult skin is more heavily colonized with Malassezia yeasts.​[^[13]]

#### Contact Dermatitis

Contact dermatitis is a pattern of inflammatory responses in the skin that occurs through contact with external factors. The clinical picture is a polymorphic pattern of skin inflammation characterized by a wide range of clinical features, including itching, swelling, redness and scaling. Contact dermatitis is a common occupational disease and is also caused by cosmetics, skin-care products and other chemicals such as textile dyes in clothing and outdoor plants. Aggravating factors play a large role since the extent and severity varies with the frequency and duration of exposure; presence of infected, inflamed or burned skin; degree of allergic sensitivity; and mechanical factors such as pressure, friction and excessive perspiration, which may intensify the dermatitis.​[^[14]] Extremes in temperature, humidity, sweating and occlusion can lower the threshold for irritation.​[^[15]] Secondary infection with bacteria or fungi is more likely in dermatitic skin.​[^[15]]

Contact dermatitis occurs from infancy onwards and is divided into 2 categories: allergic contact dermatitis (20% of patients) and irritant contact dermatitis (80% of patients). Lower incidence of allergic contact dermatitis among children is due to limited exposure to allergens.​[^[16]]

Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed or T cell–driven hypersensitivity immune reaction mediated by lymphocytes that have been previously sensitized, either by exposure to contact allergens or to haptens (small molecules capable of permeating the stratum corneum that elicit an immune response only when bound to a larger carrier such as a skin protein). Allergenic substances must be processed within the epidermis by the Langerhans cells that migrate to regional lymph nodes. Here, antigen is conjugated with proteins processed by T lymphocytes, which become specifically reactive to the presented antigen, initiating a sequence of cytokine-mediated events and inflammatory response.​[^[17]] The reactivity of the skin is a result of balance between T lymphocyte hypersensitivity and suppressor cells which invokes allergen tolerance.​[^[17]] Most of these cellular reactions produce sensitization in only a small percentage of those exposed. The incubation period after initial sensitization is 5–21 days and 12–48 hours after subsequent re-exposure, but the reaction may continue to develop for several weeks.​[^[14]] Predisposition to develop allergic contact dermatitis is genetic.​[^[18]] Allergic contact dermatitis decreases with age since the skin of people over 65 is less reactive to allergens, due to diminished immune function that occurs with age.​[^[16]] However, older patients also have impaired epidermal barrier function and slower skin recovery after an insult. In the elderly, eczematous erythroderma (severe widespread redness of the skin) is common.​[^[19]] Elderly patients may acquire allergy to topical preparations used to treat stasis or contact dermatitis.​[^[20]] 

Primary irritant contact dermatitis is a nonallergic reaction resulting from activation of the innate immune system by the direct cytotoxic effect produced by exposure to any substance, including chemical, physical or biologic agents, if the concentration and duration of contact are sufficient. Mild irritants such as soaps, detergents and most solvents require repeated or sustained contact to produce inflammation. Strong irritants such as acids and alkalis may injure the skin immediately. Irritant effects may be considerably enhanced by occlusion. This disruption of the stratum corneum by physical or chemical irritants results in increased skin permeability and TEWL and is considered the initiating event of irritant contact dermatitis. The majority of cases are related to occupation; in particular, jobs that involve work with water or exposure to irritant substances. Hand dermatitis results from frequent washing of the hands, which damages the skin through a combination of mechanisms: increased skin permeability from alkali-induced damage to the keratin, removal of lipids and amino acids from the skin, and alteration of the skin's buffering capacity. Intensification may also be produced by irritants such as waxes, polishes and turpentine and through excoriation or rubbing.​[^[17]] Hand dermatitis may affect 1 in 9 adults in any given year, predominating in females with a ratio greater than 5:1.​[^[21]] Diaper dermatitis is common and is discussed in Diaper Dermatitis.

#### Stasis Dermatitis

Stasis dermatitis (stasis eczema) results from chronic venous insufficiency and is commonly seen in middle-aged or elderly patients, more frequently in females than in males. Approximately one-third of patients have a previous history of deep vein thrombophlebitis related to trauma, pregnancy, surgery or prolonged illness.​[^[14]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The pattern of dermatitis and its trigger factors influence the clinical classification and therapy. An approach to assessing patients with dermatitis is shown in #algorithms-119-04D039D3/psc1056n01129.

#### Atopic Dermatitis

#### Clinical Presentation

Atopic dermatitis presents as an intensely pruritic acute, subacute or chronic eruption seen in characteristic patterns in infants, children and adults. The diagnosis is purely clinical; the symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis are numerous, but usually nonspecific. Itch is the main symptom. There is no primary skin lesion in atopic dermatitis; the clinical presentation of eczematous skin lesions represents skin changes induced by constant scratching and excoriations.​[^[22]] The skin is typically dry and the lesions scaly, though they may be vesicular, weeping or oozing in the acute stage. Clinical presentation supports both debated theories as to the chronology of pruritus and lesions: itch may precede visible skin lesions and/or erythema, and inflammation may evoke pruritus.​[^[23]] Various triggers such as stress result in appearance of erythema followed by itch, then vasodilation and inflammation due to scratching. The pruritus may be focal or generalized if skin is dry and may be most intense during the evening and at night. It is usually intermittent and leads to vigorous itch-scratch cycles, commonly with secondary bacterial infection of excoriated lesions.​[^[14]]

Although atopic dermatitis can affect any area of the body, it preferentially affects the flexures and the face. Distribution of lesions depends on the age of the patient, with infantile, childhood, adolescent and adult phases. In babies less than 6 months of age, the face and scalp are the sites most commonly affected, and redness and chapping of a baby's cheeks can be the earliest sign.​[^[3]] This chapping usually begins at 2–3 months and persists for 2 years. Remission usually occurs between 2 and 4 years of age. Subsequently, a chronically relapsing dermatitis begins, located on the extensor sides of the extremities but also on the flexural areas. The most common sites are the antecubital and popliteal fossa.​[^[3]] It can also be located around the mouth, eyelids, neck and hands. The lips can be dry and scaly. Visual signs of chronic atopic dermatitis include less redness, increased dryness and early lichenification (thickened skin, hyperpigmentation and accentuation of skin furrows due to repeated rubbing and scratching). Involvement of the back of the arms and the front of the legs is seen first, and later a transition occurs to the elbows and knee folds. Frictional areas such as wrists and ankles are regular sites, and localization may occur to the toes. Occlusive footwear causing excessive sweating and drying of the feet may exacerbate the condition. Children 4–6 years of age usually develop symmetric eczema on flexural areas, hands, feet and the back of the thigh. As the child reaches adulthood, recurrent outbreaks diminish or disappear. In adolescents and adults, the involvement may be generalized, but flexural accentuation is the hallmark of clinical disease. Adults typically exhibit lesions on the face, upper body and flexural areas.​[^[24]]

In addition to the classical patterns, there are site-specific variants. Eyelid eczema is common in 21% of adolescents and is associated with hay fever and exposure to aeroantigens such as house dust mites. The infra-auricular and retro-auricular sites of the ears are particularly prone to fissuring, as a reaction to minor trauma.​[^[3]]

Areas of predisposition may be related to the thickness of the stratum corneum and variations in exposure to irritants and allergens at different body sites: thinnest areas are genitals and eyelids, often subject to rubbing, followed by flexor forearms and posterior auricular.​[^[3]] Other parts of the face and flexures have a thin epidermal barrier with decreased barrier function. In the areas most vulnerable to penetration, the disease persists longer.​[^[3]]

Atopic hand eczema typically involves the volar aspect of the wrists and the dorsum of the hands. It is often present in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis who no longer have dermatitis in typical areas (e.g., flexural).​[^[25]] Concurrent foot eczema has been reported in approximately one-third of patients with atopic hand eczema.​[^[26]]

Other minor features exhibited by atopic patients include recurrent conjunctivitis, cheilitis (chapped lips), infraorbital folds (Dennie-Morgan lines), keratosis pilaris, nipple eczema, recurrent infections (especially viral) and impaired cell-mediated immunity.​[^[22]]​[^[27]] See photo, Atopic Dermatitis.

The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is based on essential and supporting features. Essential features must be present and include pruritus and dermatitis (typical morphology, age-specific features and chronic or relapsing history). Supporting features are present in most cases and include early onset, family history and high IgE reactivity. Other associated features are too nonspecific to be diagnostic. Conditions that should be included in the differential diagnosis are scabies, contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, photosensitivity, immune deficiency and erythroderma due to other causes.​[^[28]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of an infant's neck and lower face. The skin appears to have a red, blotchy rash, which is concentrated around the chin and neck area. The rash is characterized by diffuse redness and small, raised bumps. The skin folds under the chin also show signs of irritation. This type of rash is often associated with conditions like drool rash or eczema, common in infants due to moisture and skin sensitivity. There are no visible labels or annotations in the image.

#### Risk and Aggravating Factors

Table 1 discusses risk factors for development or aggravation of atopic dermatitis.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Genetics | Atopic dermatitis patients have an increased personal or family history of atopic syndrome, including type 1 allergies (immediate hypersensitivity), hay fever, asthma, and chronic allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis and are genetically predisposed (see Pathophysiology).​[28] |
| Environmental allergens | Excessive use of soaps, detergents and shampoos irritate the skin and disturb the skin barrier. Alcohol and astringents in skin-care products can be drying and their use should be limited.​[29] Central heating, insulation, air conditioning and inadequate ventilation may increase exposure to environmental antigens such as house dust mites, moulds, pollens and furry pets. Global warming and increased use of fertilizer may enhance density and allergenic potency of pollen from trees and grains.​[2] The influence of these environmental and lifestyle factors may account for increased incidence in individuals of higher socioeconomic status.​[5] |
| Climate | The influence of climate is shown in people with atopic syndrome who live in humid tropical climates and do not manifest cutaneous symptoms until they move to colder, drier countries.​[2] Seasonal variation in the severity of atopic dermatitis is due to several contributing factors: environmental allergens cause relapses in summer, while climatic influences may cause clearing in the summer sun and worsening in the dry, cold air of winter. Normal skin has water content of 15–20% in the stratum corneum:​[30] dryness of the skin (xerosis) with water content below 10% is crucial for induction of itch and scratching.​[23] Heat worsens the skin condition. |
| Sweating | Any stimulus to sweating (thermal, emotional) is a typical hallmark and the most common trigger of itch. Acetylcholine may be involved and there may be a decreased threshold for sweat stimulation.​[23] |
| Physiologic and psychosocial stress | Stress associated with demanding modern lifestyles appears to enhance skin irritability and contributes to the itch-scratch cycle, sleep disturbances and impaired social functioning.​[2]​[12] The alteration in skin appearance due to scratching escalates the emotional reaction to coping with the disease.​[31] Mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and depression are more common among adults and children with atopic dermatitis than in the general population. This correlation may be influenced by the perceived disease severity and other factors negatively affecting quality of life.​[32]​[33] |
| Dietary influences | Although patients with atopic dermatitis are more likely to have food allergies, food ingestion as a causal factor in atopic dermatitis flares is uncommon. Current evidence does not support eliminating cow's milk from the diet to improve atopic dermatitis. Some evidence suggests that elimination of eggs might benefit patients with atopic dermatitis who have suspected egg allergy and are sensitized to eggs, but more research is needed.​[34]​[35]​[36]​[37]​[38]​[39] See also Nonpharmacologic Therapy. |
| Unbalanced skin microbiome (dysbiosis) | Changes in the natural composition of cutaneous microbial communities, such as loss of diversity, may be linked to chronic inflammatory skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis.​[40]​[41] Preliminary studies show that relative abundance was elevated for Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and reduced for other bacteria. Further research is required to fully characterize the skin microbiome profile in atopic dermatitis.​[41] |
| Irritants | Disinfectants, solvents and allergens in skin-care products play an important role. Issues of irritation extend to clothing fabrics and products. Intolerance to wool is a hallmark of atopy. Coarse-textured fabrics, liquid or sheet fabric softeners (which cause fibres to plump up and stay erect), and bleach should be avoided. Tight clothing or compression stockings (e.g., for venous insufficiency) increase the risk of developing dry skin and worsen existing dry skin through abrasive friction. |
| Infections | Atopic patients have an increased propensity for cutaneous viral infections including herpes simplex; molluscum contagiosum and warts; fungal infections such as dermatophytosis, pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and candidiasis; and bacterial infections such as S. aureus.​[37] S. aureus colonizes >90% of patients. |
| Itch-scratch cycle | Severe pruritus elicits reflexive scratching, resulting in a vicious cycle of itch and scratch. |


#### Contact Dermatitis

#### Clinical Presentation

Cutaneous responses are dependent on the particular chemical, the duration and nature of the contact, and individual host susceptibility. Despite different pathogeneses, the allergic and irritant forms have similar clinical appearances, especially in the chronic forms. The clinical presentation of contact dermatitis is determined by the severity and acuteness of the inflammation. The area involved usually reflects the pattern of the contacting substance and may have sharp, well-demarcated linear margins or unusual geographic shapes. It may spread to distant sites through lymphocytes. Contact substances may be transferred from the primary site by touch to distant areas, especially the eyelids and neck, which are very reactive sites. The face may display a reaction to substances applied to the scalp. Allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis are predominant causes of periorbital dermatitis.​[^[42]] Scalp, palms and sole areas are more resistant. The distribution of the lesions may provide clues to the irritant or allergen trigger.

Acute reactions are often red, edematous papules in the early phase, which become vesicles and bullae that ooze if the reaction is severe enough. Chronic reactions produce an entirely different clinical picture in which primary lesions are minimal, and secondary changes such as dryness, lichenification, pigment changes, hyperkeratosis or thickening, excoriation and fissuring predominate. As with other forms of acute and chronic dermatitis, itching is the primary symptom.​[^[43]]

Irritant Contact Dermatitis: Acute irritant contact dermatitis reactions usually reach their peak within minutes to hours after exposure and then start to heal. Symptoms of an acute reaction to mild irritants include burning, stinging and soreness at the site, and physical signs of the reaction include erythema, vesiculation and oozing. Strong irritants produce blistering, erosions and ulcers. Acute reactions will have sharply demarcated borders and will generally be asymmetrical. Cumulative irritant contact dermatitis is a consequence of multiple subthreshold skin insults without sufficient time in between for complete restoration of skin barrier function. It may be due to a variety of stimuli or frequent repetition of one factor, especially if occupational. Clinical symptoms will develop only after cumulative damage exceeds the threshold, and the lesions may be less well demarcated. Hand dermatitis occurs principally on the fingers, web spaces and dorsa of the hand. Palms are spared, and dryness, erythema and scaling are early features. It often begins on the fourth finger, beneath a ring.​[^[14]] Long-term glove occlusion and the accumulation of barrier damage from hand washing, even when mild hand cleansers are employed, may lead to cumulative skin irritation.​[^[44]]

Allergic Contact Dermatitis: This is a pruritic eczematous reaction which in its mild form is similar to exposure to an irritant. A typical allergic reaction consists of grouped or linear tense vesicles and blisters, and in severe involvement, marked edema, particularly on the face and in periorbital and genital areas. The acute form can also have a diffuse patchy distribution depending on the allergen (for example, body washes and shampoos that get rinsed over the body) and/or the development of disseminated auto-sensitization (acute, generalized dermatitis arising in response to a prior localized inflammatory reaction). The suspected diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, a plausible contact to allergens and a suitable history of dermatitis. A history of clinical improvement or worsening during weekends or holidays may provide clues as to whether the reaction is due to occupational or recreational exposure to allergens. A seasonal variation may indicate photo-aggravation or photoallergy.​[^[45]] Repeated or continued exposure to allergens results in chronic disease. The skin becomes dry, scaly and thicker as a result of acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, edema and cellular infiltration in the dermis. Lichenification and fissuring may develop later. Secondary changes can include excoriation and impetiginization.​[^[45]] Differential diagnoses should be considered only after careful exclusion of any causal contact sensitization. To identify the cause of allergic contact dermatitis, careful diagnosis by patch testing is of great importance. Standard concentrations of known substances are applied to the skin and the reactions monitored. Modifications of the standardized test procedure are the strip patch test and the repeated open application test. Provocative and open use tests may be used after patch testing to distinguish an allergic response from an irritant response. Other tests include prick tests and intradermal tests.​[^[46]]​[^[47]]

#### Common Contact Allergens

A list of contact allergens is presented in Table 2. The most common contact allergens include plants of the *Rhus* genus, nickel, rubber, ethylenediamine (a stabilizer in many topical preparations) and paraphenylenediamine (an ingredient in black hair dye and industrial chemicals).​[^[48]] Nearly any chemical can produce contact dermatitis. Small molecules are most likely to be sensitizers since they penetrate the epidermis more readily. The possibility of cross-sensitization with other chemicals is an important consideration. The most notable are listed in Table 3. Cross-sensitization may prohibit use of critically important systemically administered drugs.​[^[14]]

#### Allergens of Note

####### Plants

***Toxicodendron*** plants, also known as *Rhus* and poison ivy, account for the largest number of cases of allergic contact dermatitis. The typical warning to avoid contact is “Leaflets three, let it be.” The leaves, stems, seeds, flowers, berries and roots of toxicodendron plants contain milky sap that turns into a black varnish-like substance on exposure to air. Once the solvent evaporates, the allergen (urushiol) remains and is antigenic indefinitely, even if the plant has died.​[^[49]] Sensitization is immediate with the formation of a complex protein in the skin. Washing the resin off of the affected area with soap and water up to 2 hours after exposure may help decrease the severity of the reaction. Gentle washing is usually recommended but one small case series showed forceful, unidirectional wiping to be effective.​[^[50]] Sensitization and dermatitis occur after 7–10 days, and re-exposure produces a reaction within 8 hours to 2 days. Streaks of erythema or papules, vesicles, and bullae in linear arrangement are a characteristic clinical presentation and accompany itching and edema as key features.​[^[17]] Urushiol is nonvolatile. Smoke may carry the poison in dispersed form.​[^[49]] See Table 2 and Table 3.

####### Latex

Natural rubber latex, sourced in southeast Asia, is a leading cause of immunologic contact urticaria, and can cause IgE-mediated skin-related findings as well as acute respiratory symptoms and even anaphylaxis. Delayed contact allergy may exist more commonly than previously noted, particularly in atopic individuals. Immediate latex allergy (irritant contact dermatitis) is not the same as the more common, T cell–mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction seen clinically as allergic contact dermatitis.​[^[51]]

Added ingredients to rubber products may cause allergic contact dermatitis: accelerators in the rubber product make it more functional, antioxidants and antiozonants (paraphenylenediamine) delay degradation, and other chemicals increase softness and pliability. Allergic contact dermatitis is due to carbamates and thiurams in rubber gloves, mercaptos, and paraphenylenediamine in shoes, industrial materials and tires, and thioureas in neoprene (used in medical and sporting goods)​[^[51]] (see Table 2 and Table 3).

####### Metals

Metals are the most common contact allergens; nickel is the most common cause of metal allergy, and in most series ranks as the most commonly positive of all screening allergens.​[^[52]] Nickel allergy can result in both cutaneous and systemic manifestations.​[^[53]] Reactions to gold, chrome and cobalt are also frequently seen. Cross-sensitization to other metals can occur, e.g., nickel and palladium. Cobalt, nickel and chromium may induce co-reactions, and other substances may contain them (cobalt in cement). Usually, the metals must be in solution for allergic contact, but can be liberated by sweat. Nickel, palladium and titanium are the most common metal allergens in contact dermatitis due to eyeglass frames.​[^[54]] Metals can also be ingested (dietary nickel) or due to sources such as orthopedic implants.​[^[52]] Irritant contact dermatitis to metals is common in workers exposed to metal salts, dust or fumes.​[^[52]]

####### Antibiotics

Topical antibiotics used long-term on skin with impaired protective barrier leads to increased risk of hypersensitivity. Groups at a high risk of contact sensitivity include patients with chronic venous insufficiency, chronic ulcers or chronic otitis externa, or individuals with occupational exposure to antibiotics (e.g., human medicine and veterinary medicine practitioners, pharmaceutical industry workers, cattle breeders). When long-term therapy with topical antibiotics in these patients fails to result in improvement, allergic reactions to topical antibiotics should be considered. Cross-sensitivity, which is frequently associated with topical aminoglycoside antibiotics, poses a significant problem.​[^[55]]

Bacitracin is an antibiotic used in several types of consumer products, including cosmetics and ophthalmic and skin ointments. Bacitracin was the ninth most-common contact allergen detected in 2003, causing more than 9% of positive reactions among 5812 patients with suspected contact dermatitis.​[^[56]] Because bacitracin is used on wounds and is often inappropriately applied to fungal infections, the diagnosis of contact dermatitis can often be elusive. Reactions may be attributed to a slow-healing wound or worsening infection that is treated, ironically, with more topical antibiotic agents. Due to the significant prevalence of bacitracin allergy, the American Contact Dermatitis Society warns it should not be used routinely.​[^[56]] Clinical effect, scientific evidence and need for medical cost containment all advocate the discontinuation of routine usage of bacitracin in clean wounds.

####### Antihistamines

Topical antihistamines have been reported to cause contact dermatitis. Doxepin cream was the most commonly implicated topical preparation in one review​[^[57]] but there are case reports for others including topical diphenhydramine. A causal relationship is often difficult to recognize because the reaction may be similar to the disease being treated with the antihistamine preparation. Cross-reactivity within the same class of medication is likely but not certain.

####### Preservatives

Many preservatives can cause allergic contact dermatitis (e.g., parabens, formaldehyde). Methylisothiazolinone is a preservative commonly found in baby wipes. Incidence of allergy to this chemical is rising with increasing use and some jurisdictions are calling for a ban on its use. It has been suggested that it is common enough to be included in the standardized series of allergens used in patch testing.​[^[58]] In Canada, concentration of methylisothiazolinone used alone is limited to 100 ppm; however, this is 25 times the limit allowed when it is used in combination with methylchloroisothiazolinone (see Diaper Dermatitis for more information).​[^[59]]

####### Surfactants

Alkyl glucosides are important contact allergens that are plant-derived nonionic surfactants. Their use in products intended for daily use (e.g., facial moisturizers, sunscreens) is increasing due to their biodegradable nature.​[^[60]] Sorbitan sesquioleate and/or sorbitan monooleate are emulsifiers used in many topical corticosteroid products. One study and its follow-up found incidence rates for allergic contact dermatitis of 8.9% and 4.1%, respectively, due to these chemicals. The authors suggest that given the presence of sorbitans in many topical corticosteroid formulations, allergy to these chemicals should be considered when patients do not improve as expected with topical corticosteroid therapy.​[^[61]]

####### Others

Excipients such as propylene glycol, lanolin or colorants can also be responsible for cases of allergic contact dermatitis. Learning to read the labels of cosmetic or personal-care products is important for patients with a history of contact sensitivity.​[^[62]]​[^[63]]

It is possible to develop an allergic sensitivity to corticosteroid preparations themselves, which appears paradoxical due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the corticosteroids (see Pharmacologic Therapy, Topical Corticosteroids).

#### Risk and Aggravating Factors

Table 5 discusses risk factors for development or aggravation of contact dermatitis.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Consort contact dermatitis | Skin-to-skin contact can result in transfer of potential contact allergens from one sex partner to the other and may result from lubricants, hygiene products, seminal fluids, and rubber in diaphragms and condoms.​[20] |
| Impaired cell-mediated immunity | Risk is reduced with impairment of cell-mediated immunity, such as AIDS, lymphomas or atopic dermatitis. Atopic patients are more likely to develop pustular reactions when exposed to nickel.​[20] |
| Diet | It has been suggested that diet may play a role in allergic contact dermatitis. Approximately 30–50% of patients with latex allergy have hypersensitivity to certain fruits. Presence in food of nickel (e.g., from water, cooking utensils) or balsam of Peru (e.g., wine, candy, chocolate, curry) can aggravate allergic contact dermatitis; eliminating these items from the diet may alleviate symptoms.​[64] |
| Race | The incidence of contact dermatitis in White patients is greater than in Black patients due to their greater skin reactivity; however, Black patients experience a higher incidence of paraphenylenediamine allergy. White patients have a looser packing of skin layers and fewer intercellular lipids, making their skin more permeable to irritants and allergens.​[65] |
| Gender | Although women develop contact dermatitis more often than men, it is primarily because women are more frequently exposed to irritants, allergens, and wet work, and not because of differences in skin reactivity.​[65] |
| Genetics | Twin studies indicate that genetic factors other than atopy (e.g., cytokine gene polymorphisms) may influence susceptibility to irritant contact dermatitis. Individuals with a low threshold for the irritant effect of sodium lauryl sulfate and benzalkonium chloride have a high prevalence of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha gene polymorphism that is correlated with increased TNF-alpha production.​[66] |
| Body site | Eyelid contact dermatitis may be due to mascara, cosmetic preservatives, nail polish, hair cosmetics, eyeliner, ophthalmic medications, adhesives in false eyelashes, eyelash curlers, paper products, plants, airborne materials and dyes. The chest and abdomen are sites for allergy to metals and elastic objects, and genital areas are susceptible to dermatitis from hygiene products, contraceptives, condoms and seminal fluid. Nails exhibit contact dermatitis from acrylate applications, hardeners, enamels, hydroquinone in bleaching creams, weed killers, insecticides and physical trauma.​[67] |
| Occupation | Individuals at risk of contact dermatitis are often those who are exposed to these substances occupationally or as part of their daily routine. Exposure to organic solvents together with detergents may increase the risk of acquiring occupational contact dermatitis.​[68] Rhus dermatitis is seen more commonly in younger persons, and is a hazard for outdoor workers and enthusiasts. Latex allergy (from rubber gloves and other sources) is common in health-care practitioners. The medical community is also at risk of contact dermatitis due to occupational substances including mucolytics, dressings, adhesive removers, gowns, scrub solutions, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, mercury (dentists) as well as active drugs such as anesthetics, essential oils, antibiotics, and inactive ingredients including aluminum, petrolatum, oils (olive, castor and sesame) and lanolin.​[69] Other occupations that can increase the risk of contact dermatitis include photography, textile work, printing industry, agricultural work, office work (carbon sources), bakery work and hairdressing.​[70] Hand dermatitis as a subtype of contact dermatitis is often seen in health-care practitioners, hairdressers and dishwashers, especially in those who have atopic dermatitis. Susceptibility is greater among younger people. Bakers and chefs may experience food contact dermatitis due to sorbic acid preservatives, antioxidants, flavour ingredients (peppermint, cinnamon, anise, coriander, garlic, sesame, cashew), food additives (such as dyes) and benzoyl peroxide.​[71] Plant allergy may include extracts used in medications such as balsam of Peru, rosin and benzoin.​[72] |
| Ultraviolet light | Photocontact dermatitis requires exposure to UV light and may occur due to irritant or allergic causes. Irritant reactions (phototoxic) can occur in anyone due to substances like psoralens, whereas photoallergic contact dermatitis occurs only after an individual with sensitivities is exposed to an allergen. Fragrances and sunscreen chemicals are causes of photocontact dermatitis.​[73] |
| Climate | Seasonal variation occurs with increased prevalence during winter months and exposure to cold, dry air.​[48] |


#### Stasis Dermatitis

#### Clinical Presentation

Stasis dermatitis, which occurs due to venous insufficiency, is seen on the lower leg. Acute changes consist of inflammation, erythema, edema, pigmentation and ulceration. The eruption may be erythematous and oozing, with marked inflammation. Chronic stasis results in scaling, discoloration and lichenification and is accompanied by edema due to venous disease. This may result in fibrosis, producing hardening and induration of soft tissue. Pigmentation is invariably present in the early stages due to dermal extravasation of red blood cells following small venule rupture. Superficial ulceration may result from acute inflammation and may heal or progress to deeper ulcers. Superficial venous varicosities may also be present.​[^[14]]

#### Differentiating Features of Atopic, Contact and Stasis Dermatitis

Table 7 outlines the differentiating features of common dermatitis subtypes.

| Condition | Body Location | Description | Trigger Factors | Goals of Therapy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Atopic dermatitis | Age <6 months–2 y: chest, face, neck, diaper area | Cycles of itching and scratching. Red, raised blisters with oozing, dry skin | Extreme heat or cold, rapid temperature changes, sweating, irritant or occlusive clothing (wool or nylon), soaps and detergents, greases, environmental allergens, anxiety, infections | Decrease trigger factors and pruritusSuppress inflammationLubricate skinAlleviate anxiety |
|  | Age >2–4 y: scalp, neck, extremities |  |  |  |
|  | Age >4–10 y: scattered—neck, wrist, elbow, knee | Less acute and oozing; dry papules, thickening, periorbital edema and erythema |  |  |
|  | Adolescents and adults: flexor areas, hands | Dry, thickened, hyperpigmented plaques |  |  |
| Contact dermatitis (irritant and allergic) | Irritant/allergic: in contact areaAllergic: may generalize | Unusual patterns resembling contacting substanceAcute: red, blisters, oozing, may erodeChronic: dry, thick, fissured | Irritant: time and concentration of irritantAllergic: sensitization to allergen | Decrease contact exposure to irritants and allergensIf dry, wet itIf wet, dry it |
| Dry skin | Lower legs (shins); dorsa of hands, forearms | Mild to moderate: dry skin with fine scale; diffuse or round patchesSevere: cracks and fissures in diamond pattern with redness | Increasing age; decreased humidity; increased indoor heat; cold, dry, winter air; contact with soaps and irritants; hypothyroidism | Replace water in the skin and the environment |
| Hand dermatitis | Irritant: sides of the fingers, less often throughout palmsAllergic: back of the hands | Redness, dryness, chapping; small vesicles; excess sweating | Repeated contact with primary irritants, soap and water, solvents and detergentsFamily history of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis | Decrease contact exposure |
| Stasis dermatitis | Any part of lower leg, but most commonly, proximal to medial malleolus | Acute: inflammation, edema, pigmentation and ulcerationChronic: scaling, discoloration, lichenification | Venous insufficiency and edema; upright posture; hot, humid environment; sensitizers | Decrease triggers; bed rest and elevation; compression of leg |


#### Drug-Induced Dermatitis

Eczematous eruptions can also occur due to the topical application of medications (contact dermatitis) or systemic administration of medications (drug-induced skin reactions). Cross-sensitivity may occur with structurally related drugs administered by either route. Common sensitizers include antibiotics, phenothiazines and the ester group of anesthetics. As a rule, the eruption starts shortly after administration of the drug, if previous sensitization has occurred. Patch testing with the responsible drug will give positive results. Table 8 lists drugs that commonly evoke eczematous reactions.​[^[74]] More information can be found in Drug-Induced Skin Reactions.

#### Severe or Complicated Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis that is acute and vesicular or moderate to severe (defined as: generalized to more than 30% of the body surface area [BSA], continues to involve larger body areas, remains unresponsive, becomes secondarily infected or interferes with activities of daily life or sleep patterns) requires further assessment and treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner. Parameters for assessing severity of atopic dermatitis include Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI)​[^[77]] score (a tool used to measure the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis in order to assess clinical response to treatment), quality of life measurement tools (e.g., Dermatology Life Quality Index),​[^[77]] sleep disturbances, itch (diary), redness, scale, dryness and amount of emollient used. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, an appropriate health-care practitioner should be consulted.​[^[78]]

Contact or stasis dermatitis that spreads to distant sites or becomes generalized to more than 30% of BSA, is acute and nonresponsive within a few days, includes edema that persists or increases within a few days, is chronic and nonresponsive within 7–10 days or interferes with quality of life is considered severe or complicated and requires further assessment and treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner. 

Complicated dermatitis due to secondary infection can occur because disruption of the epidermal barrier by inflammation and the resultant scratching predisposes the skin to entry of bacteria. S. aureus and S. pyogenes are the most frequent causes of superficial (impetiginization) or deep (cellulitis or erysipelas) superinfection of dermatitis.​[^[79]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

#### Atopic and Contact Dermatitis

Patient **education** is a critical component of the management of atopic dermatitis. A systematic review has shown that structured education programs may lead to improvements in disease severity and quality of life.​[^[80]]

**Avoidance** of irritants and aggravating factors is key. A thorough history is essential to identify the cause, especially any previous treatments that may have exacerbated symptoms or cross-reacted with the irritant or allergen.

**Environmental factors** that can modulate the effect of irritants include temperature, humidity and texture of fabrics. Intense sun exposure should be avoided. Temperature in home and work environments should be temperate with moderate humidity to minimize sweating and reduce problems related to heat and perspiration. Air conditioning in the summer and a cool air humidifier in the winter may be helpful. If a humidifier is not available, a bowl of water in the room will enhance ambient humidity.

New **clothing** should be laundered prior to wearing to remove formaldehyde and other chemicals.​[^[29]] Occlusive clothing should be avoided and loose-fitting cotton or cotton blend garments substituted for nylon, and corduroy for wool. Many blended fabrics are well tolerated. Texture or roughness, rather than fabric type (natural vs. synthetic) determine tolerability and skin irritancy.​[^[29]]​[^[81]]​[^[82]] Liquid fabric softeners or dryer sheets should be avoided because plumping up fibres and making them erect increases irritancy. Bleach in the rinse also irritates and should be avoided. A diluted vinegar rinse can be substituted. Use of liquid rather than powder detergent can result in more complete rinsing; adding a second rinse cycle may facilitate removal of residual powder detergent.

**Swimming** may be a better tolerated sport than those involving intense perspiration or physical contact and may improve dermatitis. Bathing may also remove allergens from the skin surface and reduce colonization by S. aureus. Despite a drying or irritating effect, swimming in chlorinated pools results in clinical improvement in some atopic patients. Rather than simply rinsing off after swimming, gentle cleansers should be used to effectively remove the chlorine or bromine, and then moisturizer should be applied.​[^[29]]

Wearing **cotton gloves** or **mittens** prevents scratching and secondary infections and allows healing of affected hands. They can be used as a barrier against irritants such as newsprint when reading the paper, and can also allow children to play or perform normal activities, with good acceptance. Keeping fingernails clean and short is essential.

A **diet** that excludes specific foods is not recommended for patients with atopic dermatitis without a confirmed food allergy.​[^[78]] Intervention is indicated in only about 10–15% of atopic children, when the disease is of sufficient severity and there is a strong suspicion that certain food(s) aggravate the condition. Restrictions in diet should not have a greater effect on quality of life than the disease. Risks of dietary restriction must be kept in mind: such diets may lead to malnutrition and deficiencies, carry the risk of anaphylactic reactions upon rechallenge to a restricted food, and challenge the psychological and social well-being of the child.​[^[12]] If foods aggravate atopic dermatitis, they represent only a fraction of the expression of the disease. Exclusion of foods in pregnancy or breastfeeding to prevent development of atopic dermatitis is not recommended.​[^[78]] The benefit of breastfeeding is recognized; patients should be advised that exclusive breastfeeding for the first 3 months or more may help prevent the development of atopic dermatitis where there is a family history of atopy.​[^[29]] Hydrolyzed formulas should not be offered to infants in preference to breast milk for prevention of atopic dermatitis. The introduction of any specific solid food (soft, mashed consistency to prevent choking) should not be delayed beyond 6 months of age. Later introduction of peanut, fish or egg does not prevent, and may even increase, the risk of developing food allergy. Skin or specific IgE blood testing before a first ingestion is discouraged due to the high false-positive rate. Regular ingestion (several times weekly) of newly introduced foods is important to maintain tolerance.​[^[83]] Maternal use of probiotics during pregnancy and maternal and/or infant use during breastfeeding may be helpful in reducing the development of atopic dermatitis in the child.​[^[84]]​[^[85]]​[^[86]]​[^[87]] Strain and dose of probiotic is not consistent across studies. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of probiotics for treatment of established eczema.​[^[88]]​[^[89]]

**Wet dressing solutions** used in atopic and contact dermatitis may include ordinary tap water or saline, in addition to pharmacologic solutions containing astringent and/or antiseptic compounds. The action of a wet dressing is primarily physical, and thus water or physiologic saline are the solutions of choice as they are convenient, inexpensive and pose no problems of sensitivity or damage to healing wounds. Note that the technique used in applying wet dressings determines the effect on the skin: used as compresses, they are drying, whereas used as soaks, they are hydrating. The general rule for application of wet dressings is “If it is wet, dry it (compress); if it is dry, wet it (soak).”

**Wet dressings as compresses** cool and dry the skin through evaporation. They reduce inflammatory blood flow, cleanse the skin of exudates, crusts and debris and help maintain drainage of infected areas through vasoconstriction. They are indicated in acute eczematous conditions with oozing and crusting, which can be seen in atopic or contact dermatitis. The solution should be tepid or room temperature, although cold solution is effective in relieving itch in skin that is otherwise not symptomatic. A nonirritating gauze or thin cloth is soaked with solution, then wrung gently so it remains wet but not dripping. The compress is applied to the skin, removed, remoistened and reapplied every few minutes for 20–30 minute periods, 4–6 times daily (“a minute on, a minute off”). After removal, a lotion may be applied to the skin, but avoid occlusion with an ointment. Powders are not applied to any exudative lesion as they crust, causing bleeding on removal and increased risk of infection.

**Wet dressings as soaks** soften hardened crusts in scaling conditions usually apparent in chronic atopic or contact dermatitis, and can hydrate the skin. To apply a soak, saturate the cloth and apply to the area for 15–20 minutes without removal. This procedure occludes and breaks down underlying tissue. Soaks are never used for acute, exudating dermatitis as they may macerate the skin, further damaging barrier function. Chronic contact dermatitis that is dry or fissured should be soaked for 5 minutes rather than compressed before application of an occlusive emollient.

**Wet-wrap therapy** with or without a topical corticosteroid can be recommended for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and/or recalcitrant disease to decrease disease severity and water loss during flares. It may be performed on an ambulatory or inpatient basis. Most use a technique of a topical agent covered by a wetted first layer of tubular bandages, gauze or a cotton suit followed by a dry second/outside layer. For more generalized disease, 2 layers of nonirritating clothing can be similarly prepared. The rationale includes occluding the topical agent for increased penetration, decreasing water loss and providing a physical barrier against scratching. The wrap can be worn for several hours, up to 24 hours at a time, depending on patient tolerance. Most suggest several days of use, although a few studies continued for up to 2 weeks. Use of topical corticosteroids under the wet wraps seems to be more efficacious than using only moisturizers with the wraps. Care should be taken if mid- to higher-potency corticosteroids are applied under the wraps, as absorption is increased and may cause hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, especially if used widely on the skin. Temporary decreases in early morning serum cortisol levels have been reported, although short courses of use have not been associated with prolonged adrenal suppression. The potential for increased risk of infection has been raised with the use of mid- to higher-potency topical corticosteroids in wet-wrap therapy, although the data are sparse and conflicting regarding its actual occurrence.​[^[90]]

 In the case of atopic dermatitis, control of trigger factors and anxiety is a major strategy. Control of exposure to environmental inhaled allergens is important. Direct contact with allergens and irritants should be reduced. Limit soap cleansing to axillae and groin, using mild soaps, creams or soapless cleansers (see Table 10). Restrict showers to once weekly, if possible. Use bathing to rehydrate the skin and follow with a liberal use of emollients to prevent evaporation. Water temperature should be warm, not hot.

If contact dermatitis is acute, some principles should be kept in mind: the affected area should be washed immediately and thoroughly. If wet or oozing, compresses with saline or tap water should be applied (1 minute on, 1 minute off for 20–30 minutes) 4–6 times daily. Protect the damaged skin against secondary infection until the acute stage subsides. Do not allow debris due to oozing, scaling and crusting to accumulate (see Nonpharmacologic Therapy, Wet Dressings).

Patients with contact dermatitis should remove rings when washing hands, as trapped soap may produce flares. Use an unscented soap or hand cleanser free of colour, antiseptics, deodorants, vitamins and tar. Wash hands with lukewarm water and use soap sparingly. Rinse hands thoroughly and dry with clean towel, especially between fingers. Wash as infrequently as possible, no more than 2–3 times daily. Hands can be protected with plastic or vinyl gloves worn with cotton liners, but rubber gloves should be avoided. In hand dermatitis, avoid activity that involves friction, pressure, squeezing or twisting. A low nickel diet for vesicular hand dermatitis can be helpful in select nickel-sensitive cases.​[^[91]] Avoid adhesive bandages. Chronic hand dermatitis often becomes secondarily infected, especially if fissured, and should be managed appropriately. Despite lack of evidence, anecdotally, small, noninfected fissures can be closed with cyanoacrylate glue (e.g., Super Glue). Occlusive dressings such as kitchen plastic wrap (overnight) may expedite healing.

#### Stasis Dermatitis

Local treatment of stasis dermatitis varies with the state of inflammation. Apply only those topical medications considered essential, as patients with stasis dermatitis are readily sensitized; 80% of patients with chronic stasis dermatitis are at risk of contact dermatitis. Ointment bases are the most common inciting agents.​[^[92]]

Nonpharmacologic management of stasis dermatitis is similar to that of other acute eczematous conditions. Wet dressings can be used as compresses to cool and dry weeping skin through evaporation. Wet dressings can also be used as soaks to soften hardened crusts or scaling and increase skin hydration in chronic stasis dermatitis.

The reduction of edema is important and achieved through bed rest and elevation of the extremity in addition to optimization of medications if applicable. After edema subsides, compressive support in the form of an elastic bandage or stocking should be applied unless patients have compromised peripheral arterial circulation. After the dermatitis is healed, advise the life-long use of elastic compression stockings.​[^[14]]

#### Atopic and Contact Dermatitis

##### Bath Products

In most dermatitis conditions, dryness at some stage initiates or exacerbates the symptoms. The primary means of correcting dryness is to add water to the skin and then to apply a hydrophobic substance to keep it there. The benefits of hydration and moisturizers to help restore and maintain normal barrier function cannot be overemphasized. Since wet skin is more permeable to water, it is essential that the skin be covered within the first few minutes to prevent evaporation. Appropriate use of hydration together with occlusive bases or moisturizers will help re-establish and maintain the skin's barrier function. Bathing can have differing effects on the skin depending on the manner in which it is carried out. Bathing with water can hydrate the skin and remove scale, crust, irritants and allergens, which can be helpful for patients with atopic dermatitis. However, if the water is left to evaporate from the skin, greater transepidermal water loss occurs.​[^[93]] Bathing is suggested for patients with atopic dermatitis as part of treatment and maintenance; however, there is no standard for the frequency or duration of bathing appropriate for atopic dermatitis. However, it is generally recommended that up to once-daily bathing be performed to remove serous crust; the duration should be limited to short periods of time (e.g., 5–10 minutes) with use of warm water. Moisturizers should be applied soon after bathing to improve skin hydration. Hydration of the face or neck can be achieved by applying a wet washcloth or towel to the involved area. Isolated areas such as hands and feet can be treated with soaks in basins. For the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis, there is insufficient evidence for clear recommendations on the addition of oils, emollients and most other additives to bath water, or the use of acidic spring water.​[^[94]]

It has historically been thought that bath oils applied during or after bathing may help to reduce the rate of water loss through the epidermis; however, a good-quality RCT found that adding emollients to bath water did not result in any significant clinical improvement in atopic dermatitis compared to bathing without emollients.​[^[95]] Bath additives are less effective than lotions and creams applied directly to wet skin since they are diluted with water and are in contact with the skin for a short time period, and most of the deposited oil is wiped off when towel drying. If added at the beginning of the bath, they may prevent rather than enhance hydration and thus should be added near the end of the bath to trap water in the skin. Bath oils give a false sense of lubrication and can make the bathtub slippery. Most bath oils combine mineral or vegetable oils with surfactants that disperse oil through the bath. Concentrations of surfactants (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate) above 4% reduce the affinity of oil for the skin. Avoid products with fragrance and lanolin. Oil used as a single ingredient will float on top of the water. Bath oil capsules enclose small amounts of oil in soft, flexible gelatin capsules that dissolve in hot water but may necessitate a higher water temperature than desirable and often contain a higher percentage of fragrance. **Olive oil** is an inexpensive natural product that may be applied directly to rehydrated skin after bathing.

Avoid **bath salts**. They are highly fragranced and soften water by raising the alkalinity. This may cause itching or redness on sensitive skin. Avoid detergent bubble baths if skin is dry or itchy.

Colloidal oatmeal preparations contain starch and protein and are effective antipruritics. Addition of oatmeal products may be soothing but does not promote increased water absorption. For dry skin, they are not as effective as oils in trapping water to maintain hydration unless the oilated versions are used. Bathing in colloidal oatmeal baths is useful when large body areas are involved.​[^[91]]

Excessive washing may remove lipids and water that normally keep the stratum corneum soft and pliable. It is postulated that maintaining the skin surface at its physiological pH (4–6.5) during cleansing prevents overgrowth of certain micro-organisms such as Cutibacterium acnes (formerly *Propionibacterium acnes*). Avoid use of any cleansing products on acutely inflamed skin. For intact skin, the use of cleansing products should be kept to a minimum and not involve any rubbing or massaging of the skin. Sufficient water should be used to rinse away all traces of cleansing products.

**Soaps** are made from animal or vegetable fat and alkali and consist of surfactants that interact with stratum corneum proteins and lipids in a manner that causes damage, dry skin and irritation. Most soaps are alkaline in pH, whereas the skin’s normal pH is 4–5.5. Fatty acid plus sodium or potassium hydroxide produce a water-soluble soap. Toilet soaps are usually made from palmitic, stearic or oleic acids. Hard sodium soaps are suitable for bars, flakes and powders while more soluble potassium soaps are used for liquid preparations. Softer and more water-soluble, **transparent soaps** (or glycerin soaps) do not last long or lather well. They claim to be less drying or irritating than alkaline **opaque soaps**. However, objective clinical evaluations are lacking.

**Soapless cleansers** are surfactants and synthetic detergents often recommended for better tolerance, although this is based on only a few clinical studies. They lack lipid/fat and are available in lotion and gel forms. Soapless lotions can be applied liberally and have a foaming action. Removed gently, they leave a thin film on the skin to aid in water retention. No good evidence demonstrates that addition of neutral fats or cold cream to the soapless cleanser further enhances its moisturizing effect. It is improbable that a simple cleansing agent can achieve the 2 opposing tasks (cleansing of the skin and deposition of fat on the skin), especially since the cleanser is rinsed off. Avoid products with harsh surfactants (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate [SLS] and alkyl phosphates) as these strip the skin of its natural moisturizing factor. Recommend those with mild surfactants such as sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI), sodium lauryl ether sulfates (SLES) and those that contain emollients (e.g., cetyl alcohol) and/or humectants (e.g., glycerin) (see Table 10).

##### Barrier/Protectant Products

Some topical products are used as “barriers” or protectants for patients with dermatitis, particularly in the occupational setting. These often contain silicone and/or zinc-related compounds. The protective efficacy of barrier creams depends on the amount of product applied per unit skin surface area. The actual amounts applied and the resulting dose per unit area have been reported to be lower than recommended. Some products may show no protective efficacy when used at doses close to those practically applied at workplaces.​[^[96]] In one study, 2 of 6 protective creams failed to prevent solvent-induced cumulative skin irritation.​[^[97]] A systematic review found barrier creams to have a clinically important protective effect when used in combination with moisturizers, but not when used alone.​[^[98]]

##### Moisturizers

Breakdown of the skin barrier, the first event in the development of atopic dermatitis, results in xerosis (dry skin), one of the cardinal clinical features. This provides a rationale for the use of a complete moisturizing therapy regimen to combat xerosis and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in atopic dermatitis and related skin barrier breakdown conditions such as irritant contact dermatitis.​[^[99]] Barrier damage is directly correlated to the severity of dermatitis. The main purpose of moisturizer therapy is to restore the epidermal barrier, which is composed of corneocytes, extracellular proteins, and a lipid-rich matrix (ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol). Use of moisturizers leads to improved integrity of the epidermal barrier and a consequent reduction of both TEWL and penetration of irritant substances. There is no reliable evidence that one moisturizer is better than another.​[^[100]]

Patients with atopic dermatitis require ongoing moisturizer therapy. Clinical trials have shown that they lessen symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis, including pruritus, erythema, fissuring and lichenification.​[^[94]] Moisturizers can themselves result in some reduction in inflammation and atopic dermatitis severity. There is strong evidence that their use can also reduce the need for pharmacologic intervention, including topical corticosteroids, and that the combination of topical corticosteroids plus moisturizers is more effective than the use of topical corticosteroids alone.​[^[100]] Moisturizers are first-line therapy for mild disease and an important part of the treatment regimen for moderate and severe disease. They also play a key role in maintenance treatment as they have been shown to prolong time to flare and reduce the number of flares.​[^[94]]​[^[100]]

The use of moisturizers alone or combined with the use of barrier creams may play a clinically important role in the primary prevention of occupational irritant hand dermatitis.​[^[98]] Antioxidant creams have been shown to effectively protect the skin from chemical-induced irritation.​[^[101]] Unfortunately low adherence to skin protective measures that combine creams and other approaches has been reported after 1 year.​[^[102]]

Moisturizers are generally classified by their mechanism of action as emollients, occlusives or humectants. Newer agents containing ceramides, may be classed as barrier repair agents.

Emollients are semisolid bases designed to control dryness by slowing evaporation and lubricating the stratum corneum. They fill the cracks between clusters of desquamating corneocytes. They may contain colloidal oatmeal, glycol, glyceryl stearate, shea butter and soy sterols, which lubricate and soften the skin. These products cannot keep skin soft and flexible without the required concentration of water in the skin, and function only to trap existing moisture. Very little water from emollients is absorbed by the skin; most water in emollients evaporates when the product is applied and therefore they should be applied while the skin is still damp from bathing (usually within 3–5 minutes). Emollients include lotions, creams and ointments. Most are oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions. The higher the oil content, the greater the occlusion and the less drying through evaporation. Ointments (e.g., petrolatum) are therefore the most occlusive and have the fewest additives, though in a hot, humid environment their use may lead to trapping of sweat with subsequent irritation of the skin. Users may not tolerate oil or water-in-oil products because the greasy texture increases discomfort. Greasy applications are unsuitable for acute oozing dermatitis. In contrast, evaporating water from oil-in-water creams or more liquid oil-in-water lotions produces a cooling effect, which alleviates pruritus. A smaller amount of oil content is left as a residual film to protect hydration. Lotions contain more water than creams and may be drying due to the effects of evaporation. Obtain products in the largest size available because they usually need to be applied several times a day on a long-term basis.

Scrutinize the emollient product for other ingredients, as some preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers and fragrances may aggravate atopic, allergic or stasis dermatitis (e.g., lanolin, parabens, cresols, sodium lauryl sulfate, cetylstearyl alcohols and fragrance). Choose an emollient for its drying or lubricating properties as suitable for the stage of dermatitis. For an acute, wet dermatitis that has been compressed, apply a lotion after oozing stops, to facilitate dryness. In less acute, drier dermatitis, an oil-in-water emulsion base is appropriate. In chronic, very dry or scaly dermatitis, a water-in-oil emulsion gives maximum lubrication. Hairy areas may require gels or lotions.

**Occlusive agents** (petrolatum, dimethicone, mineral oil) form a layer on the skin that retards evaporation of water. Depending on the vehicle, occlusives generally require fewer applications than creams or lotions. Petrolatum provides an occlusive effect but is cosmetically unacceptable as it feels greasy and does not wash off easily. It is sometimes used as a sealer after hydrating the skin; however, it is effective only when used in conjunction with hydration. Due to its highly occlusive properties, it can cause maceration and overgrowth of bacteria or yeast if used on acutely inflamed and oozing lesions. Petrolatum is discussed further as an alternative for diaper dermatitis (see Diaper Dermatitis).



Recognition of the role of disrupted ceramide content in barrier dysfunction led to the development of barrier repair therapies that aim to restore appropriate ceramide balance. In one study, a ceramide-dominant product was as effective as a mid-potency topical corticosteroid after 28 days.​[^[107]] The use of barrier repair products containing key stratum corneum lipids, including ceramides, may make it possible to reduce the use of topical corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.

##### Tar Preparations

Topical coal tar derivatives have been used for many years in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Coal tar activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–signalling pathway, resulting in enhanced epidermal differentiation, increased levels of filaggrin, and inhibition of a major atopic dermatitis cytokine pathway.​[^[108]] Prior to the widespread use of corticosteroids, crude coal tar extracts were used to reduce inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Despite limited evidence of efficacy, tar preparations​[^[94]] may be used to reduce the need for corticosteroids in chronic maintenance therapy of atopic dermatitis. Their effect is not felt to be as potent as corticosteroids but they are long-lasting with few side effects. Coal tar is primarily used in scalp preparations, compounded in cream bases that are generally used at night to increase adherence. Patients should cover their head with a shower cap to limit staining, and rinse out in the morning. Coal tar products should not be used on inflamed skin due to irritating effects. Cosmetically, they are less acceptable due to staining and unpleasant smell.​[^[29]]

##### Topical Corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for atopic dermatitis and first-line treatment for patients with allergic contact dermatitis. They reduce inflammation and pruritus and are useful for both the acute and chronic phases of atopic and contact dermatitis. Their mechanism is complex, affecting multiple resident and infiltrating cells primarily by suppressing inflammatory genes.

A large number of topical corticosteroids are available, ranging in potency from low to extremely high. A variety of factors should be considered when choosing a particular topical corticosteroid, including patient age, areas of the body to which the medication will be applied, and other patient factors such as degree of xerosis, patient preference, and cost of medication. Low-potency choices are recommended for areas of thinner skin (particularly the face and eyelids) and high-potency products are indicated for thickened and lichenified lesions in other locations. Choice of vehicle for the corticosteroid is also important. Vehicles include lotions, solutions, gels, sprays, foams, and oils. In general, ointments are considered more potent and more occlusive and contain less preservatives than creams and lotions. Creams are better tolerated in excessive heat or humidity; lotions are less effective and contribute to xerosis. Solutions are used on the scalp or hairy areas, but the alcohol content may irritate inflamed or excoriated lesions.

As a general rule, the lowest potency corticosteroid that is effective should be used. Therapy should not exceed a 2-week course. Lack of response to low-potency agents such as **hydrocortisone** may indicate the need for stronger corticosteroids except on the face and in skin folds, where low-potency agents like hydrocortisone remain the drugs of choice.​[^[109]]​[^[110]] Using a topical corticosteroid too low in potency may sometimes result in persistence or worsening of atopic dermatitis. In such cases, after a 2-week trial, institute a stepped-care approach, beginning with a mid-to-high potency corticosteroid until control is achieved, and then reducing to a lower-potency agent. Discontinuing a mid- to high-potency corticosteroid without tapering to a lower-potency corticosteroid may result in rebound flaring of atopic dermatitis. Some patients may not respond to corticosteroid therapy due to superinfection.​[^[29]] When topical corticosteroids are used, any coexisting infection should be treated promptly.

Application of topical corticosteroids to wet skin has not been demonstrated to be better than application to dry skin for children with atopic dermatitis.​[^[111]] However, in cases where topical corticosteroid alone is inadequate, this ‘‘soak and smear’’ technique may improve response.​[^[94]]​[^[112]] Severe or complicated dermatitis may require treatment with stronger corticosteroids. Resistant cases may sometimes respond to the addition of occlusion to the application of the corticosteroid, but this approach should be used with caution and is generally reserved for dermatitis of the hands or feet.

Patients with atopic dermatitis should be advised to continue with moisturizer therapy during treatment with topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids should be used once daily, although if insufficient for control, twice daily can be used. Twice-weekly maintenance therapy is recommended in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experiencing frequent relapses and is more effective than use of moisturizers alone for prevention of flares.​[^[94]] There is insufficient evidence to know whether it is more beneficial to apply moisturizers before or after topical corticosteroids. A small, randomized study showed no difference over 2 weeks between patients who applied moisturizer before topical corticosteroids and those who did the reverse.​[^[113]] Many sources suggest moisturizer be applied 30 minutes before a topical corticosteroid but this is based on low-level evidence or consensus recommendations and is not universally accepted. Practicality and patient adherence are key factors to consider when deciding on order of application.​[^[114]]

Physical examination for cutaneous side effects is recommended during long-term, potent corticosteroid therapy. Consider the potential for both topical and systemic side effects, including possible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, particularly in children. Patient fears of side effects associated with the use of topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis should be recognized and addressed to improve adherence and avoid undertreatment. Despite widespread use, with correct education, adverse effects are infrequent with appropriately used mid- to high-potency corticosteroids. Over time, antiproliferative effects (e.g., skin thinning), poor wound healing, hypopigmentation, secondary infections and acne may occur, particularly on the face and in the intertriginous areas. Perioral dermatitis may occur on the face, characterized by erythema, scaling and follicular papules and pustules around the mouth or eye creases. Discontinue the corticosteroid if this occurs, and taper using hydrocortisone. **Hydrocortisone** is always the drug of choice in these sites. Use of “steroid sparers” such as emollients, occlusives and hydrators help to reduce total corticosteroid exposure, thereby reducing the risk of adverse effects.

It is possible to develop an allergic sensitivity to corticosteroid preparations themselves, which appears paradoxical due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the corticosteroids. However, delayed-type reaction to corticosteroids do occur.​[^[115]] Reported incidence rates in positive patch test results ranged from 0.5%– 3% for various topical corticosteroids in one study.​[^[116]] Nonresponding eczema, development of subacute contact dermatitis, systemically reactivated allergic contact dermatitis or maculopapular exanthems can be a clinical symptom of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to corticosteroids. The anti-inflammatory nature of corticosteroids makes the diagnosis of allergy more difficult, but it should be considered in patients suffering from intractable dermatitis. Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids remain uncommon.​[^[117]]​[^[118]]

##### Systemic Corticosteroids

Systemic agents are reserved for severe, acute cases, such as extensive poison ivy/oak; when treating poison ivy/oak, a prolonged course of oral therapy with a slow taper is often required.​[^[119]] In general, prolonged use of oral agents for other causes is to be avoided due to adverse effects including diabetes, hypertension, growth retardation, lymphopenia, bone loss, glaucoma/cataracts and development of Cushing syndrome.​[^[120]]

##### Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are analogues of cyclosporine and have anti-inflammatory effects. They are highly effective in improving dermatitis and pruritus. Tacrolimus was effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-resistant allergic contact dermatitis in one study​[^[121]] and as effective as a moderate-potency corticosteroid in another.​[^[122]] Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have both been shown to be effective for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children and adults.​[^[94]]​[^[123]] There is some evidence that tacrolimus may have a greater effect than pimecrolimus over time.​[^[123]]​[^[124]]​[^[125]]​[^[126]] Topical calcineurin inhibitors may not be as effective as moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroids in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.​[^[123]] Use of TCI therapy 2–3 times weekly between atopic dermatitis flares is recommended on flare-prone areas to help prevent relapses and decrease the amount of topical corticosteroid needed.​[^[94]]

The most common adverse effect reported for TCIs is burning and stinging at the application site, particularly if the skin is acutely inflamed. Treatment with topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation prior to instituting TCI therapy may help minimize these reactions.​[^[94]] Concerns about increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression may warrant avoiding use on actively infected skin. There is insufficient evidence to support concerns about any link between use of TCIs and risk of malignancy. Routine blood work is not recommended.​[^[78]]​[^[94]]

TCIs are usually considered second-line therapy when topical corticosteroid therapy is ineffective or not tolerated. The major advantage of TCIs is their safety profile and tolerability. They are recommended as steroid-sparing options for long-term topical treatment. They may be safely used in sensitive or thin-skinned areas such as the face, anogenital region and skin folds.​[^[94]]

##### Topical Anti-infectives

Atopic individuals are predisposed to skin infections because of a compromised physical barrier. S. aureus is found in more than 90% of atopic dermatitis. A systematic review examined 26 randomized controlled trials that used a variety of antistaphylococcal treatments in the management of atopic dermatitis, including oral antibiotics, antibacterial soaps, topical antibiotics or antiseptics, special textiles and combinations of topical corticosteroids with antibacterials. While reduction of S. aureus counts on the skin was reported with some interventions, no trials showed improvement in eczema control. The poor quality of many of the studies and low patient numbers make this evidence difficult to interpret.​[^[127]] Topical antimicrobial preparations are not generally recommended in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. They can be associated with contact dermatitis, and there is concern that their use could promote wider antimicrobial drug resistance. Oral antibiotics are not indicated for routine treatment in noninfected atopic dermatitis.​[^[94]]

Bleach baths are sometimes used in cases of moderate to severe disease with frequent bacterial infections; however, evidence is conflicting.​[^[128]]​[^[129]]​[^[130]]​[^[131]] Development of bacterial resistance is less of a concern with use of diluted bleach compared with the use of topical and systemic antibiotics.​[^[94]]

Treatment with antifungal agents is sometimes used to address dermatophyte pathogens such as *Malassezia* in atopic dermatitis, but the response to these is less effective than treatment with topical corticosteroids.​[^[29]]

##### Antihistamines

Pruritus is the hallmark of atopic dermatitis and a frequent symptom of contact dermatitis. The itch-scratch cycle complicates atopic dermatitis and should be aborted. Oral antihistamines act by blocking H1-receptors, thereby reducing pruritus caused by histamine. However, pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis is thought to be caused by mediators other than histamine, which is not the key factor.​[^[132]] Certain subgroups of patients may benefit from antihistamines for other reasons. The first subgroup are those with sleep disturbances. The benefit of antihistamines comes from their side effects. **First-generation antihistamines** cause drowsiness, which may help patients with atopic or contact dermatitis (adults and children) by promoting sleep or affecting sleep disturbances in the presence of pruritus. In these situations, first-generation antihistamines should be used before going to sleep.​[^[132]] For a second subgroup with comorbid conditions of the atopic diathesis, including allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, dermographism or allergen-induced asthma, second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine and desloratadine can be tried. See Allergic Rhinitis for more information regarding oral antihistamines.

Topical antihistamines are strong contact sensitizers. In addition, due to the ionization that occurs topically, they are not efficacious when applied to normal skin. They have demonstrated little utility, and for these reasons, and due to the increased efficacy of other agents, they should be avoided.

An approach to the treatment of atopic dermatitis is shown in #algorithms-119-04D039D3/fig-11921-04D0EE13. An approach to the treatment of contact dermatitis is shown in #algorithms-119-04D039D3/fig-11922-04D0F88B.

##### Further Therapy

For patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that is not controlled with topical therapy, oral cyclosporine therapy may be tried when phototherapy is not available or is contraindicated. Other agents include systemic immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate. The monoclonal antibody dupilumab is also an option for adult patients.More information about the treatment of atopic dermatitis can be found in Atopic Dermatitis.

##### Natural Health Products

Natural remedies may not be harmless and should not be recommended over traditional, standardized and proven therapies. At this time, there are little data to support the majority of complementary therapies tried for atopic dermatitis management. Chinese herbal therapy (or traditional Chinese medicine) has been the most extensively studied. Anti-eczematous efficacy of traditional Chinese herbal medicines was found in one study.​[^[133]] While it may have some benefit for lesions, the results from randomized controlled trials of oral therapy are conflicting, and reports of serious hepatotoxicity raise potential safety concerns. Some preparations have been reported to cause fatal toxic reactions, and adulteration with other substances such as corticosteroids has also been reported.​[^[134]]​[^[135]] The individualized and dynamic nature of this intervention (a different herb is added or subtracted depending on the patient) also poses challenges to performing controlled studies. Acupuncture alone or in conjunction with traditional Chinese medicine decreases signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, but the evidence is confined to small studies of limited quality.​[^[136]]​[^[137]]

The disturbed epidermal barrier function of atopic dermatitis has been linked to altered metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. This is the theoretical rationale for treatment with essential fatty acids such as gamma-linolenic acid (evening primrose oil). Use is characterized by a low incidence of side effects but also low efficacy in adults, with results in children no better than placebo. Two potential problems associated with use of evening primrose oil are its high cost and the lack of product standardization; adulterated brands may simply contain corn oil. Its use is clinically unsubstantiated and should not be recommended.​[^[12]] A Cochrane review found no improvement in symptoms of atopic eczema or quality of life with use of borage oil or evening primrose oil compared with placebo.​[^[138]]

Massage therapy may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis and associated patient and parental anxiety levels. While it is a safe intervention, studies to date are small and of limited quality, precluding recommendation at this time.​[^[139]]​[^[140]] Other complementary therapies lacking sufficient evidence include aromatherapy, homeopathy, naturopathy,​[^[141]] acupressure​[^[142]] and autologous blood injections.​[^[143]]

In the case of allergic contact dermatitis due to nickel sensitivity, some effects of nickel may be eliminated or reduced by supplementing with divalent essential metals, as there is some evidence that nickel dermatitis improved following oral administration of zinc sulfate.​[^[144]]​[^[145]]

#### Stasis Dermatitis

Pharmacologic treatment of stasis dermatitis includes regular use of non-sensitizing moisturizers to improve epidermal hydration. Topical corticosteroids are often effective to decrease inflammation and itch during acute flares. Higher potency topical corticosteroids are generally avoided due to the risk of cutaneous atrophy which may predispose the patient to ulceration.​[^[146]] There is some evidence for use of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of stasis dermatitis.​[^[147]]​[^[148]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 9 provides a monitoring framework for patients with dermatitis, which should be individualized. Parameters should be monitored by the patient or the caregiver, and a diary can be used. Therapy should be appropriately tapered in response to improvement or resolution. The health-care practitioner should be responsible for ensuring that the treatment plan remains on schedule and is effective, and no adverse effects are occurring. Changes in symptoms due to treatment can be correlated with alterations in trigger factors such as irritants. Stress, anxiety and depression levels should be tracked if they are suspected aggravating factors, and may lessen as skin symptoms improve.
