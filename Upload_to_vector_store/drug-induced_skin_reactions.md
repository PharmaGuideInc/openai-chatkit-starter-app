#### Pathophysiology

Approximately 6% of all hospital admissions are the result of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).​[^[1]] Skin eruptions are the most frequently observed, accounting for approximately 45% of all ADRs. In the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program, the prevalence of cutaneous ADRs in hospitalized patients was 2.2%.​[^[2]] Maculopapular eruptions and urticaria/angioedema are the most frequently reported drug rashes.​[^[3]]



Approximately 30–35 different cutaneous drug reaction patterns have been identified.​[^[7]] When evaluating a patient with a potential drug-induced eruption, it is important to note that in addition to those discussed in this chapter, there are many other less-common reactions including psoriasiform eruptions,​[^[8]] drug-induced cutaneous lupus erythematosus,​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]] symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE or “Baboon Syndrome”),​[^[12]] lichenoid drug eruption,​[^[13]]​[^[14]] and drug-induced vasculitis​[^[15]]​[^[16]] that are not addressed here.

#### Exanthematous Eruptions

#### Simple Eruptions

Exanthematous eruptions, also known as morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, are the most common cutaneous ADRs. These eruptions have been reported to account for approximately 95% of all drug-induced cutaneous eruptions.​[^[41]] They usually start as macules (pink/red in lightly pigmented skin; purple/brown/black in darkly pigmented skin) and papules on the trunk, become confluent and later spread symmetrically to the face and limbs; there is no evidence of blistering or pustulation. Resolution occurs with a change in colour from bright red to a brownish-red in lightly pigmented skin or from purplish to dark brown or black in darkly pigmented skin. This colour change may be followed by scaling or desquamation. Pruritus is a frequent clinical symptom but is not necessarily present. Simple eruptions usually begin within 7–10 days of starting therapy and resolve within 7–14 days after discontinuation of the drug.​[^[42]]

#### Complex Eruptions

DRESS, also known as drug hypersensitivity syndrome, is a complex drug reaction that includes fever, skin eruption (usually exanthematous and may be associated with facial swelling), eosinophilia and internal organ involvement such as hepatitis, nephritis or agranulocytosis, although the internal organ involvement may be asymptomatic.​[^[43]]​[^[44]] The syndrome usually begins with fever 2–6 weeks after initial drug exposure, and patients often initially complain of malaise.​[^[4]] In patients with a history of DRESS, re-exposure to the offending agent may lead to symptoms within 1 day.​[^[44]] DRESS is not related to dose or serum concentration of the drug. Although symptoms resolve in most patients after discontinuation of the drug, relapses or flares may occur; approximately 6–16% of patients may develop long-term sequelae, including (rarely) autoimmune disease and/or production of autoantibodies, after resolution of DRESS.​[^[22]]​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]] This can include development of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease or lupus erythematosus. Sequential reactivation of various human herpes viruses (HHVs) particularly HHV-6 and HHV-7 has been observed and is often associated with a prolonged case of DRESS.​[^[44]]​[^[48]]See Photo, Hypersensitivity Syndrome Reaction.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows the torso of an adult with a widespread rash. The rash appears as numerous small, red, and slightly raised spots covering the chest and upper abdomen. The skin between the spots is also red, giving an overall erythematous appearance. The distribution is diffuse, affecting the entire visible area of the torso. There are no visible signs of blistering or pustules. The rash may suggest a condition such as a viral exanthem, drug reaction, or another dermatological condition. For a precise diagnosis, a clinical evaluation would be necessary.

#### Urticarial Eruptions

#### Simple Eruptions

Urticaria, characterized by extremely pruritic, raised wheals of varying sizes and shapes, and angioedema (affecting deep dermal and subcutaneous tissues) are reversible types of edema affecting the skin. The wheals may appear pink or red in lightly pigmented skin but any colour change may be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin. In some patients, urticaria and/or angioedema may be associated with other symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, hypotension and/or wheezing/stridor, which are indicative of anaphylaxis.​[^[49]] In general, individual lesions of urticaria last for less than 24 hours, although new lesions continually develop. 

Many medications can cause urticaria, angioedema or both; other causal agents are food, physical factors (e.g., cold, pressure), infections and idiopathic factors.​[^[50]] Medications account for only 5–10% of urticaria cases. Adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors manifesting as angioedema may occur within hours of starting the drug but can occur weeks, months or even years into therapy. Unlike angioedema related to anaphylaxis, angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors is not IgE-mediated, but is instead thought to involve bradykinin and other proinflammatory mediators.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] NSAIDs and ASA can cause acute urticaria/angioedema through direct mast cell activation or by non–mast cell-mediated mechanisms such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition.​[^[53]]

#### Complex Eruptions

Serum sickness–like reactions are defined by fever, rash (usually urticarial) and arthralgias occurring 1–3 weeks after drug initiation. In contrast to true serum sickness, serum sickness–like reactions are not associated with immune complex formation, vasculitis or renal lesions.​[^[54]] See Photo, Serum Sickness-like Reaction.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a person's skin, likely on the torso, displaying multiple red, irregularly shaped patches or lesions. These patches vary in size and are scattered across the skin. The redness suggests inflammation or irritation. The surrounding skin appears to be of normal tone. There are no visible labels, text, or annotations in the image. The pattern and appearance of the lesions could be indicative of a dermatological condition, but specific diagnosis would require clinical correlation.

#### Blistering Eruptions

#### Simple Eruptions

Fixed drug eruptions usually appear as solitary, well-demarcated macules, papules, plaques or bullae that are often violet in lightly pigmented skin or purple, brown or black on darkly pigmented skin. The macules may evolve into an edematous plaque. In some patients, multiple lesions may be present. Blistering and erosion may occur on mucosal surfaces, especially the genitalia and lips, and some patients may complain of burning or stinging on the affected skin sites. Fixed drug eruptions recur in the same skin area after readministration of the causative medication.​[^[13]]​[^[55]]

#### Complex Eruptions

Serious dermatologic eruptions include SJS and TEN. The typical course of SJS or TEN consists of extreme illness, including fever and malaise, with generalized tender or painful inflammation of the skin followed by extensive epidermal necrosis and sloughing of skin or mucous membrane leading to marked loss of fluids and electrolytes.​[^[4]] Diagnosis of SJS versus TEN is based on the extent of epidermal detachment: for SJS <10% of body surface area, SJS/TEN overlap 10–30% and TEN >30%. These conditions predispose the patient to pneumonia and septicemia. Mortality rates for SJS and TEN have been reported to be 10–34%​[^[56]] (see Photo, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis).

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is another rare bullous eruption that has been linked to vancomycin administration, usually occurring within 3–15 days of drug introduction. Other drugs that have been implicated include phenytoin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.​[^[57]] Improvement is generally observed upon drug withdrawal, although some patients may have a prolonged course.​[^[13]]​[^[58]]

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepithelial disease characterized by pruritus followed by urticarial plaques and bullae of the skin and mucosa. Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid demonstrates similar clinical and histological features. Drugs implicated in triggering or inducing bullous pemphigoid include enalapril, furosemide, penicillamine and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors including linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin.​[^[13]]​[^[59]]​[^[60]]​[^[61]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of skin with extensive redness and peeling. The skin appears inflamed and there are large areas where the top layer has peeled away, revealing raw, red tissue underneath. The peeling is irregular, with some areas showing more severe detachment than others. This appearance is consistent with a severe skin reaction, possibly indicative of conditions such as a burn, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or a severe drug reaction. The surrounding skin also appears red and inflamed, suggesting widespread involvement. There are no visible labels or annotations in the image.

#### Pustular Eruptions

#### Simple Eruptions

Drug-induced acne may appear in atypical areas, such as arms and legs, and comedones are usually absent (see Photo, Acneiform Eruption). An acneiform eruption often occurs following treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, cetuximab). The acneiform rash is often accompanied by paronychia, dry skin and skin fissures. The eruption is dose-dependent with respect to both incidence and severity.​[^[62]]

![](images/druginducedskinreactions_acneru_ma.jpg)


**AI Image Description:**
The image shows the chest area of an individual with numerous skin lesions. These lesions appear as red, inflamed bumps, some of which may be pustular. The distribution is primarily across the upper chest and shoulders. The lesions vary in size and are scattered, with some clustering observed. The skin surrounding the lesions appears slightly erythematous. This presentation is consistent with a condition such as acne or folliculitis. There are no visible labels or annotations in the image.

#### Complex Eruptions

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is characterized by acute onset, fever and a cutaneous eruption with nonfollicular pustules. Generalized desquamation occurs 2 weeks after the initial reaction (see Photo, Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis.)

![](images/druginducedskinreactions_acugenexapus_ma.jpg)


**AI Image Description:**
The image shows the back of a person with a widespread skin condition. The skin appears to have a diffuse rash characterized by numerous red, scaly patches and plaques. These lesions are distributed across the entire back, with some areas appearing more densely covered than others. The rash has a somewhat symmetrical pattern and varies in intensity, with some areas showing more redness and scaling. The overall appearance suggests a condition that could be consistent with a dermatological issue such as psoriasis or a drug eruption, but a clinical diagnosis would require further medical evaluation.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a person's upper arm with a skin condition. The skin appears to have multiple small, raised, and possibly inflamed lesions or bumps. These lesions are distributed over the surface of the skin and may indicate a dermatological condition. The skin around the lesions appears slightly rough and possibly dry. There is a noticeable arrow pointing to one of the lesions, suggesting it may be of particular interest or importance in the context of the image. The overall appearance suggests a condition that might require medical evaluation for diagnosis and treatment.

#### Photosensitivity​[63]

Photosensitivity is an adverse cutaneous response to normally harmless doses of ultraviolet radiation. UVA rays are responsible for the majority of photosensitivity reactions. Drug-induced photosensitivity occurs commonly, representing up to 8% of reported cutaneous adverse events due to medication.​[^[64]] There are 2 types of photosensitivity reactions: phototoxicity and photoallergy.

Phototoxicity, the more common type of reaction, refers to an increased reactivity of the skin to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This can occur on the first exposure to a drug, is dose-related and is confined to exposed areas of the skin (e.g., face, neckline, back of the hands, arms, forearms, tops of feet). It generally resembles an exaggerated sunburn. These reactions do not contraindicate continued treatment with the drug or its reintroduction as long as effective protection against sunlight is ensured. Drugs associated with phototoxicity include amiodarone, fluoroquinolones, methotrexate, phenothiazines and tetracyclines (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage, Medications that May Cause Phototoxic Reactions).

Photoallergic reactions involve the immune system and therefore require prior sensitization to the drug. Photoallergy is delayed, usually occurring within 24–48 hours of exposure. Pruritus may occur prior to the onset of the cutaneous eruption. The lesions are often eczematous (e.g., with inflammation, vesicles and scaling) and may spread beyond exposed areas. Carbamazepine, chloroquine, NSAIDs, and sulfonamides have been reported to cause photoallergic reactions. Discontinuation of the photosensitizing medication is recommended; however, if the drug is considered essential, secondary prevention measures such as sun avoidance and use of sun-protective clothing and sunscreens is suggested.​[^[63]]

#### Contact Dermatitis

Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction of the skin that results from direct contact with a causative agent.​[^[65]] Most cases are either allergic contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy, nickel, neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, diphenhydramine) or irritant contact dermatitis (e.g., chemicals, hot peppers)​[^[66]] (see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis).

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Stepwise assessment of patients with possible drug-induced skin reactions is described in Figure 1.

Patients with a drug eruption require referral to an appropriate health-care practitioner. Although the rash may be self-limiting and require only self-care measures, patients may require alternative therapy (e.g., a patient develops a nonspecific maculopapular rash 7 days after starting lamotrigine for a seizure disorder, the lamotrigine is discontinued, and now an alternative drug is needed for the seizure disorder). Many drug eruptions are more complex in that they are also associated with systemic signs. A patient who develops any systemic symptom such as malaise, fever or shortness of breath requires immediate medical care since this may signal a more serious reaction.​[^[67]]

Since many skin diseases mimic drug reactions, it is important to carefully evaluate other causes of the cutaneous eruption. For example, guttate psoriasis may develop in a person being treated with penicillin for streptococcal infection, but the skin lesions are those of psoriasis and not a drug reaction. Differential diagnoses often include viral exanthems, especially in the acute phase (e.g., infectious mononucleosis, rubella, roseola or COVID-19 see Viral Skin Rashes), bacterial infections (see Bacterial Skin Infections), Kawasaki disease, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia.​[^[48]] Disease states can also act as cofactors in the development of a cutaneous eruption. For example, the presence of infectious mononucleosis raises the risk of ampicillin- or amoxicillin-induced exanthematous eruptions from 3–7% to 15–30% or higher.​[^[68]] As well, between 44% and 83% of HIV-infected individuals experience a dermatologic adverse reaction with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, whereas these events occur in less than 10% of the general population.​[^[69]]

Cutaneous reactions to drugs frequently occur in complicated clinical scenarios that may include exposure to multiple agents, in which case a timeline should be developed. It is important that a detailed history be obtained for evaluation of an adverse drug reaction. This includes dosage, restarting and stopping the medication, and time interval between drug administration and the onset of reaction. A history of prior exposure to the drug and related compounds is also important. If a patient has become sensitized to a drug that has been received previously, the rash may appear sooner on re-exposure to that drug. New drugs initiated within the preceding 3 months are more likely causative agents, as are drugs that have been used intermittently, including nonprescription medications and natural health products.​[^[70]] Although excipients do not cause ADRs in most individuals, there are isolated case reports of excipients causing skin reactions.​[^[71]]

The final step in the assessment of a patient with a cutaneous eruption is to determine the probability of each potential drug cause. A cutaneous eruption due to other causes (e.g., disease state, environmental/occupational agents) is commonly mislabelled as a drug reaction. This misdiagnosis may unnecessarily limit the future use of a particular medication or any related compound. Referral of the patient to a specialized centre that performs testing may be helpful in determining causality. Skin testing has been used for IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., urticaria/anaphylaxis), in particular for suspected beta-lactam antibiotic allergies,​[^[72]] as well as for some delayed reactions (e.g., maculopapular eruption); patch testing has been used for delayed cutaneous reactions (e.g., contact dermatitis).​[^[30]] Oral challenge is still considered the gold standard for many types of reactions.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]] In vitro testing (e.g., lymphocyte transformation test or LTT) is still primarily used for research purposes.​[^[75]] It is important to document the possible drug reaction in the patient’s medical and pharmacy records to ensure that future therapies are not pharmacologically and/or chemically related to the suspect drug.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Many drug-induced skin eruptions, such as urticaria, are often pruritic. Dry skin and overheating can exacerbate pruritus. Overbathing, hot water, harsh soaps, and bubble bath preparations dry and irritate the skin and should be avoided.​[^[76]] A simple physical measure is cooling the skin by tepid showering. Baking soda (1/2 cup) in a tepid bath may also help to relieve pruritus.​[^[77]] Tap water compresses can be used on blistering lesions; moisten gauze or other thin cloth in warm tap water and apply for 20 minutes 4–6 times daily. Alternatively, compresses can be applied intermittently, 1 minute on, 1 minute off, for 20 minutes. Oral lesions can be treated with warm water or saline rinses. Advise patients to avoid factors that may enhance pruritus, such as the wearing of tight elasticized apparel or coarse woollen fabrics.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

|  |
| --- |
| Discontinuation of the offending drug is considered paramount in the management of patients with cutaneous eruptions. However, in some cases, the drug may be continued and the reaction “treated through.”​[78] For example, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab, nivolumab) are often continued in conjunction with topical corticosteroids in patients who experience a mild or moderate (<30% body surface area) maculopapular eruption.​[79]​[80] This decision is influenced by the severity and probable course of the reaction, disease for which the drug was prescribed, ease or difficulty with which the reaction can be managed, and the availability of chemically unrelated drugs with similar pharmacologic properties.​[81] |


Table 4 addresses pharmacologic management of drug-induced skin reactions.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: External Analgesics; Cough, Cold and Allergy Products; Skin Care Products: Dermatitis and Dry Skin.

#### Symptomatic therapy

Both traditional **H1-antagonist antihistamines** and **nonsedating antihistamines** are effective in the treatment of pruritus associated with urticaria.​[^[82]] See Allergic Rhinitis for adult and pediatric doses of oral antihistamines. Patients whose symptoms do not improve within 5–7 days require further assessment and/or treatment. The use of **topical antihistamines**, such as those containing diphenhydramine, is not recommended due to risk of allergic contact dermatitis as well as increased systemic absorption when applied to open lesions. Patients with urticarial lesions should avoid NSAIDs or ASA since these agents may exacerbate urticaria; they are common causes of drug-induced urticaria.

Unscented **moisturizer** or white petrolatum should be applied to the skin while it is slightly damp to retard water evaporation. Topical agents may be kept in a refrigerator because the physical cooling enhances their antipruritic effect.

Topical astringents in a cream or lotion format, such as zinc oxide cream, can also be used. The use of **cooling salves** such as menthol 0.25–0.5% or camphor 0.25–0.5% cream may be helpful although they may occasionally be irritating.

Counsel patients with photosensitivity reactions to stay out of the sun until the reaction resolves or to wear sunscreen and protective clothing. Exposed areas should be covered with a sunscreen that protects in the UVA range with a minimum SPF of 15–30. See Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage for a further discussion of sunscreens. Mild to moderate phototoxic reactions can be managed as ordinary sunburn (e.g., oral analgesics, cooling compresses or baths, emollient lotions).​[^[63]]

Topical  corticosteroids are often used in the management of patients with drug-induced skin eruptions. Choice of potency and vehicle will depend on the body area affected and the extent and severity of the reaction. Use only low-potency agents on the face and intertriginous folds. Ointments are more occlusive and are preferred for dry or scaly lesions, whereas creams are used in moist areas since they are more drying. Lotions are useful for the scalp and other hairy areas or for application to large body areas. The topical corticosteroid should be applied sparingly with gentle massage onto the affected area once to twice daily. If the skin lesions persist or worsen after 5–7 days of topical corticosteroid therapy, the patient should seek further assessment and/or treatment. For more detailed information on the use of topical corticosteroids, see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis.

**Systemic** corticosteroids are often used at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) in patients with DRESS who have severe systemic symptoms (e.g., life-threatening internal organ involvement) in conjunction with their cutaneous eruption; a slow taper is necessary, often requiring weeks to months.​[^[83]] For patients with SJS/TEN, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine have been used.​[^[36]]​[^[84]] Other therapies include TNF-alpha inhibitors such as infliximab and etanercept.​[^[85]]

#### Supportive measures

Patients with severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS/TEN require intensive supportive care including management of airway, renal function, fluid and electrolyte balance, nutrition, and skin and ocular surfaces as well pain control and infection prevention.​[^[86]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Provide symptomatic therapy for patients with drug-induced skin lesions. After discontinuation of the offending medication, most drug-induced cutaneous eruptions will resolve in 5–7 days. In patients with serious drug-induced reactions, symptoms generally begin to abate within days, but this may vary from weeks to months. Many patients require further assessment; some patients may require a change in therapy, drug testing or follow-up (e.g., liver function tests). Any patient who has a fever or other accompanying symptoms such as malaise should be assessed by an appropriate health-care practitioner.

#### Advice for the Patient

Provide the patient with information regarding the adverse drug reaction. This includes the drug involved in the reaction (if known), the patient’s predisposition to possible recurrence on exposure to the drug, potential cross-reaction to other drugs (e.g., ASA and NSAIDs) and genetic predisposition of family members, if applicable. Advise the patient to enrol in the MedicAlert program.

| Drug | Reaction | Allele | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| abacavir | hypersensitivity syndrome | HLA-B*57:01 | Test all patients for this allele prior to initiation. Abacavir is contraindicated in those who are positive.​[88] |
| allopurinol | severe cutaneous reactions | HLA-B*58:01 | Test patients who are African-American or who are of Han-Chinese, Korean or Thai descent, as these populations have the highest frequency.​[89] Avoid use of allopurinol in those who are positive. |
| carbamazepine | DRESS, SJS/TEN, maculopapular rash | HLA-A*31:01 | Consider testing in patients descended from populations with highest frequency: European, Han Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South American. When an alternative treatment is available, avoid carbamazepine in patients who test positive and who have not received carbamazepine in the past. If no alternative treatment is available, increased frequency of clinical monitoring is recommended.​[90]​[91] |
| carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine | SJS/TEN | HLA-B*15:02 | Test all patients prior to initiating therapy. Avoid carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine in patients who test positive and who have not received these medications in the past. Phenytoin should also be avoided in these patients.​[90] |
| dapsone | DRESS, SJS/TEN | HLA-B*13:01 | Consider testing in patients descended from populations with highest frequency: Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian. Avoid dapsone in patients who test positive.​[92]​[93] |
| phenytoin | SJS/TEN | HLA-B*15:02 | Consider testing in patients descended from populations with highest frequency: Central/South Asian, East Asian. Avoid phenytoin in patients who test positive and who have not received phenytoin in the past. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine should also be avoided in these patients.​[94] |

   - **Question:** Does the rash cover a large part of the body or face? Are systemic symptoms present or any features of severe cutaneous drug reaction?
   - **Yes:** Patient requires immediate medical assessment.
   - **No:** Proceed to the next decision point.

3. **Decision Point 2:**
   - **Question:** Does the patient have underlying diseases or injuries that may be involved?
   - **Yes:** Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. Suggest self-care measures for symptoms of viral rash.
   - **No:** Proceed to the next decision point.

4. **Decision Point 3:**
   - **Question:** Has the patient been exposed to environmental/occupational agents that may be causative? (e.g., sunlight, artificial tanning devices)
   - **Yes:** Patient may require further assessment to determine causative agent. Suggest appropriate sun protection measures.
   - **No:** Proceed to the next decision point.

5. **Decision Point 4:**
   - **Question:** Has the patient started new medication(s) in the past 3 months? Is the patient on any medication?
   - **Yes:** Obtain history including dosage, date started, indication, duration, adherence, past use.
   - **No:** Consider symptomatic self-care measures. Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment if no improvement or worsening in 5–7 days.

6. **Decision Point 5:**
   - **Question:** Has the patient had a previous reaction to the same or similar medication?
   - **Yes:** Did reaction improve after a decrease in dosage or after discontinuation of the drug?
     - **Yes:** Likely that reaction is due to the medication. Change in treatment or testing may be necessary. Suggest appropriate self-care measures.
     - **No:** Unlikely that reaction is due to the medication. Suggest self-care measures. Change of therapy may be necessary.
   - **No:** Suggest self-care measures. Change of therapy may be necessary.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to evaluating a rash, considering various factors such as systemic involvement, underlying conditions, environmental exposures, and medication history.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **acetaminophen** (Tylenol, generics) | 325–1000 mg Q4–6H POSR: 650 mg Q8H PO; maximum 4 g/day | Hepatotoxicity: increased risk in malnourished patients, those with excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks per day) or pre-existing hepatic disease. Baseline LFTs should be measured in high-risk patients. | Acetaminophen has been reported to increase INR in warfarin-treated patients. Check INR if acetaminophen ≥2 g/day is used for ≥3 consecutive days. Adjust warfarin dosage as required.Phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine may increase acetaminophen metabolism and formation of toxic metabolite; thus, increased risk of hepatotoxicity; risk may be increased in patients taking high therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and antiepileptic drugs chronically. | Useful for treatment of mild to moderate phototoxic reactions that can be managed as for ordinary sunburn. |
| **ibuprofen** (Advil, Motrin, generics) | 200–400 mg Q6–8H PO; maximum dose for self-care: 1200 mg/day | Local GI effects (dyspepsia, diarrhea), GI complications (ulceration/upper GI bleed); exacerbation of HF, acute renal failure.Increased LFTs: transient; hepatotoxicity (rare); more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease or in patients with excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks/day). | Warfarin (increased bleeding risk via antiplatelet effects and GI complications); monitor INR more frequently during initial period after NSAID started and watch for signs of bleeding.Increased lithium levels—monitor.Methotrexate—NSAIDs inhibit the renal elimination of MTX. Avoid NSAIDs in people using high-dose MTX (e.g., cancer). For people using intermittent low-dose MTX for arthritis, risk is minimal. Antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, diuretics, ACEI): may decrease antihypertensive effects; measure baseline BP, remeasure 1–2 wk after starting NSAID and adjust antihypertensive therapy as required.Increased risk of GI bleed with SSRIs.Increased risk of GI adverse effects with alcohol.Give 30 min after or 8 h before low-dose ASA. | Useful for treatment of mild to moderate phototoxic reactions that can be managed as for ordinary sunburn. |
| **naproxen** (Aleve, Anaprox, Maxidol, generics) | 220–440 mg/day PO in 1 or 2 divided doses; maximum dose for self-care: 440 mg/day | Local GI effects (dyspepsia, diarrhea), GI complications (ulceration/upper GI bleed); exacerbation of HF, acute renal failure.Increased LFTs: transient; hepatotoxicity (rare); more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease or in patients with excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks/day). | Warfarin (increased bleeding risk via antiplatelet effects and GI complications); monitor INR more frequently during initial period after NSAID started and watch for signs of bleeding.Increased lithium levels—monitor.Methotrexate—NSAIDs inhibit the renal elimination of MTX. Avoid NSAIDs in people using high-dose MTX (e.g., cancer). For people using intermittent low-dose MTX for arthritis, risk is minimal. Antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, diuretics, ACEI): may decrease antihypertensive effects; measure baseline BP, remeasure 1–2 wk after starting NSAID and adjust antihypertensive therapy as required.Increased risk of GI bleed with SSRIs.Increased risk of GI adverse effects with alcohol.Give 30 min after or 8 h before low-dose ASA. | Useful for treatment of mild to moderate phototoxic reactions that can be managed as for ordinary sunburn. |
| **cetirizine** (Reactine, generics) | Adults and children >12 y: 5–10 mg/day; maximum 20 mg/dayChildren: 6–12 y: 5–10 mg/day 2–5 y: 2.5–5 mg/day12–23 months: 2.5 mg once daily; maximum 2.5 mg BID 6–11 months: 0.25 mg/kg Q12H | Minimal to no anticholinergic or CNS effects; however, may cause drowsiness in some individuals especially at higher doses.Headache. | Increased CNS depression: alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, barbiturates.Increased anticholinergic side effects: TCAs, scopolamine. | Patients whose symptoms do not improve within 5–7 days require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| **diphenhydramine** (Benadryl Preparations, generics) | Adults and children ≥12 y:25–50 mg Q4–6H PO; maximum 300 mg/dayChildren: 6–11 y: 12.5–25 mg Q4–6H; maximum 150 mg/day 2–5 y: 6.25 mg Q4–6H; maximum 37.5 mg/day | CNS: sedation, fatigue, dizziness, impairment of cognition and performance (the patient may be unaware of impairment).Anticholinergic: dryness of the mouth and eyes, constipation, inhibition of micturition, potential precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma, thickening of bronchial secretions. | Increased CNS depression: alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, barbiturates.Increased anticholinergic side effects: TCAs, scopolamine.May increase levels of CYP2D6 substrates, e.g., metoprolol, venlafaxine. | Use with caution in older patients as they may be more susceptible to side effects such as sedation and syncope.Avoid in patients with angle-closure glaucoma (increased IOP), urinary obstruction (prostatic hypertrophy), bladder neck obstruction (can cause urinary retention), GI obstruction.Observe infants and young children for paradoxical excitation.Patients whose symptoms do not improve within 5–7 days require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| **loratadine** (Claritin, generics) | Adults and children ≥10 y (>30 kg): 10 mg once dailyChildren 2–9 y (≤30 kg): 5 mg once daily | Minimal to no anticholinergic or CNS effects. Headache. | QTc prolongation reported with concomitant use of loratadine and amiodarone. Caution is advised.Pgp inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole) may increase loratadine levels while Pgp inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, dexamethasone) may decrease loratadine levels; clinical effect probably minimal. | Patients whose symptoms do not improve within 5–7 days require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| **zinc oxide** (Zincofax, generics) | Apply generously PRN | Well tolerated. | No clinically significant drug interactions. | Store in refrigerator, as physical cooling enhances antipruritic effect. |
| **menthol- or camphor-containing salves** (Rub A-535, others) | 0.25–5% in various bases; apply PRN | May occasionally be irritating. | No clinically significant drug interactions. | Provide a cooling sensation on the skin.Store in refrigerator, as physical cooling enhances their effect. |
| **prednisone** (generics) | 1–2 mg/kg/day PO × 7–10 days May need to continue for longer time periods if symptoms reoccur | Acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain, mood swings and agitation, cataracts, myopathy, hypertension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of large joints, adrenal suppression, increased susceptibility to infection | Clearance may decrease with estrogens; may increase digitalis toxicity secondary to hypokalemia.Phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase metabolism, which may necessitate increased maintenance dose. Increased risk of hypokalemia with coadministration of diuretics. | Used only for select patients with systemic symptoms in association with a cutaneous eruption (e.g., DRESS). |
| **desonide** (generics) | Apply sparingly with gentle massage daily–BID PRNMore potent products may be used in areas other than face or folds if required | Striae, telangiectasia, atrophy, purpura. | No clinically significant drug interactions. | Cream: useful in moist areas (due to possible drying effect).Ointment: preferred for dry or scaly lesions.Lotion: useful for scalp and other hairy areas or for application to large body areas.Patients whose symptoms do not improve within 5–7 days require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| **hydrocortisone** (generics) | Apply sparingly with gentle massage daily–BID PRN | Striae, telangiectasia, atrophy, purpura. | No clinically significant drug interactions. | Cream: useful in moist areas (due to possible drying effect). |
| **emollients** | Apply generously PRN | Possible temporary stinging on application. | No clinically significant drug interactions. | After bathing, apply unscented moisture cream or white petrolatum to the skin while it is still slightly damp to avoid water evaporation.Useful for treatment of mild to moderate phototoxic reactions that can be managed as for ordinary sunburn. |
