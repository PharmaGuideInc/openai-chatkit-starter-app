#### Introduction

Pharyngitis is defined as the inflammation of the pharynx, tonsils or nasopharynx; it can have infectious and noninfectious causes. Acute pharyngitis is defined as the presence of pharyngitis symptoms for a duration of less than 2 weeks.​[^[1]]

The infectious etiology of acute pharyngitis can be diverse. In all age groups, pharyngitis is commonly due to a viral etiology, regardless of group A streptococcus (GAS) colonization. For a list of possible infectious causes of pharyngitis, see the Infectious Diseases Society of America group A streptococcal pharyngitis guidelines.​[^[2]]

GAS is estimated to cause 5–15% of acute pharyngitis cases in adults and 20–30% in children (especially in the 5–15 year age group); it is most prevalent in winter through spring (November–May) and is the most common and important cause of *bacterial* pharyngitis.​[^[2]] Asymptomatic GAS carriage also varies with season and age; in the winter and spring months, over 20% of school-aged children may be colonized at peak times.​[^[1]] Rates of oropharyngeal carriage by age are as follows:​[^[1]]



Although generally now recognized as a self-limited infection, its medical importance (historically) is noted by acute rheumatic fever (ARF), its most significant postinfectious nonsuppurative complication. In Canada, contemporary rates of ARF have fallen significantly and are estimated at approximately 3 cases per million per year for ages 0–19.​[^[3]] However, according to one report, rates may be up to 70 times higher in the Indigenous population, postulated to be due to systemic health inequities, such as inadequate access to health care, overcrowded housing.​​[^[4]]

Patients at low risk of developing ARF after GAS pharyngitis include those who have:​[^[5]]



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Assessment with clinical and (where applicable) laboratory testing helps to improve diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic prescribing quality (see Figure 1).​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Generally, a clinical diagnosis alone should *not* be the trigger for antibiotic prescribing.

#### Clinical Features

| Temperature >38°CAbsence of coughSwollen, tender anterior cervical nodesTonsillar swelling or exudate | 1111 |
| Age | 3–14 y15–44 y≥45 y | 10-1 |

#### Laboratory Testing

Given the rates of oropharyngeal carriage, positive results from any testing modality are indicative only of GAS colonization and therefore must be correlated with the clinical assessment (i.e., modified Centor score), the individual’s risk for ARF and the results of respiratory viral studies (if available).

#### Prevention



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Analgesics

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be given for fever and throat pain in adults and children with generally equivalent results.​[^[1]] Medicated lozenges, sprays and gargles may provide modest aid in the symptomatic treatment of sore throat but are not superior to other symptomatic relief remedies for the cost.​[^[12]]​[^[13]]

#### Corticosteroids

When used with over-the-counter analgesics (with or without antibiotics), adjunctive therapy with a single dose of dexamethasone appears to provide additional symptomatic relief in non-hospitalized adults and children.​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Compared with placebo, at 24 hours post-steroid administration, an additional 12% of patients experienced complete resolution of pain, with an average of 11 hours to effect.​[^[15]] However, guidelines do not routinely recommend steroid use given the small magnitude of the benefit (an average drop of 1.3 points on a 10-point visual pain scale at 24 hours), the confounding effects of antibiotics on pain relief and the concerns over causing relapse. In patients with severe pain, case-by-case consideration of corticosteroids is reasonable after a patient-centred discussion around the merits of this intervention.​[^[1]]​[^[12]]

#### Antibiotics

Table 3 presents information regarding dosing and duration of antibacterials in the treatment of GAS pharyngitis.

Benefits of antibiotics are generally seen only for pharyngitis caused by GAS. Antibiotics are not generally recommended for other causes of pharyngitis; however, some unusual bacterial causes (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae) do require therapy.​[^[17]] 

With the proper clinical presentation, a positive RADT and/or throat culture is an indication to consider treatment with antibiotics. Conversely, a negative throat culture routinely allows the withholding of antibiotics in the vast majority of patients (see Figure 1).



#### Should Antibiotics Be Used to Achieve the Goals of Therapy?

In cases that meet both clinical and laboratory criteria, determining the risk for ARF is the critical first step when deciding whether antibiotics should be prescribed.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Management during Pregnancy

The diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis are generally not altered in the pregnancy setting. Penicillin V, amoxicillin and cephalosporins are considered safe in pregnancy.​[^[22]] For penicillin-allergic patients, azithromycin and clindamycin can be used.​[^[22]]

#### Management during Breastfeeding

Penicillin V, amoxicillin, cephalosporins and macrolides are considered safe for use in breastfeeding patients.​[^[23]] Clindamycin is also a viable option; however, monitor the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, e.g., diarrhea, candidiasis, etc.​[^[23]]​[^[24]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing acute sore throat, focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis and assessing the risk for acute rheumatic fever (ARF).

1. **Start**: Acute sore throat.
   
2. **Clinical Assessment**: Conduct a clinical assessment.

3. **Decision Point**: Determine if there is a reasonable pre-test probability for GAS pharyngitis to proceed to testing.
   - **No**: Routine GAS investigation is not required. Repeat clinical assessment in patients at high risk for ARF, especially with symptom progression.
   - **Yes**: Proceed to a rapid antigen test.

4. **Rapid Antigen Test Outcomes**:
   - **Positive**: Treat with antibiotics for GAS pharyngitis if:
     - High risk for ARF
     - Severe initial symptoms
     - Symptoms worsen or complications arise
   - **Negative**: Check for risk factor(s) for ARF.
     - **Yes**: Perform a throat culture.
     - **No**: No routine antibiotics required for GAS pharyngitis. Retest via throat culture if high risk for ARF.
   - **Not Readily Available**: Perform a throat culture.

5. **Throat Culture Outcomes**:
   - **Negative**: No further action specified.
   - **Positive**: Treat as indicated for GAS pharyngitis.

This flowchart guides clinicians through the decision-making process for testing and treating sore throat, emphasizing the importance of assessing the risk for ARF and the appropriate use of antibiotics.
