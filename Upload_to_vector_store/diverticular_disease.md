#### Introduction

Diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of saclike protrusions of the colon wall called diverticula. Diverticula develop when colonic mucosa and submucosa herniate through defects in the muscular layer of the colon wall. Up to 50% of people >60 years of age have diverticula; the majority remain asymptomatic and 10–25% develop complications such as diverticulitis.​[^[1]]

Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis, which can be classified as diverticulitis or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). Diverticulitis may be characterized as acute diverticulitis or chronic diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis can be complicated or uncomplicated, and chronic diverticulitis can be further divided into chronic recurrent diverticulitis or segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD). The categories of diverticulosis are represented in Figure 1.

This chapter outlines the assessment and management of diverticular disease within the ambulatory care environment.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart detailing the classification of diverticulosis and its related conditions. Here's a breakdown of the flowchart:

1. **Diverticulosis** is divided into two main categories:
   - **Asymptomatic diverticulosis**
   - **Symptomatic diverticulosis**

2. **Symptomatic diverticulosis** leads to two possible conditions:
   - **Diverticulitis**
   - **Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)**

3. **Diverticulitis** is further divided into:
   - **Acute diverticulitis**
     - **Acute complicated diverticulitis**
     - **Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis**
   - **Chronic diverticulitis**
     - **Chronic recurrent diverticulitis**
     - **Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD)**

The flowchart visually organizes the progression and classification of diverticulosis and its complications, providing a clear pathway from asymptomatic or symptomatic conditions to more specific diagnoses.

#### Goals of Therapy







#### Investigations

Initial evaluation of suspected diverticular disease may occur in the ambulatory care setting, although concerning signs on physical examination, laboratory data or imaging may warrant inpatient admission.









#### Therapeutic Choices

Therapy is determined by the type of diverticular disease suspected based on history (including severity and chronicity of symptoms), physical exam, laboratory data and imaging. 

Table 1 summarizes the therapeutic choices for the various presentations of diverticular disease, Figure 2 illustrates the management of diverticular disease and Table 2 details the properties of the medications used to manage diverticular disease.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

##### Fibre



##### Dietary Patterns

Looking beyond individual nutritional components to overall dietary patterns, the 47 000 participant EPIC-Oxford trial found those consuming a vegetarian diet had a decreased risk of diverticular disease compared with those consuming meat, after adjustment for fibre intake.​[^[7]] A 2017 prospective cohort study of >46 000 patients found that a Western diet (high in red meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy) was associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis and a prudent diet (high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains) was associated with decreased risk. The dietary pattern of the previous 1–4 years appeared more strongly associated with risk of diverticulitis than the long-term diet, indicating a potential for short-term dietary interventions to modify the risk.​[^[13]] The AGA recommends a prudent diet (high in fibre from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes and low in red meat and sweets) and a vegetarian diet to reduce the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[^[5]] and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) recommends reduced meat intake to decrease the risk of diverticulitis​[^[14]] 

##### Corn, Nuts and Seeds

Patients with diverticular disease should not be advised to avoid popcorn, nuts and seeds. Patients were historically advised to remove popcorn, nuts and seeds (including foods containing small seeds such as berries) from their diets, as it was theorized that these foods could become lodged within the diverticula and cause inflammation or bleeding; however, there was little evidence to support the recommendation. In 2008, a prospective observational study of >47 000 patients concluded that consuming popcorn and nuts did not increase the risk of complications of diverticular disease and that there was no association between combined strawberry and blueberry consumption and diverticular complications.​[^[15]] The AGA and NICE guidelines conclude the evidence to support restricting popcorn, nuts and seeds in the diet is lacking and recommend against advising patients to avoid these foods.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

##### Exercise

Regular, vigorous exercise should be recommended to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic diverticular disease. A low level of vigorous physical activity is independently associated with increased risk of diverticulitis.​[^[16]] A large prospective cohort study of 47 000 males 40–75 years of age with no known colonic disease at baseline found that patients with the highest quintile of total physical activity had a lower risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding over 18 years of follow-up.​[^[17]] This association was seen only with vigorous activity, which included running. The AGA recommends routine physical activity to decrease the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[^[5]] and the NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend educating patients about the benefits of exercise to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[^[6]]​[^[14]]

##### Body Mass Index

Patients with diverticular disease should be strongly advised to achieve and maintain a BMI within the healthy range (18.5–24.9). A high BMI is independently associated with increased risk of diverticulitis,​[^[16]]​[^[18]] and even moderate increases in BMI may increase the risk of diverticular disease as well as complications of diverticular disease.​[^[19]] The AGA recommends patients achieve or maintain a healthy BMI to reduce the risk of diverticulitis recurrence​[^[5]] and the NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend weight loss for overweight or obese patients to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[^[6]]​[^[14]]

##### Smoking Cessation

Providers should encourage smoking cessation in all patients with diverticular disease. Tobacco smoking is associated with an increased incidence of diverticular disease and related complications; current smokers are at higher risk for perforated diverticulitis and a diverticular abscess compared with nonsmokers.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] In addition, there was a dose-dependent positive association of diverticular disease with an increased number of cigarettes smoked per day. In an English study of over 65 000 patients managed nonoperatively for their first episode of diverticulitis, smoking and obesity were risk factors for readmission and emergency surgery.​[^[22]] The AGA, NICE and ASCRS guidelines recommend smoking cessation to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[14]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

##### 5-aminosalicylic Acid

**5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)** derivatives (mesalamine/mesalazine) are generally used as first-line therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as they are potent anti-inflammatory agents. After oral or rectal administration, mesalamine is absorbed by colonic epithelial cells and its impact is related to its local (luminal) or topical effect. The rationale behind the use of 5-ASA derivatives in diverticular disease is that the development of inflammation in existing diverticula results in acute diverticulitis and that the pathogenesis of SUDD may be related to chronic low-grade inflammation.





##### Rifaximin

Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed oral antibiotic that has been studied in the treatment of diverticular disease based on the premise that it might alter gut microbiota, but its role is not well defined. Several older studies describe efficacy of rifaximin in reducing symptoms in patients with uncomplicated disease.​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] Use of rifaximin in SUDD was studied in a meta-analysis, which found that 64% of patients treated with rifaximin plus fibre were symptom-free at 1-year follow-up compared with 35% of patients treated with fibre alone.​[^[34]] The AGA and ASCRS guidelines do not provide any guidance on the use of rifaximin in SUDD and suggest against its use for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis, pending further study.​[^[5]]​[^[14]]

##### Probiotics

Probiotics are formulated from gut microorganisms and have potential efficacy in several gastrointestinal illnesses, including IBD, *C. difficile* colitis, infectious diarrhea and IBS. The mechanisms of this effect are poorly understood but may be related to suppression of growth of pathogenic bacteria, improvement of intestinal barrier function, induction of protective cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), or modulation of pain perception.​[^[35]]

A 2016 systematic review evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in remission of abdominal symptoms and prevention of acute diverticulitis in patients with existing diverticular disease. Eleven studies were included in the review; 3 studies included patients with SUDD, 4 studies included patients with SUDD in remission, and 4 studies contained patients with complicated or acute diverticulitis. Although the authors concluded that the existing studies were not robust enough to draw meaningful conclusions, they noted that the use of probiotics trended toward a positive clinical response on abdominal symptoms or prevention of recurrence in patients with SUDD.​[^[36]] However, given that many of the symptoms of SUDD resemble or overlap those of IBS, and a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotics are an effective treatment for IBS, it is difficult to evaluate the true effect of probiotics on abdominal symptoms in patients with diverticular disease.​[^[37]] The AGA and ASCRS guidelines recommend against the routine use of probiotics for prevention of diverticulitis recurrence due to low quality of evidence; NICE concludes there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[14]]

##### Antibiotics



The AGA, ASCRS and NICE guidelines all suggest selective, rather than routine, use of antibiotics in patients with acute diverticulitis. Antibiotic therapy is appropriate for patients who are systemically unwell (fever, severe left lower quadrant pain, peritonitis on exam, elevated white blood cell count), immunosuppressed or have significant comorbidity.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[14]]



Outpatient treatment generally consists of oral antibiotics for 7–10 days. Patients are reassessed clinically 2–3 days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy and weekly thereafter until the complete resolution of all symptoms.

##### Ambulatory Care versus Inpatient Management

SUDD, chronic diverticulitis and acute uncomplicated disease can generally be managed in the ambulatory care setting; a study of patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis showed that after receiving a first dose of IV antibiotics in the emergency department, subsequent outpatient and inpatient treatment resulted in similar failure rates and quality of life.​[^[45]] However, acute uncomplicated disease with evidence of sepsis, microperforation, immunosuppression, high fever, significant leukocytosis, peritonitis, advanced age, significant comorbidities or failed outpatient treatment merits inpatient admission. When CT scan shows evidence of acute complicated diverticulitis (defined by the presence of perforation, abscess, obstruction or fistulization), inpatient treatment is warranted.
