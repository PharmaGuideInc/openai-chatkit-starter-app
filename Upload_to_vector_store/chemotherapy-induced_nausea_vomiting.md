#### Introduction

Managing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving anti-cancer treatments is a challenge. Although data on relative emetogenicity are available for many IV chemotherapeutic agents, there is less data available on oral chemotherapy regimens, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy.

Commonly called chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the condition is classified into 5 types: acute, delayed, anticipatory, refractory and breakthrough. Whether acute or delayed nausea and vomiting is experienced depends most strongly on the actual chemotherapy agents administered and their dosage and infusion rate.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]

Acute CINV:



Delayed CINV:



Anticipatory CINV:



Refractory CINV:



Breakthrough CINV:



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



Although medication is the most likely cause of nausea and vomiting in a patient receiving cancer treatment, rule out other potential causes (e.g., fluid/electrolyte abnormalities, partial or complete bowel obstruction, brain or hepatic metastases, infections, radiation therapy). Other drugs (e.g., opioids, digoxin, antibiotics) may cause or exacerbate nausea and vomiting; therefore, a thorough medication history is essential. Some anti-cancer agents are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting than others (see Table 1 and Table 2). It is important to consider the emetogenic potential, the dose of the chemotherapy agents and the expected pattern of emesis of the chemotherapy regimen when choosing antiemetics.​[^[1]]​[^[5]]​[^[11]] For combination chemotherapy regimens, manage the patient based on the drug with the highest emetogenic potential.

Patient-specific factors such as <50 years of age, female sex, and a history of motion sickness, nausea in pregnancy or CINV may raise the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting;​[^[12]] therefore, antiemetic regimens must be tailored to the individual patient.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Nausea and vomiting are mediated through a number of receptors; however, the type 3 serotonin (5-HT3) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors appear to be most important in CINV. Antiemetic agents targeting other neurotransmitters are important additional agents to help provide optimal prevention and treatment, but are not used as single agents for moderate or highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. Combining antiemetic drugs with different receptor targets can be an effective strategy in managing nausea and vomiting.



Figure 1 outlines the prevention of CINV and management of breakthrough nausea and vomiting for regimens with minimal, low, moderate and high emetogenic potential. Individual medications are detailed in Table 3.

#### Serotonin Antagonists

The first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) granisetron and ondansetron have equivalent efficacy and toxicity when used for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Single-agent efficacy is reported with ondansetron, but when it is used in combination with olanzapine, dexamethasone and an NK-1 receptor antagonist, efficacy for highly emetogenic regimens is improved. Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-HT3RA. When administered IV, it is effective in preventing both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The oral dosage form is effective in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with MEC; it is available only as a fixed-dose combination with netupitant.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Single-dose IV palonosetron prior to start of chemotherapy may be a more convenient option over the first-generation agents if multiple-day 5-HT3RA dosing is anticipated. These drugs are generally well tolerated with constipation and headache the most common adverse reactions.

#### Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists

The NK-1 receptor antagonists aprepitant, fosaprepitant and netupitant bind to substance P, found in the brainstem and GI tract. Fosaprepitant is used intravenously; aprepitant and netupitant are oral agents, with netupitant available only as a fixed-dose combination with palonosetron.​[^[24]] When added to a regimen of olanzapine, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3RA for HEC, NK-1 receptor antagonists improve prevention of acute and delayed emesis.​[^[25]]​[^[26]] Aprepitant and netupitant inhibit CYP3A4 and interact with corticosteroids, requiring a decrease in the antiemetic dose of dexamethasone when used concomitantly. These agents appear to be well-tolerated. Asthenia/fatigue and hiccups are the most commonly reported side effects with aprepitant, and constipation, fatigue and headache are the most common with netupitant.

#### Corticosteroids

Dexamethasone is the corticosteroid most commonly used in the management of CINV, although several others including methylprednisolone have been studied.​[^[27]] The actual mechanism of action is unknown, but corticosteroids appear to be effective as single agents or in combination with other antiemetics and are particularly effective in the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] The combination of dexamethasone with olanzapine, a 5-HT3RA and an NK-1 receptor antagonist is the most effective antiemetic regimen for acute nausea and vomiting.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] For patients receiving HEC or MEC who have few risk factors for CINV, or for patients who are intolerant of corticosteroids, dexamethasone can be given on Day 1 only or replaced with olanzapine.

#### Dopamine Antagonists

Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide are the dopamine antagonists most commonly used in the management of nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy regimens with low emetogenicity or as rescue agents.​[^[10]] Both agents block the dopaminergic receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Prochlorperazine may also exhibit serotonin antagonistic activity at higher doses. The availability of a wide variety of dosage forms (tablet, suppository, injectable) facilitates prochlorperazine use, especially for outpatients. Low doses of metoclopramide (10–20 mg) are generally as effective as prochlorperazine; however, in high doses (1–3 mg/kg), metoclopramide provides significantly higher antiemetic activity.​[^[31]] A limitation to dopamine antagonist use is the development of extrapyramidal side effects.

Although insufficient evidence from randomized, controlled trials exists,​[^[32]] haloperidol may be useful in the management of refractory nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy,​[^[10]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]] but may be less effective than metoclopramide.​[^[35]]

Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic agent that antagonizes several neurotransmitter receptors involved in the emetic pathway, including dopamine, 5-HT, histamine and acetylcholine-muscarine. Regimens containing olanzapine have demonstrated efficacy in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from HEC and MEC, and olanzapine monotherapy has proven effective in the treatment of breakthrough nausea and vomiting.​[^[36]] Expert groups support the use of olanzapine as part of 2-drug to 4-drug regimens for the prevention of CINV and as monotherapy for the treatment of breakthrough nausea and vomiting.​[^[8]]​[^[10]]

#### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines provide useful antianxiety, amnesic and sedating effects. Lorazepam and alprazolam are the most commonly used, and have been studied in cases of anticipatory nausea.​[^[37]]​[^[38]] They are usually used in combination with antiemetics.​[^[8]]​[^[10]]

#### Cannabinoids

The synthetic cannabinoid nabilone is of limited use because it is available only as an oral formulation and is associated with several side effects including dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, mood alterations, hallucinations, delusions, tachycardia and hypotension.​[^[1]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]] Higher doses are associated with increased risk of side effects. It is generally used in refractory nausea and vomiting or in combination with other antiemetics.​[^[1]]

The College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) indicates that cannabis (the dried plant or oil extracts) may be used in patients with treatment-refractory CINV who have failed to respond to standard therapies and a trial of nabilone.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Medical cannabis is not recommended in standard antiemesis guidelines.​[^[10]]​[^[43]]

#### Antihistamines and Anticholinergics

The antihistamine dimenhydrinate and the antimuscarinic scopolamine are useful for treating vomiting due to motion sickness but they are considered no more effective than placebo against CINV.​[^[44]]​[^[45]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart detailing the management of nausea and vomiting (N/V) based on the risk of emesis associated with chemotherapy. It outlines different treatment protocols for acute and delayed phases based on the emetic risk level: high, moderate, low, and minimal.

### Risk of Emesis Categories:

1. **High (>90%)**
   - **Acute Phase:**
     - NK1 RA + 5-HT3 RA + olanzapine + dexamethasone on day 1
   - **Delayed Phase:**
     - Olanzapine + dexamethasone on days 2–4 (+ aprepitant on days 2–3 if used in the acute phase)

2. **Moderate (31–90%)**
   - **Acute Phase:**
     - 5-HT3 RA + dexamethasone on day 1
   - **Delayed Phase:**
     - Dexamethasone on days 2–4

3. **Low (10–30%)**
   - **Acute Phase:**
     - 5-HT3 RA, dexamethasone, metoclopramide, or prochlorperazine on day 1
   - **Delayed Phase:**
     - No prophylaxis necessary

4. **Minimal (<10%)**
   - **Acute and Delayed Phases:**
     - No prophylaxis necessary

### Treatment of Breakthrough N/V:

- **Controlled:**
  - Continue original antiemetics if N/V starts after antiemetic course is completed.

- **Not Controlled:**
  - If not used already, add regular doses of one or more agents with different mechanisms of action:
    - Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, haloperidol, or olanzapine
    - Lorazepam or alprazolam (when anxiety is a component of CINV)
  - If still not controlled, add a cannabinoid such as nabilone.
  - If still not controlled, consider changing the chemotherapy regimen.

### Additional Recommendations:

- For the next cycle, administer antiemetics from the next higher emetogenic category and consider lorazepam for anticipatory N/V.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) based on the emetic risk and response to initial treatments.
