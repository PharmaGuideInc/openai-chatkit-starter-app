CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful in addressing patient needs, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is abdominal and pelvic pain associated with menses. More than half of menstruating Canadians are affected to some degree and 15% are incapacitated for 1–3 days per month.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Peak onset of primary dysmenorrhea occurs between late teens and early 20s with prevalence decreasing progressively with age. Risk factors include menarche <12 years of age, increased duration and amount of menstrual flow, smoking or passive smoke exposure, low BMI, family history of dysmenorrhea, and nulliparity.​[^[4]] Other risk factors include mood disorders, prior sexual abuse and poor social support.​[^[3]] Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of organic pathology, while secondary dysmenorrhea results from an underlying cause such as endometriosis, adenomyosis or obstructed uterine outflow (see Table 1).

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



| Primary | Secondary |
| --- | --- |
| No identifiable pelvic pathologyOccurs in ovulatory cyclesMost severe in young, nulliparous patientsOnset within 2 y after menarche; tendency to improve with ageMore common in people who smokePain due to myometrial contractions induced by prostaglandin production in the secretory endometriumPain is relieved or ameliorated by empiric therapy with NSAIDs and/or ovulation suppression | Associated with pelvic pathology, e.g., endometriosis, adenomyosis, submucous uterine myoma, endometrial polyp, intrauterine device, pelvic inflammatory disease, vaginal septum, imperforate hymen, congenital Mullerian malformations, post-endometrial ablation syndrome Age of onset is variableDiagnostic clues include pain onset premenstrually, pain lasting throughout the menses, infertility, dyspareunia, abnormal uterine bleedingPartial symptomatic improvement may be noted with NSAIDs |


#### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of dysmenorrhea is shown in Figure 1. It is important to explain that primary dysmenorrhea is a common phenomenon. It is frequently distressing and may be debilitating. Therefore, it is important to validate the patient’s concerns and offer symptomatic treatment. Reassure the patient that pain does not indicate an organic process or abnormality in most cases. If an organic cause is suspected, further investigation and targeted therapy are indicated.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

NSAIDs commonly used for the management of dysmenorrhea are presented in Table 2.

Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by abnormal uterine contractions as a result of increased prostaglandin production by the endometrium in ovulatory cycles. NSAIDs, which are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, are the treatment of choice. All NSAIDs except ASA have been shown to be effective in about 80% of cases of dysmenorrhea.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] In practice, there appears to be minimal difference among NSAIDs.​[^[11]] With short-term use, side effects of all NSAIDs are generally minor. Ibuprofen and naproxen** sodium** are available without a prescription. The choice depends more on tolerability, duration of action, cost and availability.​[^[3]]​[^[11]] NSAIDs should be taken with food, starting immediately at the onset of symptoms or menses and continued on a *regular schedule* for 2–3 days. An initial loading dose may help obtain faster relief of symptoms.​[^[3]] NSAIDs may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, e.g., MI or stroke.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] However, it should be noted that cardiovascular events are likely to be extremely rare in young patients using NSAIDs on an intermittent basis.

Acetaminophen demonstrates minimal analgesic effect in dysmenorrhea and inferior pain relief compared with NSAIDs.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Consider acetaminophen only for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs. 

#### Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

For a listing and prescribing  information on hormonal contraceptives, see Contraception.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are available as oral, vaginal or transdermal formulations. CHCs inhibit ovulation, which limits endometrial growth and decreases menstrual blood flow, thereby suppressing prostaglandin production at menses. CHCs are ideal first-line choices for patients wishing contraception.​[^[15]] COCs can effectively treat primary dysmenorrhea with both the medium- and low-dose estrogen formulas, i.e., ≤35 mcg ethinyl estradiol.​[^[3]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] The **contraceptive patch** or **vaginal ring** are also useful for relieving dysmenorrhea as COC.​[^[19]] Continuous or extended-cycle regimens decrease the frequency of menstrual periods and the prevalence of pain and are generally preferable to cyclic regimens.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] These regimens also ameliorate dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis and adenomyosis.

For prescribing information on contraceptives, see Contraception.

#### Progestin-Only Contraceptives

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system **(LNG-IUS)** releases a low dose of progestin inside the uterine cavity. While ovulation is not suppressed in all patients, the endometrium becomes atrophic and inactive, and menstrual blood loss is significantly reduced.​[^[3]] These effects can benefit patients with dysmenorrhea. LNG-IUS is recommended for treatment of dysmenorrhea associated with heavy bleeding​[^[22]]​[^[23]] and there is good-quality evidence that patients with dysmenorrhea and adenomyosis​[^[22]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]] or endometriosis​[^[27]]​[^[28]] will respond to LNG-IUS. Although the evidence is limited, LNG-IUS may also be considered for symptomatic management of dysmenorrhea irrespective of cause or associated symptoms.​[^[22]]​[^[24]]​[^[29]]

**Depot** medroxyprogesterone **(DMPA)** intramuscular injections suppress ovulation, induce endometrial atrophy and produce amenorrhea. Consider DMPA as a treatment option in the management of primary dysmenorrhea in patients who cannot tolerate estrogen and in those over 35 years of age who smoke.​[^[26]] DMPA can also be useful in treating secondary dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis, adenomyosis or structural abnormalities of the uterus. However, the return to fertility may be delayed after it is stopped; for patients wishing to become pregnant soon after discontinuation, other methods may be more appropriate. Although bone mineral density may return to baseline on discontinuation of therapy, use DMPA with caution in adolescents 12–18 years of age, as they have not yet attained their peak bone mass. To promote overall bone health, encourage adequate calcium (total of 1200 mg elemental Ca​[^2+] daily from all sources, preferably through dietary intake) and vitamin D (1000 units supplement daily) in patients on DMPA therapy.​[^[30]]

The single rod etonogestrel (ENG) implant has become available in Canada in 2020. Like other progestin-only long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), the implant works by continuously (over a period of 3 years) releasing a low-dose of progestin (etonogestrel), therefore inhibiting ovulation. Since its use is associated with a decrease in bleeding days per month, it may be a suitable option in the management of dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis-associated pain. 

#### Natural Health Products

Numerous medicinal herbs and vitamins have been proposed for the management of dysmenorrhea, but high-quality studies are lacking.​[^[3]] Some supplements, including fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, zinc sulphate, ﬁsh oil, fish oil plus vitamin B1, and vitamin B1 alone, may potentially provide benefit based on low-quality evidence.​[^[31]] Ginger at a dose of 750–2000 mg daily for 3 to 4 days at the start of a menstrual cycle may be comparable to NSAID treatment for pain and holds promise but high-quality trials are recommended.​[^[32]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing menstrual pain, detailing the decision-making process based on clinical investigations and treatment options.

### Main Steps:

1. **Start with Menstrual Pain:**
   - Begin with investigations: history and physical examination.

2. **Assessment Outcomes:**
   - **Normal Findings:**
     - Suspect primary dysmenorrhea.
     - Implement nonpharmacologic measures:
       - Exercise
       - Topical heat therapy
       - Encourage smoking cessation
     - If symptoms are relieved, continue nonpharmacologic measures.
     - If not relieved, assess if contraception is required or desired:
       - If yes, try CHC (combined hormonal contraceptive) or progestin-only contraceptive for 3–6 months.
       - If symptoms are relieved, continue treatment.
       - If not, consider hormonal contraceptive plus NSAID.
   - **Abnormal Findings:**
     - Suspect secondary dysmenorrhea.
     - Consider further investigations:
       - Diagnostic laparoscopy
       - Pelvic ultrasound
       - MRI
     - If symptoms are relieved with nonpharmacologic measures, continue them.
     - If not, and contraception is not required, try NSAID for 3–6 months.
     - If symptoms are relieved, continue treatment.
     - If not, consider hormonal contraceptive plus NSAID.
   - **Pelvic Assessment Not Possible:**
     - Proceed with pelvic ultrasound.

### Decision Points:
- **Symptoms Relieved:** Determines continuation of current measures or need for further intervention.
- **Contraception Requirement:** Guides the choice between hormonal contraceptives and NSAIDs.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing menstrual pain, emphasizing both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments based on individual needs and clinical findings.
