#### Introduction

In patients with impaired renal function, dosage adjustment may reduce the risk of drug toxicity. The following is a method to empirically adjust dosage (dose and/or interval) in adults based on an estimate of renal function and the drug’s degree of renal excretion (see Figure 1, Table 1). This approach does not apply to patients with obesity or those receiving any form of renal replacement therapy (consult specialized references). Readers may be more familiar with the term *estimated glomerular filtration rate* (eGFR) than *creatinine clearance* (ClCr). Both ClCr and eGFR are mathematically derived estimates of renal function based on a patient’s serum creatinine and other factors. Dose adjustment and drug regulator recommendations are still generally based on ClCr.

#### Patient/Drug Considerations

The following questions should be answered prior to making empiric dosage adjustments. Table 2 provides drug-specific information.

**Is the patient’s renal function impaired?**

Use the following formula​[^[1]] to estimate the *weight-corrected creatinine clearance* (ClCr) and to guide empiric dosage adjustments:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Males: ClCr (mL/min/70 kg) | = | (140 – age) × 90 |
|  |  | serum creatinine (µmol/L) |
| Females: ClCr (mL/min/70 kg) = 0.85 × above equation |  |  |


 To estimate the ClCr for dosage adjustment, use of a weight-corrected formula is recommended rather than the patient’s actual ClCr. This weight-corrected estimate standardizes the result to that of a “normal” ClCr for a 70 kg male (108–120 mL/min) and is more suitable for drug-dosage adjustments. 

Note: The formula above is based on research that classified participants as male or female, and the available evidence around renal function and drug dose adjustment is based on this classification. CPhA recognizes that individual patients may identify differently than their sex assigned at birth. In some cases, it may be necessary to consult literature specific to care for transgender patients.​[^[2]]

**Is the patient elderly or malnourished?**

Elderly (>65 years) or malnourished patients may have relatively low muscle mass and therefore produce less creatinine. If the actual serum creatinine for such patients is used, the formula can often overestimate renal function. A general rule in such patients is not to use a serum creatinine <100 µmol/L in the above formula.

**Which equation?**

Most laboratories report a glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the serum creatinine calculated using either the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Both equations were developed for staging chronic kidney disease with improved predictive performance over the Cockcroft-Gault equation in estimating the GFR. The use of African ancestry as a multiplication factor is no longer necessary and may in fact lead to inaccurate assessments and potentially harmful consequences for these patients.​[^[3]] Some clinicians use these equations to estimate the GFR in order to adjust medication doses in patients with renal impairment. For most patients, the weight-corrected Cockcroft-Gault, the MDRD and the CKD-EPI equations will provide similar estimates of renal function for use in drug-dosage adjustment. 

Clinicians should likely choose the equation that is easiest to use or the one with which they are most familiar. Most importantly, clinicians need to determine rational starting doses using not only these equations, but also by basing their decision on the urgency of the need for a response to drug therapy. All these issues make the debate about which formula to use to estimate renal function somewhat irrelevant. However, regardless of the method used, there is a critical next step: *titrate the dose whenever possible and determine the correct dose by monitoring a patient’s response to the dose chosen*.

**What if the ClCr estimate is ≥60 mL/min/70 kg?**

In general, if ClCr estimates are ≥60 mL/min/70 kg, empiric dosage adjustments are not required because reductions in ClCr to ≥60 mL/min/70 kg are associated with relatively small changes in the half-life of a drug or its active metabolite. However, as ClCr falls below 60 mL/min/70 kg, empiric dosage adjustments should be based on the following questions.

**Is the drug effective/safe in patients with renal impairment?** 

Some drugs are ineffective or potentially toxic in patients with clinically important renal dysfunction (ClCr <30 mL/min/70 kg) and should be avoided (see Table 2, Comments column). 

**Is the drug nephrotoxic?** 

A number of drugs have the potential to worsen renal function and an alternative non-nephrotoxic agent should be used if possible (see Table 2, Comments column). 

**Is an immediate clinical effect required?**

When failure to elicit an immediate response (e.g., life-threatening conditions or severe pain) poses a clinically important risk of mortality or morbidity, drug dosing should be aimed at obtaining a therapeutic response within minutes or hours irrespective of renal function. In an attempt to achieve a rapid response, usual initial doses should be used, followed by empiric dosage adjustments once the patient has responded.

**If an immediate effect is not required, can the dose be titrated?** 

Many conditions do not require an immediate or maximal effect, and dose titration can often be used to determine the lowest effective dose. To identify the correct dose for any patient, but particularly in patients with renal impairment, start with a low dose (e.g., one-quarter or one-half of the typically recommended dose) and titrate up to a clinical effect.

**Is the drug >50% renally eliminated or does it have active or toxic metabolites?** 

Drugs that are primarily eliminated by the kidney (>50%) require empiric dosage adjustments based on an estimate of renal function (see Table 2). In addition, some drugs are metabolized to active or toxic metabolites that may be excreted by the kidney and may need dosage adjustments. Some drugs should be avoided in patients with compromised renal function if toxic metabolites can accumulate, e.g., meperidine.

#### Approach to Empiric Dosage Adjustments

When dose titration is not possible or desired, base empiric dosage adjustments on estimates of renal function. 

#### Interval versus Dose Adjustment

For drugs given intermittently, the dose or the dosing interval can be adjusted based on the desired goal. Often a combination of extending the interval and reducing the dose is effective and convenient. If the aim is to achieve steady-state maximum/peak and minimum/trough concentrations (e.g., aminoglycosides) similar to those seen in patients with normal renal function, extend the interval between doses. If a relatively constant steady-state concentration is desired (e.g., antihypertensives), reduce the dose.

#### Drugs Eliminated ≥75% by the Kidney

Table 1 provides guidelines for the dosage of these drugs (see Table 2) based on the usual dosing interval. For frequently administered drugs (e.g., Q4H–Q12H), extending the interval may decrease the cost of administration or improve adherence.

#### Drugs Eliminated 50 to <75% by the Kidney

These drugs have a clinically important proportion of nonrenal clearance; therefore, empiric dosage adjustments are generally not required until renal function estimates are <45 mL/min/70 kg (see Table 1, Table 2).

#### Drugs Eliminated <50% by the Kidney

For drugs eliminated <50% by the kidney (see Table 2), empiric dosage adjustments are generally not required, assuming the drug has no active or toxic metabolites. However, these drugs may require dosage adjustment in patients with clinically important liver dysfunction.

#### Drugs with Active or Toxic Metabolites

Empiric dosage adjustments for drugs with active or toxic metabolites that are dependent on renal elimination should be made as though the drug were 75–100% renally eliminated (see Table 2, Comments column).

#### Further Dosage Adjustments Based on Clinical Response

All of the above recommendations are for empiric dosage adjustments, and further dosage changes must always be made based on a patient-specific assessment of efficacy and toxicity. Serum drug concentration monitoring may guide dosage adjustments for certain drugs (see Table 2, Comments column).
