#### Introduction

Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] The terms "peripheral" or "central" are used to differentiate lesions that are located in the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively (see Table 1). This chapter focuses on peripheral neuropathic pain, but the same principles may be applied to central pain. "Neuralgia" is a historical term for neuropathic pain that suggests pain with a paroxysmal, brief, lancinating quality.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Neuropathic pain is often severe and debilitating. Although evidence may be lacking, many nonpharmacologic strategies (e.g., physiotherapy, mindfulness, yoga, exercise, psychotherapy) can be used to provide benefit in some patients and should be combined with pharmacotherapy. Attempt to reduce sleep deprivation and improve physical conditioning to rehabilitate patients and improve their quality of life. Patients may minimize chronic neuropathic pain by getting adequate rest and avoiding further aggravation. Continued medical visits provide important psychological support and hope for desperate patients who have failed standard therapy and facilitate a trial-and-error approach.

Some patients with nerve root compression who do not respond to conservative management may benefit from surgical options, see Nerve Root Compression: Cervical and Lumbar Radiculopathy. Surgical treatment usually has no role in postherpetic neuralgia and other types of neuropathic pain in the majority of patients, but may be helpful for patients with trigeminal neuralgia who do not respond to pharmacotherapy.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

In recent years, the therapeutic armamentarium for neuropathic pain has grown with the addition of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine), tramadol and cannabinoids. Although various drugs have demonstrated efficacy for treating neuropathic pain, further studies are required to assess improvements in quality of life.​[^[4]] The acute pain of herpes zoster and the unique condition of trigeminal neuralgia are considered separately. Certain types of neuropathic pain are much more intractable to treatment (e.g., central post-stroke pain), and drug combinations may be needed for optimal relief.​[^[5]]

While patients frequently report poor responses to previous pharmacologic treatment, clinicians should ensure an appropriate medication trial was attempted; too high or too low doses for too short a duration can be problematic. It may be useful to re-institute the drugs and evaluate their effectiveness when used appropriately: start low, go slow, increase dose until relief of symptoms or side effects occur, and treat side effects when possible. A trial of medication for 2–3 months is reasonable for neuropathic pain. If a drug is not effective, try different drugs within the same class, drugs of different classes or a combination of drugs for a possible additive or synergistic effect.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

See Table 4 for first-line treatment options according to type of neuropathic pain.

#### Chronic Neuropathic Pain

The Canadian Pain Society and other consistent American and European guidelines provide recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain based on RCTs.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]] There are strong recommendations for use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) and SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine).​[^[8]] There are weak recommendations for use of **topical** lidocaine, **topical** capsaicin, tramadol, strong opioids and **botulinum toxin** (topical agents and botulinum toxin are recommended only for peripheral neuropathic pain).​[^[8]] There is no evidence to support or refute a useful role for oral NSAIDs in neuropathic pain.​[^[10]] Various interventional treatments, such as epidural steroid injections, are offered by chronic pain clinics, although current evidence to support the efficacy of such treatments for neuropathic pain is lacking.​[^[11]]

#### Nerve Root Compression: Cervical and Lumbar Radiculopathy

The commonest form of neuropathic pain involves nerve root compression in the cervical and lumbar areas (usually C5 or C6 and L5 or S1) associated with degenerative change and disc herniation or scar tissue. In the acute phase, NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen may be effective (see Acute Pain). Where necessary, additional pain relief can be achieved with short-term opioids, an appropriate regimen of rest and avoidance of further aggravation. Other drugs used to treat other types of neuropathic pain have shown a lack of efficacy in treating pain due to nerve root compression, e.g., pregabalin.​[^[12]]

This pain often settles with conservative management. Investigate if pain does not resolve within a reasonable time frame or if this is the 1​[^st] episode in an elderly person (because of possible malignancy or other serious illness). Consider surgical treatment if medical treatment fails over 6–12 weeks and if neuroimaging with CT or MR shows a surgically treatable lesion, if acute pain is excruciating and intractable, or if a neurologic deficit and a correctable lesion are present. Signs of a progressive neurologic deficit such as weakness or muscle wasting should prompt urgent surgical consultation as early as possible.

#### Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain

The different types of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain are presented in Table 1. Although the evidence for the recommended therapeutic approaches is mainly from studies of patients with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, patients with phantom limb pain or other chronic peripheral neuropathic pain may derive benefit. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentinoids such as gabapentin and pregabalin, and SNRI antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine) are considered first-line agents (Figure 1, Table 6). When initiating pharmacotherapy, initial follow-up should be arranged in about 2 weeks and regularly thereafter for monitoring (see Investigations). Several RCTs indicate that pain may be taken from moderate or severe to mild in about one-half to two-thirds of patients by a TCA. In a systematic review, SNRIs were estimated to have an NNT of 6.4—meaning that about 1 of every 6 patients treated with the drugs would report clinically meaningful pain relief.​[^[8]] In this same review, gabapentinoids had an NNT of ~7 while TCAs had an estimated NNT of 3.6, suggesting better efficacy than SNRIs and gabapentinoids. However, TCAs are known to have a higher rate of troubling side effects.

Tramadol and **topical** lidocaine can be considered as second line. Combination therapy can be helpful.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[13]] Do not combine TCAs with SNRIs because of the potential risk of serotonin syndrome.​[^[14]]

Topical treatments may be helpful as adjunctive therapy combined with an oral analgesic, or as monotherapy for elderly patients if oral agents are not tolerated.​[^[8]]​[^[13]] Topical lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy for relief of neuropathic pain in several low-quality studies; however, a Cochrane review found no evidence from good-quality randomized controlled trials to support its use for neuropathic pain.​[^[15]] The majority of studies involved a transdermal patch, although some studies investigated the topical cream; the patch is not yet available in Canada. Other topical treatments, such as topical ASA, diclofenac,​[^[16]] menthol, clonidine,​[^[17]] doxepin,​[^[18]] isosorbide dinitrate spray​[^[19]] and capsaicin cream​[^[20]] require further study. A high-dose capsaicin patch (8%) demonstrated superior pain relief compared with capsaicin cream (0.025–0.075%), and similar rates of adverse events;​[^[21]] the capsaicin patch is not yet available in Canada.

In the current setting of the “opioid crisis,” i.e., an epidemic of opioid-related deaths, the routine use of opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain has come under much scrutiny. Various factors contributing to this opioid crisis are quite complex and beyond the scope of this chapter; however, this current situation emphasizes the need for careful patient selection as well as close supervision and follow-up when initiating opioid therapy.​[^[22]] Guidance for the use of opioids in this setting​[^[23]] is presented in Table 3. Tramadol can be used second line and other opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl can be used third line. Use smaller doses if combining with gabapentin or pregabalin, as such a combination can potentiate the risk of respiratory depression and death.​[^[22]]​[^[24]] When used alone or combined with acetaminophen, codeine is a poor choice for severe pain of any kind. Conversion of codeine to morphine in the liver is unreliable in individuals who are slow or rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers; there is also a group of ultra-rapid metabolizers, who are mainly from the horn of Africa. This variability in rate of conversion leads to poor pain control or increased risk of adverse effects in poor or ultra-rapid metabolizers, respectively. Products containing codeine as well as tramadol are no longer recommended for children under 12 years of age.​[^[25]]​[^[26]] Very rare cases of serious side effects and death in children have been attributed to codeine when given directly or ingested by infants via breast milk.

If pain persists, use a trial-and-error approach with a variety of drugs including cannabinoids (e.g., dronabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol), methadone, tapentadol, lamotrigine, topiramate and **botulinum toxin** injections by a specialist. Cannabinoids have been studied mainly in pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Current guidelines are inconsistent when it comes to cannabinoids' place in neuropathic pain treatment.​[^[7]]​[^[8]] Methadone may be useful when refractory chronic neuropathic pain co-exists with opioid dependency; it requires prescribing authorization and specialized knowledge, and should be used only by experienced clinicians. Avoid meperidine, as chronic use can lead to an accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine and cause excitotoxicity such as myoclonus and seizures.

| Consider opioids after other drug and non-drug therapies have failed.Perform a complete pain and psychosocial history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic tests. A history of substance abuse, tension-type headaches, frequent migraine headache, muscular pain (myofascial pain, fibromyalgia) or pain that appears to be largely determined by psychologic factors is a relative contraindication to the use of opioid therapy.Screen with the Opioid Risk ToolA single physician/prescriber/pharmacy is optimal. Set up a contract with the patient. The agreement should specify the drug regimen, possible side effects, the functional restoration program and that violations may result in termination of opioid therapy.The opioid analgesic of choice can be administered around the clock and include a provision of “rescue doses” for breakthrough pain. Controlled-release preparations can be considered and include morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, tramadol and transdermal fentanyl. In general practice, keep dose to 50–90 mg morphine equivalents daily (MED). Refer to a specialist above that dose. Avoid meperidine primarily because of accumulation of its excitotoxic metabolite normeperidine. Codeine is a poor analgesic for moderate to severe pain because it has to be metabolized to morphine. Drug administration should include a titration phase to minimize side effects. If a graded analgesic response to incremental doses is not observed, the patient may not be opioid-responsive, and opioid treatment should probably be terminated.The patient should be seen monthly or more often for the first few months and every 2–3 months thereafter. Use the Opioid Manager. At each visit, assess pain relief (0–10 scale), mood, side effects, function (Brief Pain Inventory), quality of life, adherence to functional goals and presence of drug-related behaviour. Optimally, affix a copy of the prescription and drug therapy flow sheet to the medical record.The goal of opioid therapy is to make the pain tolerable. For some patients with chronic noncancer pain (e.g., postherpetic neuralgia), the administration of an opioid analgesic can mean the difference between bearable and unbearable pain. |


#### Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type Ι​[27]

Complex regional pain syndrome type Ι (CRPS I), formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or sympathetically maintained pain, is thought to be neuropathic pain with neurovascular and dystrophic changes. It may result from penetrating or crush injuries to nerves but sometimes occurs after stroke or MI. Characteristics include burning pain, wide nonanatomical area of allodynia, hyperesthesia, dysesthesia, hyperalgesia and hyperpathia (see Table 2), sweating, rubor, and coldness of the affected limb. When clearly associated with nerve injury, it is referred to as CRPS II, known historically as causalgia and treated as chronic peripheral neuropathic pain (see Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain).

If CRPS I symptoms persist for a few months, the patient may experience a widening of the painful area, cool cyanotic skin, a glossy appearance to the skin, altered hair growth and progressive loss of function. Some patients will progress to dystrophic changes, osteoporosis, nail changes, subcutaneous thinning with pointed digits, and further loss of function with contractures or frozen shoulder and continued severe pain.

While CRPS I was thought to be due to sympathetic overactivity, evidence now points to a disorder involving upregulation of adrenergic receptors. Although sympathetic blocks often provide temporary relief, sympathectomy does not necessarily result in permanent resolution. Bier blocks using guanethidine are ineffective. Physical therapy, corticosteroids, sympathectomies and repeated sympathetic blocks have limited success. At follow-up, two-thirds of patients are likely to have continued pain, and only about 25% return to fully normal activity. These patients may benefit from the same agents used to treat neuropathic pain; some may require chronic opioid therapy. 

#### Acute Neuropathic Pain—Herpes Zoster​[28]

Herpes zoster vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia​[^[29]]​[^[30]] are available in Canada. More information on these vaccines and their efficacy can be found in Herpesvirus Infections. 

The varicella-zoster virus lies dormant in dorsal root ganglia following initial infection; risk factors for reactivation include age (>50 years) and decreased immunologic competence. Severe or stabbing pain and dysesthesia are soon followed by vesicular eruption in the affected dermatomes—thoracic and cranial dermatomes are affected in about 50% and 15% of cases, respectively. Pain may precede the rash by days or radicular (nerve root) pain may occur with no rash (zoster sine herpete), making diagnosis difficult. Motor deficits occur in more severe cases. When herpes zoster affects the forehead, observe for eye complications and refer to an ophthalmologist when necessary, as blindness and loss of the eye may occur. 

 Early treatment of herpes zoster can reduce the severity of the rash and pain of the acute infection; however, evidence that antivirals will prevent postherpetic neuralgia is limited.​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] Oral antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) are most effective if started within 72 hours of the onset of the rash. Even if the rash has not appeared, the sudden occurrence of severe, acute neuropathic pain unilaterally in the forehead or thoracic area in an individual over 60 years of age is reasonable cause to initiate antiviral drug therapy, since these agents are safe and well tolerated. For prescribing information see Herpesvirus Infections.

In addition to instituting an antiviral agent, it is important to relieve the acute pain. This may be accomplished with early treatment with amitriptyline and/or gabapentin and, if necessary, opioids or nerve blocks. In the management of acute herpes virus infections, corticosteroid therapy may improve quality of life (resolution of acute neuritis, uninterrupted sleep and return to normal activity) but does not accelerate healing or reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.​[^[34]]​[^[35]] Limit use of corticosteroids to healthy patients with moderate to severe pain. Corticosteroids increase the risk of immunosuppression and may not be appropriate for certain high-risk patients, e.g., elderly, immunosuppressed, patients with diabetes, hypertension or GI ulcer.

The risk of chronic postherpetic neuralgia increases with age and with severity of the eruption. Management of postherpetic neuralgia is described in Chronic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain.

#### Trigeminal Neuralgia​[36]

 Trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, is different from other neuropathic pain and its therapy differs both pharmacologically (see Table 7) and surgically. Trigeminal neuralgia is confined to the face, shows a predilection for the 2​[^nd] or 3​[^rd] trigeminal divisions, is brought on by tactile stimuli in trigger areas such as the nasolabial region, and is electric shock–like in quality. Almost always unilateral, it generally afflicts persons over 50 years of age and often follows a remitting course. Trigeminal neuralgia usually responds to carbamazepine, a treatment that is generally not effective for other types of neuropathic pain unless there is a shock-like component.​[^[6]] The sustained-release formulation is given every 8–12 hours and may improve adherence, lessen untoward effects and provide a more sustained effect. See Table 7 for more information regarding monitoring parameters. Measuring serum levels is not necessary but can be useful if there is a need to assess adherence or a concern regarding toxicity. Oxcarbazepine may have advantages over carbamazepine, from which it is derived, in that it is given twice daily and may have fewer side effects and drug interactions.​[^[37]] Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of these 2 agents are lacking; oxcarbazepine appears to have a higher propensity to cause hyponatremia.

Clinical experience has shown that other pharmacologic approaches are inferior to carbamazepine, but may be helpful as adjunctive therapy. If some relief is achieved with carbamazepine but side effects are unacceptable, a good strategy is to switch to oxcarbazepine or reduce the dose of carbamazepine to tolerability and add baclofen.​[^[38]] Gabapentin, pregabalin, clonazepam and valproic acid may be tried if other strategies fail.

If medical therapy is insufficient, a variety of neurosurgical options have a high success rate in experienced hands. Procedures include potentially curative microvascular decompression, ablative procedures such as glycerol instillation or balloon compression of the gasserian ganglion, and the gamma knife. MRI may or may not show a vascular loop and can help identify candidates for microvascular decompression by ruling out other causes of 5​[^th] nerve compression. There is a risk of recurrence with all ablative surgeries and a <10 % risk of anesthesia dolorosa (nerve injury pain caused by surgery) with all procedures.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Management of Neuropathic Pain during Pregnancy

When possible, use nonpharmacologic measures to manage neuropathic pain during pregnancy and avoid the use of any pharmacologic options. If drug therapy is deemed necessary, consider the risks and benefits of each drug to ensure an informed decision is made. Of the antidepressants, the tricyclics such as amitriptyline appear relatively safe and are probably preferred.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] While SNRIs such as venlafaxine​[^[39]] and duloxetine are not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, they are less effective than tricyclics for neuropathic pain.​[^[45]] Venlafaxine has been associated with short-term neurobehavioural symptoms (e.g., agitation, jitteriness, poor feeding) in the neonate.​[^[39]]

Significant systemic absorption after topical use of lidocaine is not expected, and its use during pregnancy appears to be safe.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

There are limited data regarding baclofen in pregnancy.​[^[39]]

Carbamazepine is associated with an increased risk of major and minor malformations including neural tube defects.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] Less is known about the safety of oxcarbazepine during pregnancy. If carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are used during pregnancy, daily oral supplementation with a multivitamin containing 1 mg folic acid should be instated at least 3 months prior to conception and continued until 12 weeks' gestational age. From then and continuing through the pregnancy until 4–6 weeks postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues, a daily supplementation with a multivitamin containing 0.4–1 mg folic acid should be maintained.​[^[46]] 

Clonazepam is probably safe in pregnancy after the 1​[^st] trimester.​[^[39]] Valproic acid is not recommended during pregnancy because of the increased risk of neural tube defects.​[^[39]] Until more is known about the safety of gabapentin or pregabalin, avoid these agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain during pregnancy.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[47]]

Opioid use during the 1​[^st] trimester has been associated with a small increase in absolute risk of congenital heart defects and spina bifida;​[^[48]] however, some experts still consider them safe.​[^[49]] They may also depress respiratory and GI function and cause sedation and/or withdrawal syndromes in the newborn if taken near term.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] In patients taking high doses of opioids for chronic noncancer pain, the risks to the fetus are not known. Neonatal withdrawal has also been reported after long-term tramadol treatment in the pregnant mother.​[^[50]]​[^[51]]

#### Management of Neuropathic Pain during Breastfeeding

Although the effect of TCAs on lactation and breastfeeding is mostly unknown, their use during breastfeeding is not expected to cause any adverse effects to the infant.​[^[39]]​[^[52]] In mothers taking SNRIs, monitor breastfed infants for drowsiness, adequate weight gain and developmental milestones.​[^[52]]

Topical lidocaine is not expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants.​[^[52]] Ensure infant skin does not come into contact with treated areas of the mother.

Baclofen is thought to be compatible with breastfeeding,​[^[39]] although breastfed newborns should be monitored for signs of sedation.​[^[52]]

Both carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are thought to be compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

Clonazepam is transferred into breast milk, poorly metabolized by the neonate and may cause sedation in the breastfed infant.​[^[52]] Chronic use of benzodiazepines in breastfeeding mothers is discouraged. Valproic acidis considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[52]] Gabapentin is transferred into breast milk, producing low levels in the infant's serum.​[^[40]]​[^[52]] The infant should be monitored for drowsiness, adequate weight gain and developmental milestones.​[^[52]] Until more is known about the safety of pregabalin, avoid this agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain while the mother is breastfeeding.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]

When infants are exposed to opioids or tramadol through breast milk, monitor for possible GI or CNS depressant effects and changes in feeding patterns.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[52]] Health Canada and the US FDA advise against the use of codeine during breastfeeding unless the benefits outweigh the risks.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Controversy exists in the interpretation of the case report that was one of the bases of the recommendation.​[^[43]]​[^[44]] Until the controversy is resolved, it may be reasonable to limit use of codeine in breastfeeding mothers.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Management of the Frail Elderly

General cautions in the elderly are to start with the lowest dose, monitor frequently and titrate up very slowly with minimum doses to reasonable relief or side effects. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics (e.g., decreased clearance) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., increased sensitivity to CNS-active drugs) must be taken into consideration.​[^[53]] Goals of therapy should include improvement in functional status; pain's impact on functioning (activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living) should be assessed.​[^[53]] In elders with a history of falls or fractures, minimizing the number of CNS-active drugs (e.g., antidepressants, opioids, antiepileptics) is advised.​[^[54]] Careful attention must also be paid to avoid combining multiple drugs with anticholinergic properties, which may cause adverse effects to which elders are particularly sensitive, e.g., constipation, impaired cognition.​[^[54]] See Table 5 for precautions in the elderly specific to drugs commonly used to treat neuropathic pain.

| Drug Class | Precaution |
| --- | --- |
| Antiepileptics | May exacerbate or cause SIADH; monitor sodium closely when starting or changing dosages​[54]Potentially inappropriate in patients with a history of falls or fractures: may cause ataxia, impaired psychomotor function, syncope, additional falls​[54] |

Caution with drugs that lower seizure threshold, e.g., SSRIs, TCAs, bupropion. Increased sedation with other CNS depressants. Carbamazepine may decrease analgesic effect of tramadol. Clearance of tramadol (and conversion to its active M1 metabolite) may be decreased by inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine or quinidine, increasing the risk of seizures or serotonin syndrome. Clearance may also be reduced by inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, itraconazole or ketoconazole. |  |

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **carbamazepine immediate-release** (Tegretol, generics) | Initial: 100 mg BID–QID POIncrease by 100 mg daily at weekly intervals to 400–1200 mg/day or more, in 2–4 divided doses, until good pain control or intolerable side effectsGive doses before meals | Drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness, nausea, hyponatremia; allergic reactions, e.g., rash; hepatitis (rare) or bone marrow suppression (rare). | Induces several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, potentially increases the clearance of many drugs, such as OCs, warfarin, risperidone or TCAs; clearance may be reduced by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole or ketoconazole. | To improve detection of rare idiosyncratic reactions that usually occur in the first 3 months, complete blood count, electrolytes and liver function tests are suggested every 1–2 wk during that time.Consider genetic testing for allelic variations in patients from populations genetically at risk for such variations, e.g., Asian ancestry. |
| **carbamazepine controlled-release** (Tegretol, generics) | Initial: 100 mg Q8–12H POIncrease at weekly intervals as needed to 400–1200 mg daily in 2 divided doses | Drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness, nausea, hyponatremia; allergic reactions, e.g., rash; hepatitis (rare) or bone marrow suppression (rare). | Induces several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, potentially increases the clearance of many drugs, such as OCs, warfarin, risperidone or TCAs; clearance may be reduced by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole or ketoconazole. | To improve detection of rare idiosyncratic reactions that usually occur in the first 3 months, complete blood count, electrolytes and liver function tests are suggested every 1–2 wk during that time.Consider genetic testing for allelic variations in patients from populations genetically at risk for such variations, e.g., Asian ancestry. |
| **clonazepam** (Rivotril, generics) | Initial: 1.5 mg/day POMaximum: 20 mg/day | Sedation. | Additive sedation with CNS depressants such as alcohol and opioids; avoid combination with opioids due to increased risk of respiratory depression; serum levels potentially increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, lamotrigine, ritonavir or verapamil, or reduced by inducers of CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampin. | Important to discontinue gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms. |
| **divalproex sodium** (Epival, Apo-Divalproex, other generics) | Initial: 250 mg BID PO; increase by 250 mg/day every 3–4 days as necessary Usual maintenance: 750–1000 mg/day in 2–4 divided doses | Nausea, alopecia, tremor, weight gain, increased hepatic enzymes. | Inhibits CYP2C9 and may reduce clearance of its substrates, such as fluoxetine, fluvastatin, sertraline, verapamil or warfarin; avoid with ASA or warfarin; carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital can significantly increase clearance of valproic acid; may increase depressant effect of alcohol. | Do not use for neuropathic pain in pregnancy due to increased risk of neural tube defects.Perform liver function tests prior to initiation of therapy and periodically, especially during first 6 months of therapy and if symptoms of hepatic dysfunction occur. |
| **oxcarbazepine** (Trileptal, generics) | Initial: 75–150 mg BID PO Maximum: 1200 mg/day | Drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness, nausea, hyponatremia; allergic reactions, e.g., rash; hepatitis (rare) or bone marrow suppression (rare). Hyponatremia may be more common than with carbamazepine, especially in younger patients. | Induces several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, potentially increases the clearance of many drugs, such as OCs, warfarin, risperidone or TCAs; clearance may be reduced by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole or ketoconazole.May have lower propensity for drug interactions than carbamazepine, but comparative trials are lacking. | To improve detection of rare idiosyncratic reactions that usually occur in the first 3 months, complete blood count, electrolytes and liver function tests are suggested every 1–2 wk during that time.Consider genetic testing for allelic variations in patients from populations genetically at risk for such variations, e.g., Asian ancestry.Possible alternative to carbamazepine: similar efficacy; generally fewer side effects. |
| **valproic acid** (Depakene, Apo-Valproic, other generics) | Initial: 125 mg BID PO; increase by 250 mg/day every 1–2 wk as necessaryUsual maintenance: 750–1000 mg/day in 2–4 divided doses | Nausea, alopecia, tremor, weight gain, increased hepatic enzymes. | Inhibits CYP2C9 and may reduce clearance of its substrates, such as fluoxetine, fluvastatin, sertraline, verapamil or warfarin; avoid with ASA or warfarin; carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital can significantly increase clearance of valproic acid; may increase depressant effect of alcohol. | Do not use for neuropathic pain in pregnancy due to increased risk of neural tube defects.Perform liver function tests prior to initiation of therapy and periodically, especially during first 6 months of therapy and if symptoms of hepatic dysfunction occur. |
| **gabapentin** (Neurontin, Gabapentin Capsules, Gabapentin Tablets, other generics) | Initial: 300–400 mg/day PO HSMay increase at weekly intervals to BID then TID Maximum: 3600 mg/day in divided doses | Sedation, ataxia, tremor; less commonly, GI upset, peripheral edema, vision changes, weight gain. | Potentiates risk of respiratory depression and death when combined with opioids.Administration with aluminum/magnesium-containing antacids may decrease bioavailability. | Not a Health Canada–approved indication.Useful as add on or as monotherapy if carbamazepine is not tolerated or contraindicated, but not nearly as effective as carbamazepine; only 30% will have at least moderate (50%) relief. |
| **pregabalin** (Lyrica, Pregabalin, other generics) | Initial: 50–150 mg/day PO in 2 divided dosesIncrease dose weekly by 50–150 mg/dayUsual effective dose: 300–600 mg/day (doses greater than 300 mg/day may have little further benefit for pain)Maximum: 600 mg/day | Sedation, ataxia, peripheral edema, diplopia, weight gain, dry mouth. | No known significant drug interactions; caution when used with opioids as it may potentiate risks of respiratory depression and death. | BID dosing is an advantage over gabapentin. Efficacy is similar to gabapentin. |
| **baclofen** (Lioresal Oral, Baclofen, other generics) | Initial: 10 mg BID POMaximum: 20 mg TID | Sedation, muscle weakness, nausea, dizziness. | Potential additive CNS depression with benzodiazepines, opioids, TCAs and some antihypertensive agents. | Gradual withdrawal is important to minimize the potential for seizures.
