CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Introduction

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in patients of childbearing age refers to any change in menses that includes an abnormal frequency, duration, amount of blood flow or bleeding that occurs between cycles. AUB can occur chronically or may be an acute situation warranting immediate intervention. AUB also includes unpredictable bleeding in postmenopausal patients. This chapter focuses on menorrhagia associated with menses, which has been replaced by the term heavy menstrual bleeding.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is AUB that is characterized by excessive menstrual blood flow that interferes with quality of life and may result in iron deficiency anemia.​[^[1]] Recent definitions of HMB focus more on the patient’s perception of the impact of abnormal bleeding on the quality of life than volume of blood loss.​[^[2]] HMB is an important cause of absenteeism from work or school in patients of childbearing age and poses a significant cost burden to the individual and to the health-care system.​[^[3]] Thirty percent of patients consider their menstrual bleeding to be excessive.​[^[4]] 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Patients with HMB may present with prolonged menses and/or heavy bleeding with flooding, large clots or symptoms of anemia. The etiology of HMB includes structural and functional causes, as classified by the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO); see Table 1.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Structural Causes | Functional Causes |
| Polyps (endometrial or endocervical)Adenomyosis (endometrial glands/stroma within the myometrium)Leiomyomas (fibroids; submucosal or other)Malignancy and hyperplasia | Coagulopathy (congenital or acquired)Ovulatory dysfunction (adolescence, polycystic ovarian syndrome, perimenopause, hyper/hypothyroidism, eating disorder, hyperprolactinemia)Endometrial factors (dysregulation of local endometrial “hemostasis”)Iatrogenic (hormones, intrauterine systems)Not otherwise classified (arteriovenous malformations, uterine scars from cesarean section) |

#### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of HMB is presented in Figure 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Surgical Options

Pharmacologic therapy is generally considered to be the first line of treatment for HMB, unless these therapies are contraindicated or undesired. Surgical options become an important consideration, particularly in patients who do not desire to become pregnant and in those who have failed medical management. 

*Hysterectomy* is the definitive treatment of HMB and continues to be a cost-effective alternative for many patients.​[^[9]] Hysterectomy is associated with the highest degree of patient satisfaction and quality of life-years.​[^[10]] New technologies have facilitated options for minimally invasive hysterectomy, including vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, robotic hysterectomy and mini-laparotomy. These techniques are continuing to evolve, and information directing optimal patient selection for each technique is still incomplete. The type of hysterectomy depends on the presence or absence of uterine pathology, availability of specialized equipment, expertise of the surgeon, patient preference and surgical risk. *Endometrial ablation* is a minimally invasive, uterine-preserving option that involves the use of laser, electrocautery, resection or heating methods to destroy the lining of the uterus and leave it devoid of the endometrium. The use of hysteroscopic endometrial ablation is highly effective, with 87–97% of patients reporting a reduction in bleeding.​[^[2]]​[^[11]] The need for further operative intervention is 6–20% within 5 years of follow-up.​[^[2]] In patients with normal uterine cavities, global ablation may be preferable to hysteroscopic endometrial resection because of its safety, shorter operative time and ease of use in an outpatient setting.​[^[2]]

For patients who prefer fertility preservation, other surgical methods should be employed. *Uterine artery embolization* and *uterine myomectomy* may be considered for the treatment of AUB related to fibroids or adenomyosis. *Hysteroscopic endometrial resection* should be offered for definitive treatment of small submucous fibroids and endometrial polyps. 

#### Pharmacologic Choices

 Select drug therapies for the management of HMB are presented in Table 2.

#### Hormonal Therapies

#### Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

 **Combined hormonal** contraceptives containing **estrogen** and **progestin** are an effective and well-tolerated treatment for HMB through the suppression of the HPO axis. A variety of oral products as well as the transdermal patch and vaginal ring are available in Canada. These preparations act by suppressing FSH and inhibiting follicular development. As a result, ovarian estrogen secretion and endometrial proliferation are minimized. Most patients are able to achieve good cycle control and a substantial reduction in menstrual blood loss with minimal side effects​[^[2]] (see Contraception).

#### Progestogen-Only Contraceptives

The term *progestogen* includes both natural progesterone and synthetic progestins. A variety of **progestogen-only **contraceptives are available (oral, intramuscular, subdermal and intrauterine forms) and can be used in the treatment of HMB. These preparations act in a variety of ways by suppressing ovulation and antagonizing the proliferative effect of estrogen at the level of the endometrium. Uterine bleeding may be eliminated completely with continuous progestogen administration. A progestogen contraception that has long been used to induce amenorrhea and to treat HMB is injectable **depot** medroxyprogesterone **acetate** (DMPA). Although the oral “mini-pill” (norethindrone) may induce amenorrhea in some patients, it is associated with irregular and unpredictable blood loss.​[^[2]]​[^[12]] 

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) delivering 20 mcg/day is a first-line treatment option approved by Health Canada for idiopathic HMB. The device is more effective than other medical therapies in AUB,​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] has reduced rates of hysterectomies​[^[16]] and is comparable to endometrial ablation in terms of patient satisfaction, quality of life and sexual functioning.​[^[13]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] The LNG-IUS reduces blood flow by approximately 97% in the first year of use and provides reversible contraception and effective control of bleeding for up to 5 years.​[^[19]] It has been used with success for HMB due to fibroids and adenomyosis, although uterine cavity distortion may preclude its use in these conditions.​[^[20]]​[^[12]] Alternative LNG-IUS with lower dosing options can also induce amenorrhea and reduce blood loss, but the effect is dose-related and these products have not been extensively evaluated for this purpose.​[^[21]]

The single rod etonogestrel (ENG) implant is now available in Canada. Like other progestin-only, long-acting reversible contraceptives, the implant works by continuously (over a period of 3 years) releasing a low-dose of progestin (etonogestrel), therefore inhibiting ovulation. Etonogestrel is associated with significant reduction in menstrual blood volume in patients with adenomyosis or endometriosis.​[^[22]]

Patients who do not require contraception may try an extended-cycle regimen of oral medroxyprogesterone **acetate**, **micronized** progesterone or norethindrone **acetate** taken for at least 21 days per month (days 5–26 of cycle). Luteal-phase progesterone, i.e., 10–14 days per month, is a less effective option and is generally not recommended.​[^[2]] The progestogen-only oral preparations are inferior to the combined contraceptive products in their ability to produce regular menstrual cycles.​[^[9]] Side effects of progestogens include breast tenderness, weight gain and emotional liability. In general, the oral progestogen regimens offer no advantage over nonhormonal medical options for treatment of HMB.

#### Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists and Antagonists

Suppression of the pituitary gland may be achieved using **gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists**, such as leuprolide, goserelin and nafarelin. Follicular development does not occur because FSH is suppressed. As a result, the endometrium does not proliferate and amenorrhea occurs. GnRH agonists are very effective in the short-term treatment of HMB and also can be used to shrink fibroids.​[^[23]] Vasomotor symptoms are common side effects. Treatment beyond 6 months is not advisable without estrogen/progestogen add-back therapy to preserve bone health.​[^[2]]

Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist indicated for the management of endometriosis-associated pain that has been shown to reduce HMB in patients with uterine fibroids or leiomyomas.​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Add-back estrogen/progestogen therapy reduces hypoestrogenic effects. Long-term safety data is lacking.

#### Antifibrinolytics

Medications that inhibit fibrinolytic activity in the endometrium are useful in the treatment of both acute and chronic HMB. Intermittent regular dosing of oral tranexamic acid can be helpful for patients with heavy periods who do not wish to use hormonal treatments.​[^[26]] The mechanism of action appears to be related to reversible inhibition of lysine-binding sites on plasminogen. 

#### Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

NSAIDs may decrease menstrual blood loss by inhibiting prostacyclin-mediated vasodilation in the basalis layer of the endometrium. Regular dosing reduces blood flow through the spiral arteries and is an effective treatment for HMB. It is an option for patients who wish to avoid exogenous hormones. It is particularly useful in patients presenting with dysmenorrhea as well as HMB, and can be started the day before menses and continued until bleeding ceases (usually 3–5 days). The use of NSAIDs is contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders. NSAIDs are superior to placebo but less effective than some medical therapies, including tranexamic acid and danazol.​[^[26]]​[^[27]]

#### Other

Menstrual cycle suppression and relief from HMB may be achieved using danazol 100–400 mg daily. However, the potential for androgenic side effects makes this option unattractive to many patients.​[^[28]]

 Progesterone receptor modulators have been tried for the management of HMB. Ulipristal has been shown to be effective when used to reduce blood loss in the presence of uterine fibroids, but is not as effective as GnRH agonists in reducing fibroid volume.​[^[23]] However, due to reports of serious liver toxicity requiring liver transplant, the manufacturer of ulipristal acetate voluntarily withdrew it from the Canadian market in October 2020.​[^[29]] *Patients being treated with ulipristal should stop the medication and immediately contact a health-care practitioner if they experience signs and symptoms of liver injury. Liver function tests must be conducted within 2–4 weeks of drug cessation. Abnormal liver function tests warrant further investigation.*

 There is also some evidence that mifepristone, another progesterone receptor modulator, reduces heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.​[^[30]] Mifepristone is not available in Canada, except as a combination product with misoprostol for the termination of a pregnancy.

#### Acute Bleeding

Acute menstrual bleeding involves life-threatening blood loss that requires immediate intervention to maintain hemodynamic stability, minimize patient morbidity and reduce the need for blood transfusion.​[^[2]] See Table 3 for pharmacologic options used in the treatment of acute menstrual bleeding.

High dose IV **conjugated** estrogen**s** have been used to reduce blood loss. They stimulate rapid proliferation of the endometrium, covering the exposed spiral arteries. Conjugated estrogen administration must be followed by progestogen or combined hormonal contraceptive administration in order to stabilize the endometrium and promote organized sloughing upon withdrawal.​[^[1]]

High-dose **progestogens**, e.g., medroxyprogesterone **acetate**, may be effective in the management of acute uterine bleeding.​[^[31]]

IV tranexamic acid can also be used in acute bleeding.​[^[2]]

If patients have contraindications to medical management (e.g., high risk of thrombosis), have failed to respond or are in situations where they are clinically unstable, surgical management is indicated. The surgical approach, which includes dilation and curettage, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, or hysterectomy should be tailored to the patient and consider future fertility.​[^[32]]
