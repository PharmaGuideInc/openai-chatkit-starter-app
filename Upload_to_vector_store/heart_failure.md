#### Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by different etiologies and pathophysiology. Regardless of the cause, it is generally recognized by a cluster of signs and symptoms including dyspnea, fluid retention, fatigue, and some form of structural or functional heart disease corroborated by either elevated natriuretic peptide levels or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HF is dynamic; symptoms and disease trajectory may change over time and have periods of remission. The most common causes of HF include hypertension, ischemic heart disease and valvular heart disease.​[^[1]]

HF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.​[^[2]] Its prevalence continues to increase secondary to aging populations with comorbidities and better treatment of acute cardiovascular events. It is associated with significant health-care costs and portends a poor prognosis for patients. Annual mortality rates for HF range between 6–25%, depending on symptoms and hospitalizations. 

HF can be categorized in several ways. Most commonly, it is categorized according to left ventricular systolic function by measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (see Table 1). The majority of HF is heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmEF) and heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) are newer classifications with evolving clinical implications. It is estimated that about 50% of cases are HFrEF.​[^[1]]

| Classification | Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Measurement |
| --- | --- |
| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) | HF + LVEF ≤40% |
| Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmEF) | HF + LVEF 41–49% |
| Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) | HF + LVEF ≥50% |
| Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) | HF with baseline EF ≤40% + >10 point increase from baseline EF + second measurement >40% |


 HFrEF is characterized by decreased pump function (systolic function), dilatation of the left ventricle and decreased LVEF. Most clinical trials have been conducted in patients with HFrEF. 

HFpEF is characterized by abnormal myocardial relaxation (diastolic function), nondilated left ventricular with concentric remodelling, or left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement and a normal or mildly abnormal LVEF. HFpEF risk factors are older age, female sex/female sex assigned at birth, obesity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea and diabetes. Diagnosis remains challenging, and treatment is limited but evolving.​[^[4]] Potentially treatable etiologies include infiltrative, restrictive, inflammatory or genetic cardiomyopathies. These are beyond the scope of this chapter.

HFmEF is poorly classified and may overlap with other categories as a precursor to HFrEF or decompensated HFpEF. More data are required on prognosis and appropriate treatments.​[^[3]]​[^[5]]

Data on HFimpEF is also limited. This category attempts to classify patients that have had an improvement or normalization in the LVEF from HFrEF. Some patients in this group may be in “remission” but still have structural abnormalities or may have “recovered” with a treated reversible cause of HF and have no remaining visible structural abnormalities. This is a very heterogeneous group, and treatment strategies will vary depending on the clinical scenario.​[^[3]]

| Symptoms of HF | Signs of HF |
| --- | --- |
| Typical | More specific |
| Bendopnea | Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) |
| Cough | Hepatojugular reflux (HJR) |
| Dyspnea | Laterally displaced apical impulse |
| Exercise intolerance | Third heart sound (S3) |
| Fatigue | Less specific |
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) | Cold extremities |
| Orthopnea | Peripheral edema |
|  | Pulmonary rales |
|  | Tachycardia |
|  | Unintentional weight gain (>2 kg/wk) |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

The diagnosis of HF includes a detailed clinical history, evaluation of signs and symptoms (Table 2, Table 3), and initial investigations, including laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging. 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Age | Atrial fibrillation |
| Dyslipidemia | Chemotherapy |
| Hypertension | Chest radiation |
| Ischemic heart disease | Family history of cardiomyopathy |
| Obesity | Substance abuse: alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines |
| Smoking | Valvular heart disease |


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Patient-Specific Factors | Nonadherence to drug therapy or dietary restrictionsAnemiaArrhythmiasInfectionsMyocardial ischemiaPulmonary embolismRenal dysfunctionThyroid dysfunctionUncontrolled hypertensionValvular heart disease |
| Drugs​[7] | Drugs that cause sodium and fluid retention:AndrogensCorticosteroidsDrugs with high sodium contentLicorice-containing productsMinoxidilNSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors and high-dose salicylatesPregabalinThiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone)Negative inotropes:Antiarrhythmic agents except amiodarone and dofetilideBeta-blockersItraconazoleNon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers​[8]Some anesthesia medications, e.g., propofolCardiotoxic drugs:AlcoholAmphetaminesCancer therapies: 5-fluorouracil, alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide), anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone), bevacizumab, trastuzumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, sunitinib)ClozapineCocaine |




The use of natriuretic peptide (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro BNP [NT-proBNP]) tests are particularly useful if the diagnosis of HF is unclear as they provide for a “rule in” or “rule out” scenario (Table 5). In patients with clear signs and symptoms of HF, the use of natriuretic peptide is less useful.

Once a clinical diagnosis of HF is made, echocardiography should be performed in all patients to assess ventricular size and function, including LVEF, and to assess other structures such as cardiac valves (see Figure 1). Additional testing, including cardiac MRI and cardiac catheterization, may be done to determine specific etiology and select targeted treatment. 

|  | Cuff-off points (pg/mL) | BNP | NT-proBNP | Age <50 | Age 50–75 | Age >75 | Age <50 | Age 50–75 | Age >75 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HF Unlikely | <100 | <300 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| HF Possible | 100–400 | 300–450 | 300–900 | 300–1800 |  |  |  |  |  |
| HF Very Likely | >400 | >450 | >900 | >1800 |  |  |  |  |  |


#### Therapeutic Choices

Treatment decisions will depend on the underlying etiology of HF, LVEF and symptoms, often described as New York Heart Association Functional Class (see Table 6). Treatment can include decongestion, acute exacerbation supportive therapy (inotropic support or afterload reduction) and/or chronic maintenance therapy (LV remodelling, neurohormonal blockade, risk factor modification).

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices​[6]​[9]​[10]



| Class | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| I | No symptoms​[a] with ordinary activity |
| II | Symptoms occur with ordinary activity |
| III | Symptoms occur with less than ordinary activity |
| IV | Symptoms occur at rest or with minimal activity |


#### Device Therapy

Given their cost, the following devices should generally be reserved for patients who do not have significant comorbidities that are expected to significantly limit survival.



#### Reperfusion and Surgery



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Diuretics

Assessment of fluid status in patients with HF is a cornerstone of management. The fluid status of patients with HF is dynamic and variable and should be reassessed regularly. The degree of congestion or fluid overload may vary significantly over time but generally worsens as HF progresses. Regardless of the etiology or classification of HF, the approach to diuresis is the same with the goal being achieving and maintaining euvolemia.

Diuretics are used to control signs and symptoms of volume overload. Some patients require only intermittent diuretics and others need chronic therapy. Therefore, the dose of diuretic should be reassessed regularly, with the goal to use the minimum effective dose.​[^[10]] It is important to highlight that although diuretics are extremely effective in reducing symptoms, they do not modify the natural course of HF and do not decrease mortality. Furthermore, overdiuresis may exacerbate renal dysfunction and/or impact the tolerance of other drugs given to improve HF outcomes (e.g., exacerbate hypotension).

Diuresis in HF usually requires the use of a potent **loop diuretic**, commonly furosemide. The dose and route (IV or PO) of diuretic is dependent on several factors including degree of congestion, urgency of decongestion, renal function (lower eGFR requiring higher doses to penetrate the glomeruli), BP, diuretic history and response, and the setting in which it is being administered (inpatient or outpatient). IV formulations may be selected in cases where rapid diuresis is required or in cases where patients may not be responding to oral diuretics (e.g., diuretic resistance or poor absorption due to GI tract edema). Dosing can be daily or multiple times per day, depending on the amount of diuresis required. Doses should be given early in the day to avoid nighttime diuresis and sleep disturbance.

In patients with refractory volume overload, consider the addition of a low-dose **thiazide** intermittently (e.g., a few times/week) to a loop diuretic.​[^[6]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]] The addition of a thiazide counteracts reabsorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule, which increases with chronic loop diuretic use. This strategy should be used only by experienced clinicians with close monitoring of weight, renal function and serum potassium because of the risk of severe and potentially fatal dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.​[^[6]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]] Metolazone is usually used in this context, but other thiazides, such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, have been tried at doses higher than those used in hypertension.

In terms of monitoring, symptoms can improve within hours or days depending on the route and level of congestion. It is important to monitor both signs and symptoms of congestion and recognize that peripheral edema commonly resolves after pulmonary decongestion. Diuretics (loop and thiazide) are associated with electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hyponatremia. Serum potassium should be maintained at ≥4 mmol/L because hypokalemia increases the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias and digoxin toxicity.​[^[6]] Renal function should also be monitored to assess for overdiuresis. It should be noted that poor perfusion from HF can worsen renal function but can subsequently improve with adequate diuresis. Diuretics are also known to increase uric acid levels and may predispose patients to gout; NSAIDS should be avoided if gout treatment is required.

#### Agents to Treat Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction

There has been a recent shift in guidelines, advocating for early initiation of quadruple therapy, including angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or ACEI/ARB, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.​[^[13]] The focus is on starting all 4 classes and then subsequent uptitration to target or maximally tolerated doses, with a goal to optimize in 3–6 months.

 There is no preference to order of initiation or uptitration; the approach should be individualized based on patient preference, side effect profile, affordability and comorbidities. There is no proven superior approach to initiation or titration. This strategy is regardless of current HF symptoms and NYHA classification and should be applied to the majority of HFrEF patients (see Figure 2). Preference should be given to the use of agents for which mortality and morbidity benefits have been established in large, randomized clinical trials (see Table 7). Drugs used in the treatment of HF are presented in Table 8, and target doses are derived from those achieved in clinical trials.

#### ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors are recommended in all patients, as they have been shown to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization, MI and death in patients with HFrEF.​[^[14]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]] Despite the success of the ARNI valsartan/sacubitril versus enalapril in a large trial, ACE inhibitors are still an initial option for many patients who would not fit the trial entry criteria.​[^[17]] This includes patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, those with severe HFrEF, those with new HFrEF or those who cannot tolerate the equivalent of enalapril 10 mg twice a day, which was used during the trial’s run-in period. Reimbursement and affordability also limit the uptake of valsartan/sacubitril.

Start ACE inhibitors at a low dose and titrate at 7- to 14-day intervals to the target dose, or maximum tolerated dose if the target dose cannot be reached. Treatment with target doses is more effective than low doses.​[^[25]] Measure serum creatinine, potassium and BP before initiating an ACE inhibitor or increasing the dose and 7–14 days after any increase in dosage.​[^[10]] An increase in serum creatinine of up to 30% is expected and acceptable after initiation of an ACE inhibitor.​[^[6]] If the increase in serum creatinine is greater than 30%, other causes of worsening renal function should first be excluded. In particular, reassess volume status, as an increase in serum creatinine often arises from hypovolemia due to excessive diuresis. If no other cause for the worsening renal function can be identified, reduce the dose or discontinue the ACE inhibitor. Although data are limited, if the patient’s condition improves, periodically reassess the potential of restarting ACE inhibitors or increasing the dose. Patients at greatest risk of hyperkalemia are those with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, high baseline potassium, diabetes mellitus and those receiving potassium-sparing diuretics or MRA.​[^[26]]

Angioedema remains an uncommon but potentially serious adverse event with ACE inhibitors. A meta-analysis of 26 RCTs reported ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema incidence to be 0.3%.​[^[27]] In an analysis of a multinational, randomized controlled trial, angioedema was reported more often in the first 3 months of ACE inhibitor use and more frequently in patients self-identifying as Black [OR, 2.88], history of drug rash [OR, 3.78], age >65 years [OR, 1.60] or seasonal allergies [OR, 1.79].​[^[28]] The association of angioedema with patients who are Black has been found in other trials and, although the mechanism is not established, it is thought to be due to racial differences in sensitivity to bradykinin.

#### Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with ACE inhibitor–induced cough or angioedema. Patient education and follow-up are essential because ARB-induced angioedema has been reported.​[^[21]] In patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, candesartan has reduced the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF.​[^[21]] Data suggest that valsartan has a comparable effect on mortality and morbidity to captopril in patients with HF complicating an acute MI.​[^[29]] Similar to ACE inhibitors, ARBs are associated with renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia; thus, ARBs should not be substituted for ACE inhibitors specifically for these adverse events.​[^[29]] Considerations for initiation, dosage titration and monitoring for ARBs are the same as for ACE inhibitors.

#### Angiotensin Receptor/Neprilysin Inhibitor

Currently, the only ARNI available is an equimolar mixture of the ARB valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril. The neprilysin inhibition leads to the accumulation of bradykinin, adrenomedullin and natriuretic peptides (NPs). The impact on NPs makes the measurement of BNP inappropriate in patients receiving this drug, but the clinical utility of NT-proBNP as a biomarker is not affected. It is important to note that the bioavailability of valsartan is enhanced by sacubitril; valsartan 51 mg in the combination product is approximately equivalent to valsartan 80 mg in single drug formulations.

PARADIGM-HF, a large, multicentre clinical trial that included patients with mild to moderate HF, LVEF <40%, elevated concentrations of NPs or an HF hospitalization in the past 12 months, serum potassium <5.2 mmol/L and an eGFR ≥30 mL/minute, showed that valsartan/sacubitril was superior to enalapril in reducing the primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes or HF hospitalization, both of these endpoints individually, and death from any cause, as well as improving quality of life.​[^[17]] Valsartan/sacubitril had a lower risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction than enalapril, but a higher rate of hypotension. Rates of angioedema were similar. Patients in this study needed to be on moderate dose ACEi + beta-blocker +/- an MRA as part of the study entry criteria and were also required to complete a run-in to establish tolerability of both enalapril and valsartan/sacubitril.

 Current Canadian HF guidelines recommend the use of valsartan/sacubitril in place of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite treatment, including during an HF hospitalization. They also recommend that valsartan/sacubitril initiation be considered in patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF admitted to hospital.​[^[13]] 

It is critical to wait 36 hours between the administration of an ACE inhibitor and valsartan/sacubitril (or switching back to an ACE inhibitor) to minimize the risk of angioedema. Following the switch, patients should be educated regarding the risk of hypotension, which is more common than with ACE inhibitors. Valsartan/sacubitril has been studied to a limited extent in patients with a systolic BP <100 mm Hg. Serum potassium and renal function should be monitored. Because valsartan/sacubitril can cause natriuresis, fluid status should be assessed and diuretics adjusted accordingly to avoid volume depletion. Studies have shown that valsartan/sacubitril has a diuretic-sparing effect.​[^[30]] Dose titration should be performed every 2–4 weeks.

#### Beta-Blockers

Beta-blockers improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in patients with HFrEF.​[^[15]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] They are recommended in all patients with an LVEF ≤40%.​[^[13]] Beta-blockers that have been shown to reduce mortality include bisoprolol, carvedilol and controlled release **metoprolol succinate** (not available in Canada).​[^[13]] Metoprolol **tartrate** is often used in Canada, extrapolating data from metoprolol succinate, but is generally considered second line to bisoprolol and carvediolol as the data are considered more robust with these agents. In fact, mortality and hospital admissions were significantly more frequent in patients treated with metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg BID) than with carvedilol (25 mg BID) in a large randomized trial.​[^[34]] This is somewhat controversial as the target dose of metoprolol tartrate used in this trial was lower than the target dose of controlled-release metoprolol succinate that significantly decreased mortality in a large placebo-controlled trial.​[^[31]] It is hypothesized that perhaps the results were related to inadequate beta-blockade and as a result higher heart rates. Carvedilol may have larger effects on BP secondary to its alpha effects and therefore may be preferred in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

In HF patients, initiate beta-blockers at a very low dose and slowly titrate the dose at 2- to 4-week intervals.​[^[6]] Beta-blockers should not be initiated or their doses increased while patients are acutely decompensated, as their negative inotropic effects can worsen HF acutely. Nevertheless, once the patient is clinically stable, beta-blockers should be carefully initiated with close monitoring before the end of the hospitalization in those post acute exacerbation.​[^[35]] Monitoring should include BP and heart rate before initiating a beta-blocker and before any increase in dose. Additionally, monitor for signs and symptoms of HF decompensation when initiating or increasing the dose of a beta-blocker, paying particular attention to the daily morning weight.​[^[6]] Patients should be counselled that they may temporarily feel worse when initiating and uptitrating therapy in the short term, but will benefit from long-term reductions in HF outcomes. Beta-blockers should not be stopped abruptly, unless in an emergency situation to avoid rebound tachycardia.​[^[6]] 

#### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

In patients with HFrEF, an MRA should be used to reduce mortality and morbidity in all patients.​[^[36]]​[^[37]]

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eplerenone or spironolactone) should not be used in patients with a baseline potassium >5 mmol/L or creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute.​[^[6]] Monitor vital signs, serum creatinine and potassium at 3 days and 7 days after initiating or titrating the dose of MRAs, and repeat as necessary until the potassium level and renal function are stable.​[^[6]] Monitoring should then be performed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months.​[^[6]]

Eplerenone, unlike spironolactone, does not have anti-androgen effects and therefore does not produce gynecomastia, impotence or irregular menstruation. It is therefore the agent of choice in individuals who have experienced these adverse effects.​[^[10]] Eplerenone appears to have a similar risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction as spironolactone, so should not be used as a substitute in these situations. Prospective comparative data between these agents is limited. The choice is left to the discretion of the clinician and will likely be influenced by reimbursement considerations.

#### Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality, regardless of diabetes status and should be considered in all HFrEF patient unless contraindicated (e.g., type I diabetes mellitus, allergy, history of euglycemic ketoacidosis).​[^[38]]​[^[39]] The addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor should especially be prioritized in those with underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as there are additive benefits in these populations. Prior to initiation, fluid status should be assessed and diuretic doses adjusted if euvolemic, as SGLT2 inhibitors may cause volume depletion by acting as a mild osmotic diuretic. Some patients may experience worsening renal function, which may be related to volume depletion or secondary to a change in intrarenal hemodynamics (similar to ACE inhibitor or ARB). Clinical trials have consistently shown a “dip” in eGFR in the first 4 weeks, with near resolution by 12 weeks and decline in eGFR slope over time. A drop in eGFR <15% is considered acceptable. 

#### If Current Inhibitor

Ivabradine inhibits the If current in cardiac pacemaker cells resulting in reduced heart rate. It is indicated in Canada for selected individuals with an LVEF ≤35% who present with NYHA class II–III symptoms, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate ≥77 bpm despite achieving target or maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers, or in patients with beta-blocker intolerance. Ivabradine has been shown to reduce the combined risk of CV mortality and HF hospitalizations in a large randomized trial, mainly by reducing the HF hospitalizations.​[^[20]] Ivabradine also improved symptoms and NYHA functional class. In the trial, the heart rate entry criterion was ≥70 bpm, but the reduction in the primary endpoint was seen most in those with a baseline heart rate ≥77 bpm. This heart rate of 77 bpm is used in the Health Canada–approved indications; however, clinical guidelines nonetheless recommend its use in patients with a heart rate ≥70 bpm given the limitations of this subgroup analysis.​[^[13]] Clinical judgment should be used when considering ivabradine for patients with a heart rate between 70–76 bpm. Ivabradine should not be used in those with atrial fibrillation, as it works on the SA node and will not control heart rate in the setting of atrial fibrillation.

#### Digoxin

Digoxin improves symptoms and reduces the risk of hospitalization for exacerbations of HFrEF, but does not reduce mortality in patients with persistent moderate to severe symptoms (NYHA class II–IV) while on ACE inhibitor therapy.​[^[13]]​[^[22]] Digoxin may be considered in patients with persistent symptoms despite the use of optimal medical therapy (beta-blocker; ACE inhibitor, ARB or ARNI; MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor).​[^[13]] It may also be considered for ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation that cannot be controlled by beta-blockers or in patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.​[^[13]] Individualize the dosage based on the patient’s age, weight, renal function and concomitant drugs; the usual range is 0.0625–0.25 mg daily. Lower doses may be appropriate in select patients. Given the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin, pay particular attention to identifying and preventing potential drug interactions. Check digoxin serum concentrations when renal function changes significantly, when an interacting drug is added or discontinued, when significant concomitant dehydrating illness occurs, or when digoxin toxicity is suspected. Serum concentrations may also be verified after a steady state is achieved, particularly in older patients and those with renal dysfunction.​[^[40]] Measure trough serum concentrations at least 8 hours after administration and adjust the dose to maintain the serum concentration between 0.6 and 1.2 nmol/L, which is associated with greater reductions in hospitalization and, possibly, a reduction in all-cause and HF-associated mortality.​[^[41]]​[^[42]]

#### Nitrates/Hydralazine

The combination of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine can be used in HF patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors, ARBs or an ARNI due to renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, or as add-on therapy in Black patients.​[^[6]] 

Add-on therapy using isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine was tested in a randomized controlled trial in self-identified Black patients with NYHA class III–IV HF.​[^[18]] Patients were already receiving standard therapy (ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker with or without MRA), and add-on therapy showed a reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Nitrate monotherapy is valuable in treating symptoms of angina, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea. Nitrates have not been shown to reduce mortality in the absence of hydralazine.​[^[13]]

#### Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators

Vericiguat sensitizes guanylate cyclase to endogenous nitric oxide by stabilizing nitric oxide binding to the binding site. This occurs independent of nitric oxide and is thought to improve smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation without nitrate tolerance. The multicentre, randomized placebo-controlled VICTORIA trial assessed the efficacy and safety of vericiguat (10mg daily) compared to placebo in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (LVEF < 45%) and chronic HF with recent decompensation.​[^[43]] The trial results showed a significant decrease in the primary outcome of first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death (ARR = 3; NNT = 33 over 10.8 months) when added to contemporary guideline directed medical therapy. There was more symptomatic hypotension and syncope in the vericiguat arm, but there was no statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects. Vericiguat can be considered in high risk patients hospitalized for HF.​[^[13]]

#### Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation

The GISSI-HF randomized controlled trial showed a modest reduction of cardiovascular events with low-dose **omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid** (n-3 PUFA),​[^[44]] and some guidelines suggest that low-dose n-3 PUFA (1 g/day) may be considered in patients with mild to moderate HF.​[^[6]] Doses of more than 3 g/day have been associated with excessive bleeding and may interact with warfarin and DOACs.​[^[6]] Because n-3 PUFA is a food supplement, patients should consult their pharmacist to help in the selection of a reliable n-3 PUFA brand that most closely matches the formulation studied in HF (850–882 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid as ethyl esters in an average ratio of 1:1.2). Additionally, one should consider the effect of adding another medication on top of standard HF therapy and its contributions to polypharmacy and adherence, given its modest effect on HF outcomes.

#### Calcium Channel Blockers

Amlodipine is considered safe, but does not reduce mortality or morbidity in patients with HFrEF.​[^[45]]​[^[46]] It may be useful in select patients with persistent angina despite the use of beta-blockers and nitrates or in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the use of an ACE inhibitor, MRA, beta-blocker and a diuretic. It should be noted that amlodipine causes dose-related peripheral edema, which may become problematic in those with ongoing fluid retention and overload.

It is generally advised to avoid diltiazem and verapamil in patients with HFrEF because of their negative inotropic effects including adverse outcomes,​[^[6]] and felodipine and nifedipine because of the lack of data.

#### Iron Replacement

Iron deficiency, in the presence or absence of anemia, is common in HF and has been associated with poor HF outcomes such as decreased exercise tolerance, HF hospitalizations and mortality.​[^[47]] Iron deficiency can present as deficiency in iron stores (absolute deficiency) or a functional deficiency in which iron is not available to be used by cells, such as in states of inflammation like HF. Iron is important to many cell functions including erythropoiesis and other important cell metabolic functions. Iron is especially important to oxygen utilization in cardiac cells. The suggested definition of iron deficiency in HF is serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin 100–299 ng/mL plus transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%.​[^[6]]

Guidelines recommend that all patients with HF be assessed for iron deficiency. There is currently no evidence supporting the use of IV iron in HFpEF. In those with HFrEF and iron deficiency (regardless of anemia), consideration should be given to **IV** iron **replacement** with the aim of improving exercise tolerance, quality of life and reducing HF hospitalizations.​[^[6]] There is no evidence for use of oral iron supplementation in HF and therefore oral iron should not be used to treat these patients.​[^[48]]

The use of IV iron has been shown to improve outcomes including exercise tolerance, symptoms of HF, quality of life and heart failure hospitalizations in symptomatic patients with HFrEF.​[^[49]] The majority of larger trials used ferric carboxymaltose; it is unknown if trial results apply to other formulations. Despite this, other IV preparations are commonly used in Canada for this indication and dosed as per individual product monograph recommendations for iron deficiency anemia (see Common Anemias). The Ganzoni formula is commonly recommended to assess iron deficiency and subsequent replacement (total cumulative dose):​[^[50]]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iron deficit [mg] | = | body weight [kg] × (target Hb [g/L] - actual Hb [g/L]) × 0.24 + iron stores [mg] |


The IRONMAN trial used intravenous iron (III) isomaltoside in patients with HF and an ejection fraction <45% and found a reduced risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death after adjustments due to COVID-19 events.​[^[51]] This preparation is available in Canada, but does not currently have an indication for iron deficiency in HF.

#### Antiarrhythmics

Amiodarone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in select patients with atrial fibrillation.​[^[6]] It should be emphasized that a strategy of maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with HF is not superior to ventricular rate control in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation.​[^[52]]

Amiodarone has also been shown to reduce the frequency of repetitive ICD discharges.

Avoid all other antiarrhythmic drugs.​[^[6]]​[^[53]] Antiarrhythmics are not recommended for prevention of sudden cardiac death because they do not reduce mortality. 

#### HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

Although the benefit of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) is well established, 2 trials have suggested that the benefits of statins in patients with HF may be limited, even if they have CAD.​[^[54]]​[^[55]] Nevertheless, patients included in these trials were relatively older (mean age at baseline of 69 and 73 years) and presented with a baseline LDL cholesterol of only 3.2 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L respectively. Consequently, it is reasonable to continue treating younger patients and/or patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular events (recent MI, diabetes and known vascular disease). Because these trials did not study the impact of statin discontinuation, it is reasonable to continue the use of these agents in patients who are receiving them.

#### Agents to Treat Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction

The treatment of HFpEF is evolving. Despite many clinical trials using the same agents found to be beneficial in HFrEF, the majority have been neutral or only showed benefit in subgroups.​[^[56]]​[^[57]] The definition and diagnostic criteria for HFpEF have continuously evolved and made it hard to identify and define study populations. Furthermore, it is thought that HFpEF is a heterogenous group of patients with different phenotypes and differing therapeutic targets.​[^[58]] It is also hypothesized that those with HFpEF do not have the same neurohormonal activation as HFrEF and perhaps do not respond in the same manner as patients treated with medications used in HFrEF.

Treatment of HFpEF has not been shown to reduce mortality; therefore the focus of treatment has been on control of risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation) and volume status, improving quality of life, decreasing heart rate to optimize filling time and HF hospitalizations (see Figure 3).​[^[6]] However, drug treatment strategies are progressing.

#### ACE Inhibitor/ARB

Trials have suggested that the chronic use of renin-angiotensin system modulators does not significantly reduce the risk of mortality in patients with HFpEF.​[^[59]]​[^[60]]​[^[61]] The CHARM-preserved trial showed an improvement in HF hospitalization with candesartan, but this was a secondary outcome.​[^[59]] The study included patients with an LVEF >40%.

#### Angiotensin Receptor/Neprilysin Inhibitor

The role of valsartan/sacubitril in patients with HFpEF was investigated the PARAGON trial.​[^[62]] Patients with an LVEF ≥45%, an elevated BNP and evidence of structural heart disease were included. They failed to meet their primary outcome, marginally missing significance. Post-hoc review and analysis by the FDA resulted in an indication for valsartan/sacubitril regardless of ejection fraction, as it felt the results were still clinically significant.​[^[63]] In Canada, valsartan/sacubitril was not approved for HFpEF based on the PARAGON trial. It can be considered in those with HFpEF to reduce heart failure hospitalizations, acknowledging its limited evidence. However, given its lack of indication in Canada, reimbursement issues will likely be a barrier to treatment.

#### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

The TOP-CAT trial was a single trial that investigated the use of spironolactone in HFpEF with a LVEF ≥45%.​[^[64]] This trial failed to meet its primary outcome; however it was the subject of serious concerns around trial data abnormalities. In a post-hoc analysis that removed the questionable sites, the primary outcome was significant. As such, the Canadian HF guidelines now recommend that the use of an MRA such as spironolactone should be considered in individuals with symptomatic HFpEF, serum potassium <5 mmol/L and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min, with close surveillance of potassium and creatinine.​[^[6]]

#### SGLT2 Inhibitor

There are 2 trials that have investigated the role of SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in ambulatory HFpEF patients.​[^[65]]​[^[66]] Both studies included those with an LVEF >40% and showed improvement in their primary endpoint of HF hospitalization or CV death, but the outcome was mainly driven by HF hospitalization (ARR = 3.3%; NNT = 30 ).​[^[65]]​[^[66]]​[^[67]] Currently in Canada, empagliflozin has an indication for all HF including HFpEF, and the dapagliflozin HFpEF indication is pending. The SGLT2 inhibitors are the only class of medications that have definitively shown improvement in HFpEF in randomized controlled trials.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Heart Failure and Pregnancy

Pregnancy is accompanied by important cardiovascular hemodynamic alterations, including increases in blood volume, heart rate and cardiac output, as well as a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and BP.​[^[68]] In individuals with existing HF, pregnancy may be associated with significant risk for the patient, depending on the severity of the HF and comorbid conditions.​[^[68]] This risk is further increased in the presence of other cardiovascular pathologies.​[^[6]] Because many of the pharmacologic agents used in HF are potentially teratogenic, pharmacologic treatments should be selected and optimized based on their cardiovascular benefits for the patient and risks to the fetus.​[^[6]] 

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), defined as HF with LVEF <45% in the last month of pregnancy, or within 5 months of the delivery in the absence of pre-existing cardiac disease,​[^[6]] has an incidence of 1 in 3000–4000 live births.​[^[68]]

#### Management during Pregnancy

The 2017 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines recommend that patients with pre-existing HF be evaluated and counselled by an expert in HF and pregnancy before becoming pregnant.​[^[6]] The risk of the pregnancy and of the transmission of inheritable cardiac diseases, if applicable, should be addressed.​[^[6]] 

Patients should be monitored closely during the pregnancy, at the time of delivery and in the postpartum period.​[^[6]] Should worsening of HF be suspected in a pregnant patient, cardiac testing should include an echocardiogram.​[^[6]] Refer to the 2017 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for a more complete discussion.​[^[6]]

Patients with PPCM whose LVEF does not recover should be advised against any future pregnancy because of the high risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity.​[^[6]] Inform patients who do recover about the significant risk of recurrence of LV dysfunction in subsequent pregnancies.​[^[6]]

Sodium and fluid restrictions are recommended to minimize signs and symptoms of hypervolemia. Medications should be switched during pregnancy to those with better safety data.​[^[6]] Avoid ivabradine and SGLT2 inhibitors during pregnancy because data is limited, and avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNI and MRAs because they are known teratogens.​[^[6]] Beta-blockers can be used during pregnancy.​[^[6]] Beta1 selective agents, such as metoprolol, are generally preferred to avoid increased uterine tone and decreased uterine perfusion.​[^[6]] Adverse events, such as bradycardia, hypoglycemia and reduced birth weight, have been observed following in utero exposure to beta-blockers. If use of a beta-blocker is needed in the pregnant patient, fetal growth should be monitored during pregnancy and the newborn should be monitored for 48 hours after delivery for bradycardia, hypoglycemia and respiratory depression.​[^[69]] Furosemide can be used to maintain euvolemia in the patient, but take care to minimize the risk of dehydration, which can lead to reduced placental perfusion.​[^[6]] Digoxin can also be used safely, but higher doses may be required in pregnant patients because of the increased volume of distribution.​[^[6]] Reduce the dose of digoxin after delivery. Hydralazine in combination with nitrates can also be used to manage symptoms.​[^[6]] Hydralazine is a treatment option in select patients with high BP.​[^[6]] 

In patients with HF prior to pregnancy, maintain chronic treatment (or restart ACE inhibitors) following the pregnancy and continue indefinitely.

In patients with PPCM, pharmacologic therapy should be continued and LV function and size periodically reassessed. In patients in whom ventricular function does not normalize, continue treatment indefinitely. Although no formal guidelines exist, in patients in whom the LV size and function normalize, diuretics can be stopped and beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors can be slowly discontinued over months, or even years, with close monitoring to ensure that the ventricular function does not deteriorate. 

#### Heart Failure and Breastfeeding

Beta-blockers appear safe in breastfeeding.​[^[70]] Of the beta-blockers used in HF, metoprolol has been the most extensively studied in breastfeeding and may be preferred. Limited data suggest that furosemide can be used in breastfeeding.​[^[70]] The transfer of spironolactone into breast milk appears minimal; hence, it can be used during breastfeeding.​[^[70]] Current data for enalapril, fosinopril, quinapril and ramipril indicate that the quantity of these ACE inhibitors present in the breast milk is limited and they can be safely used while breastfeeding.​[^[70]] Data regarding ARBs and ARNI are limited; therefore, ACE inhibitors are preferred. Ivabradine and SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided during breastfeeding because it is not known if they are transferred into breast milk. 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for managing Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) with LVEF ≤ 40% and symptoms. It outlines a treatment pathway and decision-making process.

### Main Sections:

1. **Initiate Standard Therapies:**
   - **ARNI or ACEi/ARB:** If using ACEi/ARB, substitute with ARNI.
   - **Beta Blocker**
   - **MRA (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist)**
   - **SGLT2 Inhibitor**

2. **Assess Clinical Factors for Additional Interventions:**
   - **Heart Rate (HR) > 70 bpm and sinus rhythm:** Consider ivabradine.
   - **Recent HF hospitalization:** Consider vericiguat.
   - **Black patients on optimal GDMT or patients unable to tolerate ARNI/ACEi/ARB:** Consider combination hydralazine-nitrates.
   - **Suboptimal rate control for AF or persistent symptoms despite optimized GDMT:** Consider digoxin.

   - **Note:** Initiate standard therapies as soon as possible and titrate every 2-4 weeks to target or maximally tolerated dose over 3-6 months.

3. **Reassess LVEF, Symptoms, Clinical Risk:**
   - **NYHA III/IV, Advanced HF or High-Risk Markers:**
     - Consider referral for advanced HF therapy (mechanical circulatory support/transplant).
     - Referral for supportive/palliative care.
   - **LVEF ≤ 35% and NYHA I-IV (ambulatory):**
     - Refer to CCS CRT/ICD recommendations.
   - **LVEF > 35%, NYHA I, and Low Risk:**
     - Continue present management, reassess as needed.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Treat Comorbidities:** Follow CCS HF recommendations (e.g., AF, functional MR, iron deficiency, CKD, DM).
- **Diuretics:** To relieve congestion (titrated to minimize effective dose to maintain euvolemia).
- **Non-Pharmacologic Therapies:** Education, self-care, exercise.
- **Advance Care Planning and Documentation of Goals of Care.**

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing HFrEF, emphasizing the initiation and adjustment of therapies based on clinical factors and reassessment of patient status.
