#### Introduction

Nausea is a symptom (not a diagnosis) that refers to the unpleasant sensation of the imminent need to vomit. Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents with contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Nausea and vomiting may be transient symptoms secondary to a self-limited condition such as viral gastroenteritis or part of more complex medical issues. The underlying cause should be determined when possible. Approaches to treatment are dependent on the associated risk factors and diagnosis, which may include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV); or metabolic, GI, vestibular or neurologic causes, such as motion sickness.​[^[1]]

This chapter addresses the management of general nausea and vomiting. The management of cancer chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting is addressed in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy. The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is addressed in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

Causes of nausea include:



Complications of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting include esophageal rupture, Mallory-Weiss tears, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, malnutrition, and dental caries.

#### Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is complicated by the involvement of numerous neurotransmitters and nerve systems arising from different organs and activated by a variety of stimuli (see Figure 1).​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Because of this, it is often difficult to determine which stimulus is most responsible for a patient’s symptoms and to design a therapeutic plan.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart illustrating the pathways and mechanisms involved in nausea and vomiting, focusing on the emetic center in the medulla oblongata. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Vestibular Apparatus:**
   - Neurotransmitters involved: Acetylcholine and Histamine.
   - Medications: Scopolamine, Diphenhydramine, Dimenhydrinate, Hydroxyzine, Promethazine.
   - These influence the emetic center.

2. **Cerebral Cortex:**
   - Involves an unknown neurotransmitter.
   - Directly affects the emetic center, leading to nausea and vomiting via effector organs.

3. **Emetic Centre (Medulla Oblongata):**
   - Central hub for processing signals leading to nausea and vomiting.
   - Receives input from various sources and neurotransmitters.

4. **Neurotransmitters:**
   - Dopamine, Serotonin, Histamine, Acetylcholine, Vasopressin, Substance P.
   - Medications: Domperidone, Haloperidol, Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, Ondansetron.

5. **Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (Area Postrema):**
   - Potential stimuli include opioids, chemotherapy, levodopa, digoxin, nicotine, bacterial toxins, radiation therapy, hypoxemia, hypercalcemia, ketoacidosis.
   - Influences the emetic center.

6. **GI Tract:**
   - Potential stimuli: Chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
   - Affects the emetic center via serotonin.

The flowchart shows how different stimuli and neurotransmitters interact with the emetic center, leading to nausea and vomiting, and how various medications can modulate these pathways.

#### Motion Sickness

Motion sickness refers to the normal physiologic response to unusual perception of motion.​[^[4]] It can be precipitated by abrupt changes in movement, such as during bumpy rides, turbulent flights and rough seas, and is also referred to as carsickness, airsickness or seasickness. The development of motion sickness depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the stimulus (frequency, intensity, direction and duration) as well as individual susceptibilities including age and gender.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Women are more prone to developing motion sickness than men. Susceptibility to motion sickness is highest between 3 and 12 years of age and gradually decreases thereafter. Children under 2 years of age are typically immune to motion sickness. Motion sickness begins with a feeling of “stomach awareness,” followed by nausea, increasing malaise, pallor and sweating. As symptoms worsen, patients may also experience increased salivation, a feeling of body warmth, dizziness, and vomiting or retching.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] The severity of symptoms varies with the intensity of the stimulus and the susceptibility of the individual.

Theories as to the cause of motion sickness centre around a mismatch between the motion one expects to occur (either through visual cues or previous experiences) and the actual motion sensed by the vestibular apparatus in the ear.​[^[4]]​[^[6]] The vertical component of the motion is believed to be most important in causing motion sickness, and the movement must be repetitive, relatively slow and prolonged.​[^[4]] This may explain why ship travel, characterized by low-frequency continuous oscillation, is such a potent cause of motion sickness, while travelling in a speedboat is not.

Neurotransmitters thought to be most responsible for motion sickness include histamine and acetylcholine. Drugs used for treatment are aimed at modulating receptors for these chemicals.

#### Drug-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Almost all drugs are capable of producing nausea and, to a lesser degree, vomiting. Some of the most commonly used and/or emetogenic nonchemotherapy drugs are listed in Table 1. A thorough discussion of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy agents is available in *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting.

The mechanisms by which some drugs cause nausea and vomiting are unknown but likely involve extensions of their pharmacologic action. Drugs that cause vomiting by acting on the area postrema include dopaminergic agonists (e.g., levodopa), nicotine, digoxin and opioid analgesics. Agents such as NSAIDs and erythromycin activate peripheral afferent pathways, most likely vagal, which then stimulate the brainstem nuclei to coordinate the act of vomiting. This chapter specifically addresses cannabis and opioid analgesics.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment





Table 2 details red flags to consider when assessing a patient with nausea and vomiting.​[^[11]] Table 3 presents signs and symptoms of dehydration.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] In adults, a dry axilla supports hypovolemia while moist mucous membranes are not consistent with hypovolemia. Assessment of skin turgor does not have proven diagnostic value for hypovolemia in adults.​[^[14]] Figure 2 depicts decreased skin turgor. Figure 3 presents an approach to patient assessment for nausea and vomiting.​[^[15]]

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dehydration (see Table 3) | Blood in vomit (red or coffee grounds appearance) | Unintended weight loss |
| Persistent vomiting | Blood in stool (red or black, tarry stool) | Altered mental status |
| Abdominal pain | Difficulty swallowing | Age >55 y |


| Children | Adults |
| --- | --- |
| Dry mouth, tongue and skin | Increased thirst |
| Few or no tears when crying | Decreased urination |
| Decreased urination (<4 wet diapers in 24 h) | Feeling weak, dizzy or light-headed |
| Sunken eyes | Dry mouth/tongue |
| Sunken soft spot (fontanel) in infants | Dry axilla |
| Decreased skin turgor (see Figure 2) |  |

**AI Image Description:**
The image consists of two line drawings illustrating a medical examination technique, likely related to assessing the elbow or forearm.

1. **Left Image:**
   - A hand is shown palpating or applying pressure to the elbow area of another arm.
   - The fingers are positioned to press on a specific point, possibly to assess for tenderness or a reflex.
   - The arm being examined is bent at the elbow and supported by the other hand.

2. **Right Image:**
   - The arm is shown in a relaxed position, with the elbow slightly bent.
   - The hand is resting on the forearm, indicating a neutral or resting state.
   - This position might be used to compare with the palpation technique shown in the left image.

Overall, the images depict a sequence of a physical examination technique, possibly for assessing joint function or pain in the elbow region.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



To prevent motion sickness, counsel patients to:​[^[16]]



Acupressure wristbands (Sea-Bands) have not been shown to be beneficial for preventing motion sickness. In a controlled study of experimental motion sickness, neither acupressure nor acustimulation were of benefit;​[^[17]] however, a systematic review found no difference between antiemetic drugs and stimulation of the PC6 acupoint on the wrist in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.​[^[18]]

Aromatherapy with inhaled isopropyl alcohol pads (held 1–2 cm below the nostrils) has been shown to be more effective than placebo​[^[19]] or ondansetron​[^[20]] in reducing nausea symptoms within 30 minutes postintervention in adults in the emergency department.

Maintaining fluid intake helps prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. The amount of fluid required depends on the amount lost through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Adults require 1–3 L of total water intake to maintain normal hydration status.​[^[12]] In patients who are vomiting several times daily, additional fluid intake may be needed. For mild dehydration, drinking adequate amounts of water may be all that is required. To treat moderate to severe dehydration, it is necessary to replace electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium). Oral rehydration solutions with appropriate amounts of electrolytes are recommended under these circumstances.​[^[13]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Selected agents used in the management of nausea and vomiting are described in Table 5.​[^[21]]​[^[22]] For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

When selecting a drug, consider whether the nausea is acute or chronic, review concurrent medications, and attempt to identify the underlying cause of nausea (see Figure 3). A preventive approach may be appropriate in certain situations, for example, in the management of motion sickness. Many patients cannot tolerate oral medications when nauseated, and alternative routes of administration (IM, IV, SC, rectal or transdermal) may be more suitable.

For treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with viral gastroenteritis, there is no evidence that one antiemetic is superior to another. The initial choice should be made on the basis of previous response, available routes of administration, cost, adverse effects and patient preference. These criteria often result in diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate being tried first. Dimenhydrinate consists of 2 drugs (diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline) and must be metabolized to its active ingredient, diphenhydramine, resulting in a slower onset of action.​[^[23]]

If symptoms are worsened by movement, it may be surmised that acetylcholine is a significant contributor, and anticholinergic agents such as first generation antihistamines, e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate or hydroxyzine, may be tried first. If symptoms are associated with a feeling of fullness in the stomach, a prokinetic agent such as metoclopramide or domperidone may be a logical starting point. Caution is warranted with these agents since domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death​[^[24]] and metoclopramide is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (even in children) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw). If patients fail to respond to these initial measures, base selection of other antiemetics on adverse effects, available routes of administration, patient preference and cost. Consider trying agents with different mechanisms of action if combinations of antiemetics are to be used.

#### Motion Sickness

Since acetylcholine and histamine are thought to be the most important neurotransmitters causing motion sickness, it follows that anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs are fairly effective in controlling it. Prevention is more effective than treatment in established nausea and vomiting.



#### Opioid-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Therapeutic options for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting include the following:



#### Monitoring of Therapy

Monitoring of therapy involves paying close attention to the patient’s description of the nausea response and to changes in frequency of vomiting, and vigilantly monitoring for emergence of serious complications such as weight loss, dehydration, change in mental status (which may signal electrolyte disturbances) and blood loss from any source. Assess adherence to nonpharmacologic measures when response to therapy is suboptimal (see Table 4).

Table 5 shows the most common adverse effects encountered with the antiemetic agents discussed. If a patient experiences an intolerable adverse effect, consider reducing the dosage, switching to another agent or relying on nondrug measures alone.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion sickness | Patient: whenever exposed to stimulusHealth-care practitioner: after next visit | Minimal/no nausea.No vomiting. | Depending on the drug being used, increase dosage or switch to another agent; ensure dose given approximately 60 min before stimulus. |
| Opioid-induced nausea and vomiting | Patient: continuouslyHealth-care practitioner: daily or as often as is practical | Minimal/no nausea.No vomiting. | If dimenhydrinate ineffective, try alternative agents and/or adjust opioid dosage. |
| Symptoms of dehydration (see Table 3) | Patient: continuouslyHealth-care practitioner: daily or as often as is practical | No symptoms of dehydration. | If symptoms of dehydration occur, immediately evaluate further. |
