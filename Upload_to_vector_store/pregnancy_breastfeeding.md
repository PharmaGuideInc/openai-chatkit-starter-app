| InfluenzaSee also Influenza. | See Comments |  | See Comments |  | Treat symptoms and hydration as necessary; see individual symptoms. |
| Insect Bites and StingsSee also Insect Bites and Stings. | Treatment with ice may be sufficient | diphenhydramine (oral or topical), Nonprescription topical corticosteroids | Treatment with ice may be sufficient | diphenhydramine (oral or topical), Nonprescription topical corticosteroids | Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment if symptoms are severe or do not resolve within 7 days.Topical diphenhydramine can cause allergic contact dermatitis. |

| Pigmentary Changes (chloasma, melasma)See also Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage. |  | hydroquinone See Comments |  | hydroquinone See Comments | Minimal human data do not suggest teratogenic risk;​[65] however, as treatment is cosmetic only, use should be avoided. Systemic absorption does occur.​[66]Sunscreen use can help to prevent or minimize pigmentary changes. |
| PinwormsSee also Pinworms. | See Comments |  | See Comments |  | Published safety data exist only for prescription agents and therefore they are preferred for this indication. However, there are no published reports of adverse outcomes in pregnancy or breastfeeding associated with pyrantel pamoate. |
