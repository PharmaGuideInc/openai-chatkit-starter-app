#### Introduction

Viral hepatitis is largely caused by infection with 1 of the 5 distinct viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV)​[^[1]] (see Table 1). Other infrequent causes of viral hepatitis include adenovirus, Coxsackie virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), parvovirus B19 and, rarely, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Most viral hepatitis infections in Canada and around the globe are attributed to hepatitis A, B or C.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

Both HBV and HCV can progress from acute infections to chronic diseases, generally defined by the presence of virus in the blood for >6 months.​[^[6]] Chronic infections are mostly asymptomatic, and patients are often unaware of the infections until the development of late-stage disease complications such as ascites and encephalopathy. Over 500 million people worldwide and >500 000 Canadians are infected chronically with HBV or HCV, making chronic viral hepatitis a major public health concern.​[^[5]]​[^[7]]

In Canada, the overall reported rate of acute HBV infection in 2017 was 0.5 per 100 000. This rate has declined from the 1990s and 2000s, likely attributable to immunization and blood screening programs as well as infection-control measures.​[^[8]] For HCV infection, the overall rate in 2017, including both acute and chronic, was 31.7/100 000. The reported cases were confirmed by antibody testing, which does not distinguish acute from chronic infection.​[^[8]]

HDV, or delta hepatitis, is a defective virus and requires HBV to survive. It can be a “co-infection” when infection occurs the same time with HBV or a “superinfection” when infection occurs after first being infected with HBV. It can be an acute, short-term infection or become a long-term chronic HBV and HDV co-infection.

Viral hepatitis is considered chronic when present for ≥6 months. HBV and HCV are the most common causes of chronic viral hepatitis and they can progress to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). HEV can lead to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals. HAV does not lead to chronic infection.

Acute viral hepatitis is a systemic viral infection that by definition has been present for <6 months (often <6 wk) and causes inflammatory necrosis of the liver. Most acute viral infections are asymptomatic but 25–30% of patients with acute HCV infection will experience symptoms. When symptoms are present, they appear to be similar for all types of viruses. Hepatitis symptoms and signs may include fever, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, constant fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, clay-coloured stools and tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings include an acute rise in serum aminotransferases (ALT>AST), atypical lymphocytosis and possible elevated immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels.

Acute infection can also cause acute liver failure, although rare; pregnant patients are at particular risk.​[^[3]]​[^[9]] Patients with indications of impaired liver synthetic function, including a prolonged INR, jaundice and encephalopathy, should be immediately referred to a liver transplantation centre since massive necrosis may occur, potentially resulting in liver failure and death.

This chapter focuses on:



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Figure 1 depicts the approach to a patient presenting with acute viral hepatitis symptoms.



#### Therapeutic Choices

Most acute viral hepatitis cases are self-limiting. Specific antiviral therapy is mostly not indicated (see Figure 1). With appropriate supportive care, the majority of patients with acute HAV or HBV infection recover completely.

Acute HCV infection is rarely diagnosed and up to 80% of patients with acute hepatitis C become chronically infected as a result. Women, younger patients and icteric (jaundiced) patients are more likely to clear the virus than other patients with acute hepatitis C. A single negative HCV RNA test result is insufficient to confirm viral clearance in a patient with acute hepatitis C; the test must be repeated at least once. When acute HCV infection is diagnosed, pharmacologic treatment usually leads to favourable outcomes. Treatment of acute HCV should be considered on a case-to-case basis taking into consideration potential loss of follow-up and risk of further transmission.​[^[10]]

In Canada, acute HEV infection is rarely diagnosed. It is a self-limited disease in most cases and is managed with supportive care.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices



#### Prevention of Viral Hepatitis

Vaccination is the best strategy for prevention of viral hepatitis. Specific vaccines are available for HAV and HBV, but not for HCV, HDV or HEV (see Table 3). HDV is a defective RNA virus that requires HBsAg for entry into and exit from hepatocytes;​[^[16]] thus, vaccination against HBV confers immunity against co-infection with HBV and HDV.

Vaccinate individuals who are at high risk of contracting hepatitis A or B (see Table 2). Immunoglobulins obtained from pooled human plasma exhibiting anti-HAV activity and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) provide immediate short-term passive immunity against HAV and HBV respectively (see Table 3).

Hepatitis A vaccine (inactivated) is the preferred agent for pre-exposure prophylaxis and has largely replaced pooled immunoglobulins for postexposure prophylaxis.​[^[18]] It is very effective (up to 10 y) and is recommended for high-risk groups. Detectable antibodies are present at 1 month in 96–100% of recipients after the first dose and in 100% after the booster dose, given 6–12 months later. Hepatitis A vaccines are well tolerated and safe, and are available as a single vaccine or in combination with hepatitis B vaccine or typhoid vaccine (see Table 3).​[^[17]]

Hepatitis B vaccine induces anti-HBs production. Antibody response in general decreases with age. Children 2–19 years of age have the highest response rate (99%). The response rate for those older than 60 years of age is 50–70%.​[^[17]] Revaccinating with a single booster dose, a complete 3-dose vaccination series or using a vaccine formulation with higher concentration of HBsAg may be needed in hyporesponders or nonresponders, e.g., elderly or those with diminished immune function, including patients on hemodialysis. HBV vaccines are well tolerated and safe. Although sustainable, anti-HBs levels may diminish 10–15 years following vaccination; long-lasting protection remains due to “immune memory.”​[^[19]] There is no need for routine booster doses of HBV vaccine in immunocompetent persons after successful vaccination.

Hepatitis B immune globulin** (HBIg)** is prepared from pooled human plasma from select donors who have a high level of anti-HBs and are seronegative for bloodborne infections. It provides immediate short-term passive immunity. HBIg is administered concurrently with the vaccine, but at a different injection site. It does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Hepatitis A Infection

Acute hepatitis A during pregnancy is uncommon. No birth defects have been reported as a result of infection. Management of hepatitis A during pregnancy or breastfeeding is mainly supportive. Advise pregnant patients of the increased risk of miscarriage or premature labour. Breastfeeding can be continued.​[^[20]]

#### Hepatitis B Infection

Hepatitis B infection during pregnancy does not exert teratogenic effects on the fetus. Treatment of pregnant patients with acute hepatitis B is mainly supportive. Hospitalization may be required if liver damage leads to coagulopathy, encephalopathy or severe debilitation.

Pregnant patients with chronic hepatitis B may experience an increased rate of miscarriage or premature labour similar to that seen in hepatitis A infections.​[^[20]]

Pregnant patients may require antiviral treatment to either halt a progressive active disease or avoid vertical transmission (mother to infant). Antiviral therapy is recommended for pregnant patients in the third trimester with serum HBV DNA >200 000 units/mL.​[^[13]] In the absence of intervention, the rate of vertical transmission may be as high as 90% if the pregnant patient is HBeAg-positive.​[^[21]] Mode of delivery (vaginal, cesarean section) does not influence the likelihood of HBV transmission​[^[21]] and most infants (>90%) become chronic carriers if infected.​[^[22]]

The risk of parent-to-child transmission is greatly reduced if the newborn is immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin** (HBIg)** and hepatitis B vaccine (the standard of care).​[^[23]]​[^[24]] The failure rate of such strategy is about 1–14% and appears to be associated with the pregnant parent having a high viral load.​[^[25]] When used to further reduce the risk of in utero and vertical transmission in pregnant patients with high viral loads, lamivudine, telbivudine (rarely used in Canada) and tenofovir are usually started at 28 weeks’ gestation and continued for 1 month postpartum.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Tenofovir has the advantage of better efficacy and higher genetic barrier to viral resistance compared with lamivudine and telbivudine, and its safety for use during pregnancy is well documented in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry.​[^[25]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]] None of these agents are specifically licensed for use during pregnancy. Entecavir is contraindicated for use in pregnancy due to its teratogenicity in animal models.

HBV infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding of infants who have received HBIg and HB vaccines within 12 hours of birth.​[^[32]] Infected mothers should continue to breastfeed as there is no additional risk of transmitting the virus. Breastfeeding should be stopped if the mother experiences cracking and bleeding of the nipples​[^[32]] but can be resumed when the nipples heal.

Breastfeeding is not contraindicated during antiviral therapy. Minimal amounts of the antiviral agents are transferred into breast milk and the risk of significant toxicity to the infant is considered to be low with evidence supporting safe use during breastfeeding. However, long-term safety data in breastfeeding infants is lacking.​[^[13]]

#### Hepatitis C Infection

Treatment of pregnant patients infected with HCV is mainly supportive, and antiviral therapy is usually delayed until the postpartum period. Infected patients of childbearing age who are planning pregnancy should consider antiviral treatment before becoming pregnant.

Vertical transmission of HCV occurs in about 5% of cases but higher rates are seen if the patient is co-infected with HIV.​[^[33]] There is no effective way of reducing the risk of vertical transmission of HCV, and the mode of delivery (vaginal, caesarean section) does not modify the risk of transmission.​[^[21]] Routine testing of pregnant patients for HCV is not recommended nor cost effective.​[^[34]]

The available evidence suggests that breastfeeding does not transmit HCV; however, to be cautious, an infected patient should avoid breastfeeding if the nipples are cracked and bleeding.​[^[21]] It is not known if ribavirin is transferred into human breast milk but it has been shown to be toxic in nursing animals.​[^[21]] At present, ribavirin is not recommended during breastfeeding because the benefits to the patient do not outweigh the potential harms to the infant.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for diagnosing and managing viral hepatitis. It outlines the steps for evaluating a patient with a viral-like illness and elevated liver enzymes. Here’s a detailed description:

### Initial Assessment
- **Viral-like illness, acute rise ALT > AST**: Check INR, bilirubin, albumin.
- **Elevated INR, Bilirubin +/- encephalopathy**: Consider fulminant hepatic failure.
- **Fulminant Hepatic Failure +/- encephalopathy**: Referral to a center with liver transplantation.

### Identify Risk Factors and Check Serologies
- **Anti-HAV total, Anti-HAV IgM**:
  - If **Anti-HAV IgM positive**: Acute Hepatitis A (HA).
    - Supportive care, HA vaccine + ISG to close contacts.
    - Check ALT every 4-12 weeks until resolution.
    - Complete recovery expected in less than 1 year.

- **HBsAg, Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc total**:
  - If **HBsAg negative, Anti-HBc negative**: Vaccinate if at risk.
  - If **HBsAg positive, Anti-HBc total positive**: Chronic Hepatitis B (HB).
    - Check HBV DNA, refer to specialist if needed.
  - If **HBsAg positive, Anti-HBc IgM positive**: Acute or chronic HB.
    - Consider therapy or refer to specialist.

- **Check Anti-HDV**: No further details provided in the flowchart.

- **Anti-HCV, HCV RNA**:
  - If **Anti-HCV negative, HCV RNA negative**: Monitor ALT and refer if abnormal.
  - If **Anti-HCV positive, HCV RNA negative**: Chronic Hepatitis C (HC).
    - Refer for treatment.
  - If **Anti-HCV negative, HCV RNA positive**: Acute HC.
    - Consider treatment if symptoms persist for more than 6 months.

### Additional Considerations
- If negative serologies for HAV, HBV, and HCV, check for less common viruses: CMV, EBV, HEV, HSV, Parvovirus B19, VZV.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing different types of viral hepatitis based on serological testing and clinical presentation.
