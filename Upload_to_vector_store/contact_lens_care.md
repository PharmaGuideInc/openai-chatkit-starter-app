#### Introduction

Contact lenses can correct refractive errors associated with hyperopia (farsightedness), myopia (nearsightedness), astigmatism (blurred vision at all distances related to shape of eye or cornea), presbyopia (age-related decline in focusing of near objects) and corneas with irregular shapes such as keratoconic corneas or post corneal transplant. They may also be used as a bandage for an abraded cornea. Contact lenses sit on a tear cushion and do not actually make contact with the eye as implied by their name. They can act as physical barriers between the cornea and its tear supply if poorly fit or improperly cleaned. Since tears constantly bathe the cornea and supply it with oxygen, contact lens wear may lead to progressive corneal hypoxia and edema during each wear period. Development of clinical symptoms depends on lens materials, design and fit, the duration of wear, age of the contact lens, adherence to the care regimen, and genetic predisposition.​[^[1]]

Properly fitted contact lenses offer many advantages over eyeglasses:​[^[2]]​[^[3]]



#### Types of Contact Lenses

The 2 major types of contact lenses are soft and rigid gas-permeable (RGP). Soft lenses are worn by approximately 95% of Canadian contact lens users; therefore, this chapter focuses on their maintenance and care.​[^[4]] Scleral contact lenses are a larger version of RGP lenses; they cover the entire cornea and land on the conjunctiva. Scleral lenses provide better stability, comfort and vision for irregular corneas. Scleral lenses are also used for the management of dry eye.

#### Rigid Gas-Permeable Lenses

RGP lenses, also known as hard lenses, retain the optical qualities and durability of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate, the original hard lens, now obsolete) but have increased oxygen permeability and comfort.​[^[5]] RGP lenses have a sufficiently high oxygen permeability to prevent clinically observable corneal edema with normal wear. Hence, they offer better long-term visual acuity and, in general, result in fewer complications than either PMMA or soft lenses. RGP lenses have a lifespan of up to 5 years, which usually translates to less overall costs compared to soft lenses. However, they require daily wear in order to develop lid tolerance to the thick edge of the lens, so they are not suitable for intermittent use. With RGP lenses, eyes are easily irritated by dust, wind and other foreign objects; thus their use is progressively declining and very few Canadians wear them.

#### Soft Lenses

Soft lenses, or hydrogels, are made of a flexible polymeric material, usually hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), that has a high capacity for water absorption.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Most soft lenses are silicone hydrogels (SiHy), also made of HEMA, with the addition of silicone. Silicone hydrogels are the new standard in soft contact lenses and have largely replaced traditional hydrogels.​[^[4]]​[^[8]] Silicone hydrogels have increased oxygen permeability compared with conventional hydrogels, which has enabled longer wear times and has dramatically decreased the incidence of hypoxia and corneal edema.​[^[9]] Silicone hydrogels also adsorb less protein;​[^[10]] when used with nonpreserved care solutions, they may be the safest choice,​[^[11]] although a study found no decrease in the risk of microbial keratitis compared to HEMA lenses.​[^[1]]

The main advantages of soft lenses over RGP lenses are adaptable wear schedule and increased comfort due to their flexibility (which increases with increasing water content); soft, thin edges; and hydrophilic nature. However, these lenses may lead to ocular irritation due to accumulation of various irritants such as tear film lipoproteins, ophthalmic preparations, environmental pollutants, chemical vapors, oil and dust from fingers, cosmetics, and concentrated preservatives from some contact lens solutions. Soft lens materials tend to accumulate proteins, lipids and other deposits more rapidly, which raises the risk of developing microbial keratitis compared to RGP lenses.

#### Combination RGP/Soft Lenses

In combination lenses, an RGP centre is fused to a soft hydrogel skirt to provide the superior optics of RGP with the comfort of HEMA. The combination is an option for keratoconus and other corneal dystrophies. Soft lens solutions are used with these combination lenses.

#### Wear Schedules

Lenses are worn according to various replacement schedules. See Table 1 for a brief overview of the different replacement schedules.

Adherence problems related to conventional schedules (e.g., inadequate cleaning, disinfection and rinsing; reusing old solution; poor hygiene; use of lenses for a longer time than recommended) led to the development of planned replacement programs (PRPs) and daily disposable contact lenses. In addition to frequent replacement of lenses, following a care program that includes replacing solutions and storage cases at regular intervals may decrease the risk of ocular infections. Nearly half of all Canadian contact lens users follow a monthly or biweekly planned replacement program, while 40% use daily disposable contact lenses.​[^[4]]

Extended wear is defined as continuous use of contact lenses for 24 hours or more. The lenses are usually soft. Early uncontrolled trials suggested the rate of serious complications was not excessive and many wearers adopted extended-wear schedules. However, extended wear of contact lenses was eventually linked to increased risk of microbial keratitis.​[^[12]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]] The most common factors associated with keratitis are increased lens deposits, decreased flushing of bacteria during sleep, duration of extended wear and smoking. Despite the serious risk of microbial keratitis, the prevalence of extended wear has remained constant at approximately 5% of contact lens users.​[^[15]] Other complications of extended wear schedules are comparable to those associated with general soft contact lens wear.

#### Goals of Contact Lens Care



#### Patient Assessment

Use the following questions and answers to identify potential problems and aid in appropriate and timely referral to an eye-care professional.



#### Interactions between Medications and Contact Lenses

Patients should avoid wearing contact lenses if they require therapy with ophthalmic antimicrobials, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclosporine.​[^[14]] Other ophthalmic medications (anti-allergy, anti-glaucoma) require removal of contact lenses before instillation; lenses may be reinserted after 15 minutes. Consult individual product monographs for specific instructions regarding contact lens wear. If patients prefer to use ophthalmic medications with their lenses in place, advise them to consult with an eye-care professional.

 Almost any ophthalmic product that is not specifically designed for use with contact lenses will cause temporary discomfort. This discomfort is often due to the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which is a commonly used preservative often implicated in causing such irritation. The detergent effect of BAK creates changes in cell membrane permeability and thus causes disruptions to the corneal epithelium.

Newer preservatives, considered less toxic than BAK, include sodium chlorite (Purite), sodium perborate (GenAqua), polyquaternium-1 (Polyquad), cetrimide and a combination product containing boric acid, propylene glycol, sorbitol and zinc chloride (SofZia). Some of these (Purite, GenAqua, SofZia) are advertised as disappearing; upon exposure to light or tears, they are converted into non-toxic compounds.​[^[14]] Drops with these preservatives are likely safe to use with frequently replaced contact lenses, especially daily disposables.

Numerous systemic medications can alter eye dynamics and warrant therapeutic intervention. Sedatives (including alcohol), hypnotics, antihistamines and muscle relaxants can affect the eyelid, producing incomplete blinking or a decreased rate of blinking. Antihistamines, anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants and diuretics can decrease tear volume, leading to significant discomfort. Other medications may alter tear composition, leading to increased evaporation.​[^[21]] For more information regarding interactions between contact lenses and oral and/or ophthalmic medications, see Table 2 and Table 3 .

| Drug | Effect on Lenses​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| AnticholinergicsAntihistaminesTricyclic antidepressants​[27]​[28] | Decreased tear volume (leading to irritation and deposits in the eye in soft lens wearers and corneal drying in RGP lens wearers) |
| Antihistamines​[29]​[30]HypnoticsSedatives | Decreased blink rate (blinking is required to maintain hydration in the eye in soft lens wearers and helps supply oxygen to the cornea in RGP lens wearers) |
| Isotretinoin​[31] | Itching in the eye (blepharoconjunctivitis) and decreased wear time in soft lens wearersDry eye, decreased tolerance to contact lenses |
| Muscle relaxants | Incomplete blinking |
| NitrofurantoinPhenazopyridineRifampin​[32]​[33]Sulfasalazine​[34]Tetracycline | Discoloration of soft lenses |
| Oral contraceptives​[35] | Lens intolerance due to exacerbation of dry eye |

| Ophthalmic Agent | Effect on Soft Lenses |

| Benzalkonium chloride (preservative) | Concentrates in soft lenses and causes ocular toxicity |
| Diagnostic ophthalmic dyes:Fluorescein​[38]Rose bengal | Concentrates in soft lenses and causes staining |
| Phenylephrine | Dark discoloration of lens with repeated use |


#### Prevention of Complications

Although the list of contact lens complications is long, the most common complication is dry eye, reported at an incidence of 15–55% of contact lens wearers.​[^[39]] This can be managed by changing the contact lens material, replacement schedule and/or wear time and adding contact lens lubricating solutions to the regimen.​[^[40]] Warm compresses and blink exercises can also be helpful.​[^[41]] 

Other complications include infections (both bacterial and viral), inflammation and allergic/toxic reactions. The incidence and severity of contact lens complications is generally declining due to the increased use of daily disposable contact lenses, which eliminates issues with case contamination and solution sensitivities.​[^[1]]​[^[42]]

Proper care of contact lenses is crucial in maintaining optimal eye health. Figure 1 outlines the steps required to maintain soft contact lenses.

Nonadherence with proper lens care is the greatest threat to vision, ocular health, and lens life and affects as many as 50–99% of contact lens wearers.​[^[43]] Common forms of nonadherence include inadequate cleaning or rinsing of lenses and economizing by using contaminated or expired solutions and cases. Solution contamination (e.g., topping up old contaminated solution containers rather than replacing them), inadequate lens disinfection, manipulation of the lens in the eye, overnight wear, failure to replace lenses as scheduled and poor hygiene increase the exposure of the eye to pathogens that can lead to microbial keratitis and corneal ulcers.​[^[39]]​[^[44]]

Along with contact lens hygiene education, stress the importance of keeping all forms of water away from contact lenses.​[^[39]] Lenses must be removed before showering, using a hot tub or swimming. Never rinse lenses or store them in water. Adherence to proper lens care may be improved by explaining its benefits along with consequences of nonadherence.​[^[45]] New methods of improving adherence are required, as education alone may be insufficient.​[^[46]]

#### General Principles

When contact lenses are purchased, the wearer usually receives a contact lens case and a multipurpose solution, with or without various other solutions (e.g., rinsing, wetting). Once the sample is finished, wearers should replace their solutions with the same brand if the solutions have been well tolerated. If not tolerated, the eye-care professional will recommend a different set of solutions on a trial basis. This trial-and-error scenario is repeated until the eye-care professional considers acceptable the effect of the solutions on the corneal epithelium as viewed by a biomicroscope. Unless wearers are otherwise instructed by their eye-care professional, advise them to always use solutions from a single manufacturer. Each manufacturer formulates all components of its care regimen to be compatible with each other. The effect of substituting even 1 solution from a different manufacturer is not predictable, even if it has the same active ingredients in the same concentration. In addition, all solutions that are recommended by an eye-care professional will have been found to be compatible with the wearer.

#### Multipurpose Solutions

The majority of soft contact lens wearers use multipurpose solutions, which contain a combination of the components listed in . These solutions can be used to clean, disinfect, store and rinse soft contact lenses. They are easy to use and are relatively inexpensive.

Multipurpose solutions contain disinfectants/preservatives such as polyquaternium-1(Polyquad), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), myristamidopropyl (Aldox) and polyaminopropyl biguanide (Dymed). Most multipurpose solutions contain more than 1 disinfectant/preservative to increase efficacy against the growth of microbes on lenses and biofilms in contact lens cases. Wetting agents, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyethylene glycol, improve comfort. Surfactants, such as poloxamine and poloxamer, aid in debris removal. Other components include protein cleaners, protein management agents, buffers, osmolarity agents and chelating agents. See Table 4 for more information on the components of contact lens solutions.

Contact lenses made of certain materials should not be stored in/cleaned with PHMB-based solutions.​[^[47]] Some contact lenses, depending on their material, may require multipurpose solutions with enhanced wetting agents. Patients with allergies or sensitivities to preservatives may best respond to a hydrogen peroxide solution system. These types of situations are best assessed by an eye-care professional.

#### Hydrogen Peroxide Solution Systems

Hydrogen peroxide systems are recommended as first-line contact lens care by some experts, although their use remains low compared to multipurpose solutions.​[^[48]] These systems use hydrogen peroxide 3% solution to disinfect the contact lenses. Since hydrogen peroxide is an ocular irritant, it is necessary to neutralize the solution before contact lenses are reinserted. A catalyst neutralizes hydrogen peroxide into sterile saline and oxygen, which appears as air bubbles in the container. These air bubbles rise up vigorously and can help dislodge debris from the lenses. The disinfecting and neutralizing process takes 6 hours. Older systems (two-step) required a separate neutralizing solution. Current systems (one-step) use a platinum disc at the bottom of the contact lens case as a catalyst.

Compared to multipurpose solutions, hydrogen peroxide improves cleaning efficacy and comfort and promotes compliance.​[^[49]] The disadvantage is risk of corneal irritation due to hydrogen peroxide burn if the contact lenses are not left in the solution the required amount of time for neutralization.​[^[50]] Also, the oxygen bubbles escape the case through a small hole in the top, so the case must remain upright when in use, which makes it inappropriate for travel.

Hydrogen peroxide solutions have a red tip on the bottles to remind patients not to put the solution directly into their eye or onto the contact lens before insertion.​[^[51]]

If any multipurpose solution is on the contact lens when it is put into the hydrogen peroxide solution, foaming may result and cause the case to leak and not neutralize properly.

The case must be replaced every 3 months because the platinum disc loses its efficiency to neutralize hydrogen peroxide over time.

#### RGP Lens Solutions

RGP lenses require different solutions than soft lenses. RGP lens solutions are much more viscous than soft lens solutions in order to protect the lenses from scratching, preserve the shape of the lenses during storage, and increase wettability and comfort upon insertion. There are very few solutions available for RGP lenses; hydrogen peroxide solutions may be considered, although they may not condition the lenses enough for optimal comfort. Conventional multipurpose solutions are not as effective for RGP lenses.

Scleral RGP lenses are compatible with hydrogen peroxide solutions, not viscous RGP lens solutions. Scleral RGP lenses are inserted with non-preserved saline on them; if this saline is mixed with viscous RGP lens solution, it causes lens fogging.

#### Wetting and Rewetting Solutions

Accessory solutions are instilled into the eyes and provide wetting/rewetting, lubrication and cushioning functions in various combinations.​[^[52]] Wetting/rewetting agents are artificial tears preserved with chemicals that are compatible with soft lenses. Lubrication and cushioning actions are imparted by viscosity agents—large colloidal molecules (e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium hyaluronate) that increase resistance to flow, holding the tears in the eyes and reducing the drying-out effect of solutions. 

Unit-dose or multidose wetting agents are available in preserved or unpreserved formulations.​[^[53]] Preserved saline minimizes the risk of contamination during repeated use. Unpreserved unit-dose saline eliminates potential sensitivity reactions to preservatives.

#### Lens Cases

Store contact lenses in their cases, completely covered by a disinfecting or multipurpose solution. If lenses dry out, their shape (curvature) can temporarily change, rendering them useless until they can regain their original shape; in some instances, they may not be wearable even after they have regained their original shape. The contamination rate of contact lens cases is over 50%; a contaminated lens case can act as reservoir harboring microorganisms which could threaten sight.​[^[54]]

Fortunately, lens case replacement is being incorporated into PRPs. Replace the soaking solution daily. Empty the case of old solution and air-dry the case, face down, before adding new solution.​[^[55]] Replace lens cases at least every 3 months, with the purchase of a new bottle of lens solution, or if the case becomes soiled or develops biofilm along the threaded cap.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Care can be optimized when contact lens wearers are made aware of the many systemic and ophthalmic medications that can affect contact lenses by altering eye shape, affecting the blink reflex, altering tear volume and composition, concentrating in the lens, or discolouring the lens (see Table 2 and Table 3 ). Inform the wearer that drug-lens interactions are possible and can negatively affect the success of contact lens wear. Advise all wearers to maintain a current list of their medications and share it with their eye-care professional.
