#### Pathophysiology

Dizziness refers to a variety of sensations such as lightheadedness, fainting, spinning and giddiness.​[^[1]] Vertigo is one type of dizziness defined as a sensation of motion where there is none, or an exaggerated sense of motion (e.g., spinning) in response to a given bodily movement.​[^[2]] It is the cardinal symptom of vestibular disease resulting from lesions or disturbances in the inner ear, eighth cranial nerve or vestibular nuclei and their pathways in the brain stem and cerebellum. Vertigo is usually accompanied by varying degrees of nausea and vomiting as well as sometimes pallor, perspiration and ataxia. It may be acute, chronic or recurrent. Specific conditions that produce vertigo are listed in Table 1. Ototoxic drugs may also produce vertigo (see Assessment of Patients with Hearing Loss, Ear Pain and Ear Drainage, Table 2).

Dizziness has a number of causes unrelated to ear conditions, including cardiovascular conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, hypertension), metabolic or endocrine conditions (e.g., anemia, diabetes), psychiatric conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder) and neurologic conditions (e.g., migraine, head injury).​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Drug-induced causes of dizziness are listed in Table 2. 

| Type | Description | Treatment​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) | Most common type of vertigo (20–42% of all cases).​[5]​[6]Probable causes (e.g., surgery, infection, vasculitis, trauma, viral neuritis [see Vestibular neuritis]) identified in approximately 50% of cases.​[7]Presence of debris or small crystals of calcium carbonate (canaliths) in semicircular canals.​[5]Recurrent bouts of vertigo (brief) resulting from changes in head position,​[7] e.g., rolling over in bed.Hearing loss and tinnitus not usually present.Spontaneous resolution within 1 month in 20% of cases; 50% by 3 months. However, symptoms may recur; in such instances, referral may be necessary. | Physical manipulation of the head (e.g., Epley maneuver)​[6]​[8]​[9]​[10] much more useful than drug therapy.​[5] Epley maneuver is a specific sequence of head position changes, performed by an appropriately trained health-care provider, that moves particles into the posterior semicircular canal toward the utricle.​[8]The Epley maneuver has been found to be more effective than several other repositioning maneuvres.​[11] Routine use of antihistamines and benzodiazepines not recommended. Vestibular suppressants (see Table 3) may be used for short-term management of severe nausea and vomiting.​[5]​[6]Vestibular rehabilitation (physical therapy program to improve balance, eye-hand coordination and habituate the patient to feelings of dizziness) may be offered as initial or adjunctive therapy.​[6] |
| Meniere disease | Second most common cause of vertigo of otologic origin.​[5]Associated with distention of the endolymphatic compartment of the inner ear.Fluctuating hearing, roaring tinnitus, aural fullness and vertigo.​[7]Vertigo has acute onset and persists from 30 min to several hours. | Vestibular suppressants (see Table 3) with or without antiemetics to treat acute attacks.​[5]Prophylaxis:Dietary salt restriction (1–2 g/day), avoidance of caffeine and of nicotine is often recommended;​[5] however, there are no studies to support or refute this recommendation.​[12]Diuretics, e.g., hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (avoid loop diuretics) are often recommended but have little evidence for benefit.​[13]Betahistine is commonly used but has been shown to be no more effective than placebo.​[14]​[15]Avoid vestibular suppressants for prophylaxis, as they may impair vestibular compensation.​[b]​[5]Conflicting results have been reported for positive pressure therapy (Meniett device);​[16]​[17] minor surgery is required to place ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane.Intratympanic corticosteroids are considered second line.​[18] Intratympanic injection of gentamicin is also effective but carries the risk of hearing loss.​[18] |
| Vestibular neuritis | Self-limiting, preceded by a nonspecific viral infection.​[5]​[7]Due to inflammation (usually from a viral infection) of the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve.​[5]Sudden onset vertigo, nausea, ataxia and nystagmus.​[5]​[7]Generally no hearing impairment; referred to as labyrinthitis if hearing impairment present.​[5]Symptoms constant for 2–3 days.​[5]BPPV may occur in up to 15% of patients with vestibular neuritis. | Reassurance and explanation; prognosis is excellent.Avoid movement, as this exacerbates symptoms, and use vestibular suppressants and antiemetics for 2–3 days, after which time symptoms will have usually significantly decreased.​[5]Use as few medications as possible and encourage as much activity as tolerated so compensation is not delayed.​[5]​[7]Methylprednisolone may have a role in vestibular recovery;​[19] however, the use of steroids remains controversial and there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation for routine use.​[20] |
| Central vertigo | Less than 5% of cases.​[5]Often caused by vascular disorders, e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack, migraine.​[5] | Treat underlying cause.​[5] |

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Always seek potential drug-induced causes of vertigo and dizziness. Medication was reported to be the cause of vertigo/dizziness in 0.8% of patients <45 years of age and in 2.5% of patients >45 years of age.​[^[23]] In a Dutch study of patients ≥65 years of age presenting to a primary care practice with dizziness, 23% of patients were determined to have dizziness secondary to an adverse drug reaction.​[^[24]] All patients with vertigo should be assessed by an appropriate health-care provider. If the vertigo is accompanied by numbness, tingling or weakness in any part of the body, visual disturbances, or confusion or difficulty speaking, this is considered a medical emergency; call 911 as the patient may be experiencing a transient ischemic attack or stroke.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy depends on the cause of the vertigo; see Table 1.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics.

Table 3 describes drugs used to treat vertigo. Drug therapy for vertigo is symptomatic; in the majority of cases, the mechanism of the vertigo is unknown, and specific therapy can therefore not be determined. Unless a specific cause of vertigo is known (e.g., Meniere disease), the choice of pharmacologic agent for treatment depends on the adverse effect profile of the drug, presence of contraindications and cost. Most drugs used in vertigo act by down-regulating vestibular excitability, e.g., vestibular suppressants.​[^[5]] Many drugs have been used for vertigo, including benzodiazepines​[^[5]] and flunarizine;​[^[5]]​[^[14]]​[^[25]] however, few drugs have been properly evaluated for the treatment of vertigo. Benzodiazepines in particular have significant disadvantages and little evidence of benefit; they should be avoided unless use is warranted by comorbidities such as anxiety.

Betahistine was studied in patients with Meniere disease. No difference was found between placebo and either dose of betahistine (48 mg daily or 144 mg daily) in terms of frequency or severity of symptoms.​[^[15]] This confirms the findings of a previous Cochrane review that questioned the usefulness of betahistine in patients with Meniere disease.​[^[14]] A more recent Cochrane review of patients with vertigo from various causes showed that patients treated with betahistine had a decrease in vertigo symptoms compared with placebo; however, there was significant variability in the results and the quality of the trials was poor.​[^[26]]

Although vestibular suppressants (anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers) may reduce vertigo, they also reduce vestibular function in the normal ear, which is a disadvantage. Vestibular suppressants reduce or slow down vestibular compensation and prevent the CNS from receiving the necessary feedback to facilitate compensation.​[^[5]] For this reason, vestibular suppressants are not intended for long-term use. In most cases, the duration of treatment should be a week or less.

For older patients in particular, reassessment of effectiveness of medications that may cause dizziness or reduce CNS feedback is important. When conducting medication assessments, consider the ongoing need for medications that can affect balance, and recommend deprescribing as appropriate.​[^[27]]​[^[28]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Vertigo is often self-limiting. Evaluate the need for continued use of daily medication, at least initially. Determine the severity, duration and frequency of the vertigo. Monitor patients for relief of vertigo and associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and anxiety. If no improvement of vertigo is noted, discontinue drug therapy. Monitor patients for adverse effects such as drowsiness and anticholinergic effects.

#### Advice for the Patient

Advise patients who receive drug therapy regarding:
