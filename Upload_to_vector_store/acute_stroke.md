#### Introduction

Stroke, recognized clinically as the sudden onset of a focal disturbance of central nervous system function, is caused by cerebral infarction (ischemic stroke, responsible for about 85% of all strokes) or intracerebral hemorrhage.​[^[1]] Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common type of hemorrhage, more often causes sudden onset of severe headache with or without impaired consciousness and/or focal findings on neurological examination. 

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those caused by an ischemic stroke, and not resulting in lasting deficits. TIAs are clinically very important, as they can indicate the risk of future stroke in up to one-third of people. TIAs should be viewed as an opportunity to prevent future strokes and must be treated as an emergency.

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada promotes awareness of the warning signs of possible stroke (see Table 1) to encourage prompt response when needed.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

The evaluation of patients with suspected stroke is highly time-dependent. Specific stroke treatments (recanalization with thrombolytic drugs and/or endovascular thrombectomy) can be provided only within the first hours of symptom onset in most patients with ischemic strokes (see Figure 1, Figure 2).

Use the clinical history, physical examination, imaging studies and other ancillary investigations to help confirm the diagnosis and exclude stroke mimics such as subdural hematoma, Todd paralysis (post-seizure), brain abscess, herpes simplex encephalitis, hypoglycemia, brain tumor (primary or secondary), multiple sclerosis, migraine and conversion disorder.​[^[2]]



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke

Patients who have had major anterior circulation ischemic strokes with specific features (see Table 2) stand to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).​[^[4]] EVT is a nonsurgical, angiographic procedure that uses microcatheters to remove blood clots and re-establish arterial blood flow in the brain. Figure 1 and Table 2 suggest a strategy to balance the potential benefit of EVT against persisting uncertainties and resource considerations. The time window for intervention is evolving, as we understand more about tissue-window in stroke care. Studies have shown that select patients identified using specialized imaging modalities (including automated calculation of infarct core as well as viable brain tissue represented by the ischemic penumbra) can benefit from EVT up to 24 hours after stroke onset.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Patients with stroke caused by basilar artery occlusion have been less well studied, but should also be considered for EVT.​[^[8]]​[^[9]] 

EVT is best achieved by a clinician experienced in the procedure using a stent retriever and/or contact aspiration device.​[^[10]] EVT may be performed after initiating treatment with intravenous alteplase (rtPA) or in patients who would be excluded from alteplase use (see Table 3).

#### Ischemic Stroke

#### Thrombolytics

Administer IV alteplase (rt-PA) as soon as possible following stroke onset in patients who meet eligibility criteria (see Figure 1, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5).​[^[2]] A meta-analysis of individual patient data from 9 randomized trials involving 6756 participants selected on the basis of their clinical presentation and the findings on a noncontrast CT brain scan showed that thrombolysis within 3 hours significantly increased the chance (from 231–329 per 1000 patients treated) of being alive and independent 3–6 months after ischemic stroke.​[^[20]] Thrombolysis between 3 and 4.5 hours provided a smaller yet still significant benefit (chance of independent survival increased from 301 to 353 per 1000 patients treated). This overall benefit was found despite an increase in early intracranial hemorrhage (5.4% increase compared to the control in the NINDS trial).​[^[21]] Select patients who cannot have EVT may benefit from alteplase within 9 hours of stroke onset. The WAKE UP and EXTEND trials showed alteplase was beneficial in carefully selected patients even when administered after >4.5 hours.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]

Tenecteplase (TNK) is being investigated as an alternative thrombolytic agent to alteplase in stroke treatment. It has greater fibrin specificity, longer half-life, and is administered as a single bolus rather than a one-hour infusion. TNK at 0.25mg/kg (as a single bolus, maximum of 25 mg) has been shown to be non-inferior to alteplase in efficacy and safety; in the ACT trial, similar proportion of patients achieved excellent outcome (36.9% in the TNK group and 34.8% in the alteplase group) without an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (3.4% in the TNK group and 3.2% in the alteplase group).​[^[24]]​[^[25]] It is not yet approved by Health Canada for this indication.

#### Anticoagulant Therapy



For information on postacute antithrombotic treatment, carotid endarterectomy and risk factor modification, see Prevention of Ischemic Stroke.

#### Preventing Venous Thromboembolism​[2]

There is evidence for both intermittent pneumatic stockings (IPS) or chemoprophylaxis for DVT/PE prevention in acute stroke patients, but there is no data to support the superiority of either approach. In the absence of contraindications, use of low molecular weight heparin **(LMWH)** or unfractionated  heparin **(UH)** in prophylactic doses (see Venous Thromboembolism) can be considered in patients with acute ischemic stroke who cannot move one or both lower limbs or mobilize independently.​[^[43]] Prophylaxis should be stopped once an anticoagulant is prescribed.

#### Blood Glucose Management

Hypoglycemia should be corrected immediately. Hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcome after stroke. It is a risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy and should be treated.​[^[2]] Using an SC insulin regimen is recommended since aggressive management of blood glucose using IV insulin did not improve outcomes and was associated with more hypoglycemia.​[^[44]]

#### Blood Pressure–Lowering Treatment



#### Hemorrhagic Stroke

#### Intracerebral Hemorrhage​[48]

The mainstay of intracerebral hemorrhage treatments are blood pressure control and anticoagulant reversal, but the effect size of these interventions is small.​[^[48]] 

Treat patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage and an established coagulopathy or a history of warfarin use with **prothrombin complex concentrate**, vitamin K or fresh-frozen plasma to reverse the coagulopathy. Idarucizumab reverses the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.​[^[49]] Andexanet alfa is a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) that is not widely available in Canada.​[^[50]] If there is a persisting strong indication for anticoagulation (e.g., mechanical heart valve), decide when to restart anticoagulant therapy on a case-by-case basis. Administration of **recombinant factor VIIa** prevents hematoma growth, but is not recommended for routine use because it increases the risk of arterial thromboembolic phenomena and does not reduce death or disability.​[^[51]] Its use in hyperacute ICH (<2 h from onset) is an area of ongoing research. 

Intensive BP lowering with IV agents to <140 mm Hg systolic (compared with <180 mm Hg target) in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage is safe but is not associated with clearly improved functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.​​[^[52]]​[^[53]] INTERACT2 showed significantly improved functional outcome using the ordinal shift analysis. A meta-analysis inclusive of these trials showed lowering BP reduced hematoma expansion but did not improve odds of better recovery.​[^[54]] In practice, lowering systolic BP to less than 140–160 mm Hg may be reasonable, particularly in patients who present within the first 6 hours with severe hypertension, have imaging markers of hematoma expansion (e.g., spot sign) and have normal renal function. 

After the acute phase, manage patients with intracerebral hemorrhage similarly to those with ischemic stroke, except avoid anticoagulants. 

In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, the use of LMWH or UH for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is controversial. Intermittent pneumatic stockings should be applied within 24 h, but chemoprophylaxis can be considered 48 h after hematoma stabilization.

Resumption of long-term antithrombotic therapy in this population is an area of ongoing research. RESTART showed treatment with a single antiplatelet agent in ICH patients who have an indication (e.g., coronary artery disease) is safe and does not increase the risk of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage.​[^[55]] The safety of anticoagulation in patients with ICH and atrial fibrillation was indeterminant in SOSTART.​[^[56]] This question is being examined further in several randomized trials.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is not an indication for statin therapy. The indication for statin use should be reviewed if a patient is using a statin; in a trial that included patients with hemorrhagic as well as ischemic stroke, statins use was correlated with a higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage.​[^[57]] 

#### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

Treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage is primarily nonpharmacologic (ablation of the bleeding source). Refer patients with suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage to a neurosurgical centre immediately.

Nimodipine 60 mg PO Q4H for 3 weeks reduces the risk of secondary vasospasm and cerebral infarction. Consider a dose of 30 mg PO Q2H in patients who are very sensitive to the BP lowering effects (see Table 6).​[^[58]]

#### Choices During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Acute Stroke and Pregnancy

Acute stroke management during pregnancy is the topic of a best practice consensus statement.​[^[59]] A Canadian study reported a stroke frequency of 13.4 per 100 000 deliveries, which is at least double than that seen in the general population of young adults.​[^[60]] Stroke during pregnancy is more likely to be hemorrhagic (about 59% of cases) than ischemic and most often occurs close to the time of delivery and in the postpartum period (about 52% of cases).​[^[61]]

Risk factors for stroke in pregnancy are older age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome, congenital heart disease, connective tissue disorders, sepsis, severe postpartum hemorrhage, and thrombophilic disorders.​[^[61]]

Other neurovascular (“stroke overlap”) syndromes, such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, may also be associated with severe preeclampsia.

#### Management

An interdisciplinary team approach is preferred to address care and management decisions and should involve those with stroke, obstetrical and maternal-fetal medicine expertise.

Initial emergency investigations and treatment of stroke during pregnancy or within the 6 weeks after delivery are similar to the approach taken in the nonpregnant patient.

There is insufficient evidence to support the safety of antiplatelet agents other than ASA in pregnancy. There are insufficient data on the safety of direct oral anticoagulants in pregnancy. Warfarin is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided, especially between 6 and 12 weeks’ gestational age. When anticoagulation is considered, LMWH is preferred throughout pregnancy.

For intracerebral hemorrhage, the priorities are BP control and the identification and management of coagulopathies.

##### Imaging Considerations

A typical noncontrast CT scan of the pregnant patient’s head exposes the fetus to a negligible amount of radiation. There is a lack of evidence on, but no known harm from, CT contrast. MRI is not associated with fetal risk, but gadolinium enhancement should be avoided.​[^[62]]

##### Thrombolytic Therapy

Pregnant patients were excluded from the trials of alteplase therapy for acute ischemic stroke; however, case reports suggest that the hazards of therapy do not outweigh the benefits. Guidelines advise that alteplase is a reasonable treatment option.​[^[59]] 

Patient health considerations are that alteplase may increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after epidural or spinal anesthesia, and bleeding following cesarean delivery. 

Alteplase does not cross the placenta.​[^[63]] Therefore, it is not expected or known to pose any direct risk to the fetus.  

##### Endovascular Thrombectomy

A pregnant patient with a large vessel occlusion should be offered EVT. Depending on the clinical scenario, it may be reasonable to forgo rt-PA.​ 

#### Acute Stroke and Breastfeeding

Initial emergency investigations and treatment of stroke within the 6 weeks after delivery are similar to the approach taken in the nonpregnant patient. Continuation of breastfeeding after exposure to CT contrast does not pose any known risk to the infant. 

Alteplase may increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, bleeding after epidural or spinal anesthesia, and bleeding following cesarean delivery. It is likely destroyed in the infant’s GI tract. There is probably no hazard to the infant of a breastfeeding patient treated with the drug, though no information is available on the clinical use of alteplase during breastfeeding.​[^[63]]

Low-dose ASA can be considered during breastfeeding since there is evidence that it is not transferred into breast milk, and salicylate levels are low in patients taking daily low-dose ASA.  

If anticoagulation is required, **LMWH** and warfarin are both considered safe options during breastfeeding. The safety of DOACs in breastfeeding have not been established.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart designed to guide the management of hemorrhages based on their location. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - The flowchart begins with the question: "Where is the hemorrhage?"

2. **First Decision Branch:**
   - The hemorrhage can be classified into two main categories:
     - **Extra-axial**
     - **Intra-axial/Intracerebral**

3. **Extra-axial Pathway:**
   - If the hemorrhage is extra-axial, it can be further classified into:
     - **Subarachnoid**
     - **Epidural**
     - **Subdural**
   - For all extra-axial hemorrhages, the next step is to "Contact neurosurgery."

4. **Intra-axial/Intracerebral Pathway:**
   - If the hemorrhage is intra-axial/intracerebral, it can be located in:
     - **Cerebellum**
     - **Supratentorial hemisphere**
     - **Brainstem**

5. **Cerebellum Pathway:**
   - If the hemorrhage is in the cerebellum, the next step is to "Contact neurosurgery."

6. **Supratentorial Hemisphere Pathway:**
   - If the hemorrhage is in the supratentorial hemisphere, assess if the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is superficial and associated with reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ± herniation.
   - If **Yes**, the next step is to "Contact neurosurgery."
   - If **No**, proceed to "Follow general inpatient management algorithm (see Figure 4)."

7. **Brainstem Pathway:**
   - If the hemorrhage is in the brainstem, proceed to "Follow general inpatient management algorithm (see Figure 4)."

This flowchart provides a structured approach to determining the appropriate management steps based on the location and characteristics of the hemorrhage.
