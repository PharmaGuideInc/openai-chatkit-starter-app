#### Pathophysiology

Warts are common viral infections of the skin and mucus membranes caused by any of 150 or more distinct DNA viruses in the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. Since warts resemble small hills on the skin, they are named “verruca,” which means “a steep place.” Children and young adults are most commonly affected. Handlers of meat, poultry and fish have a high incidence of warts. An estimated 12% of the population is affected at any given time, with the highest prevalence (up to 20%) in school-aged children.​[^[1]] Warts are usually spread through broken skin by direct skin-to-skin inoculation of the virus from an infected person. The degree of exposure to HPV at home and in school contributes to wart development in elementary school children.​[^[2]] Time between inoculation and the appearance of a lesion is variable, ranging from 2–9 months for common warts. Cell-mediated immune responses to the virus are important in host resistance.​[^[3]] Immunosuppressed states, organ transplants and certain genetic syndromes are predisposing factors for more extensive or recalcitrant warts.​[^[4]] Recurrence is common. Due to the effects of smoking on inflammation and immune response, the risk of recurrence of warts is 5-fold higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers.​[^[5]] Common warts, flat (plane) warts and plantar warts are self-treatable.​[^[3]] This chapter addresses common and flat (plane) warts. Plantar warts are discussed in a separate chapter: Plantar Warts. Anogenital warts are discussed in Sexually Transmitted Infections.

#### Common Warts

Common warts seem to be mostly associated with HPV types 2, 27 and 57 according to one study.​[^[6]] They appear as single or grouped hyperkeratotic papulonodules most often seen on the knees, fingers, hands and around the nails. They can occur anywhere on the skin. The lesions typically are small, hard, raised growths with a rough surface that looks like cauliflower. Spontaneous remission occurs in about two-thirds of affected patients within 2 years. See photos, Common Warts: Common Warts, Common Warts, Common Warts.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a finger, specifically focusing on the area near the nail. There is a cluster of small, rough, skin-colored growths on the skin adjacent to the nail. These growths have a bumpy texture and appear to be warts, which are typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The surrounding skin looks normal, with no visible signs of redness or inflammation. The nail itself appears healthy and intact. This presentation is consistent with common warts, often found on fingers and hands.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a skin condition on a person's elbow. The skin appears to have multiple raised, scaly, and rough patches. These patches are light-colored and vary in size, with some appearing as small, isolated spots and others forming larger clusters. The texture seems to be thickened and possibly keratotic. The surrounding skin looks normal without significant redness or inflammation. This presentation is consistent with a dermatological condition that may require further medical evaluation for diagnosis and treatment.

#### Flat (Plane) Warts

Flat warts (also called plane warts) are usually associated with HPV types 3, 10, 26–29 and 41​[^[7]] and frequently present on the face and neck as several small papules with a smooth surface that are the same colour as the surrounding skin. The skin and dorsa of hands may also be involved. They may arise after scratching or trauma and appear in a linear arrangement.​[^[3]] They are thought to be more likely to resolve spontaneously than common warts.​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

A description and differential diagnosis of warts can be found in Table 1. Common and flat (plane) warts may cause pain and may bleed if irritated; otherwise, they produce no symptoms and are harmless.

| Condition | Distribution | Lesion | Differential Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common warts | Hands, surrounding or beneath the nails, sites of trauma | Skin-coloured or grey-brown dome-shaped papule, studded with black dots occurring singly or in groups | Callus: has skin lines. Corn: appears as tough layers of yellow, compacted dead skin cells with a painful central cone that is triangular in shape and pointing inward.Seborrheic keratosis: greasy, pigmented (dirty yellow to black colour) appearance, affects middle-aged and elderly persons.Molluscum contagiosum: small, skin-coloured, firm, domed papule with a central pore indentation. A cheesy white material can be expressed. It affects primarily children and sexually active young adults.Comedone (whitehead): contents can be expressed. Occurs in the presence of other acne lesions, e.g., pustules (pimples).Skin tag: skin-coloured papule that lacks the roughness of a wart.Squamous cell carcinoma: asymptomatic skin-coloured to reddish-brown firm tumor on damaged skin. Usually there is a central ulceration. It occurs in sun-exposed areas and appears later in life. |
| Flat warts (plane warts) | Face, backs of hands, shins | Skin-coloured or light brown smooth, flat or slightly elevated papules occurring in multiples | Epidermal nevi (linear birth marks present since birth).Lichen planus: lesions resemble flat (plane) warts but may be symmetrical and accompanied by lacy oral lesions. |


Patients presenting with warts on the face or genitals and those with recalcitrant or widespread lesions require assessment by an appropriate health-care practitioner. Patients with conditions associated with neuropathies, such as diabetes or circulatory disorders, should not self-medicate with caustic substances because they are unable to judge the effects of the therapy and are more likely to have poor healing.​[^[9]] 

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Topical therapy is used to remove the virus-containing wart with minimal destruction of normal tissue. The type of therapy depends on the location, degree of symptoms, and the patient’s immune status and level of cooperation. Scarring can occur with more destructive therapies. Therapy may take several weeks or months.

Evidence supports the use of salicylic acid or cryotherapy for the local treatment of common and flat (plane) warts.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Recalcitrant warts (those not responding to 3 months of therapy with salicylic acid or cryotherapy) often require cryotherapy every 10–14 days combined with salicylic acid or curettage and electrodessication (drying out via electric current).​[^[4]] Up to one-third of nongenital warts become recalcitrant.​[^[24]]

Delaying treatment of common or flat (plane) warts until after pregnancy or breastfeeding is often feasible. If treatment is required, salicylic acid or cryotherapy are generally considered first-line treatments.​[^[25]]​[^[26]] Information about safety of these and other medications used to treat warts during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 3.

Darkly pigmented skin is more prone to develop post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloids (abnormal proliferation of scar tissue) due to treatment-induced skin trauma than lightly pigmented skin, necessitating a cautious approach, especially with more irritating or destructive treatments.​[^[27]]

A summary of treatment recommendations for common and flat (plane) warts can be found in Table 2.

#### Salicylic Acid

Common and flat (plane) warts can be self-treated topically with salicylic acid, which has produced a cure rate of 52% versus 23% with placebo.​[^[23]] Salicylic acid is an effective keratolytic that causes a slow destruction of the virus-infected epidermis. In addition, an immune response is stimulated by the resulting mild irritation of the epidermis.​[^[4]] Salicylic acid is commercially available in a variety of strengths and dosage forms that may be combined with lactic acid. Strengths of about 17% in liquid (collodion) form are useful for common warts and multiple warts, whereas strengths of 20–40% as plasters are preferred for thicker skin areas such as the plantar surface (see Table 5).​[^[1]] Salicylic acid is suitable for use on any cutaneous site except the face. Instructions for use can be found in Warts—What You Need to Know.

#### Cryotherapy

Cryotherapy with application of freezing temperatures to −196°C causes cell necrosis and may induce local inflammation where an effective cell-mediated response clears the virus. Dermatologist or family physician-administered cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen every 2 weeks can produce a cure rate of 49% after 13 weeks, according to one study.​[^[29]] Melamine foam sponge applicators rather than cotton swab applicators may be the optimal method of application of liquid nitrogen, as they appear to be more efficacious with less treatment sessions and fewer adverse effects.​[^[30]] A mixture of dimethyl-ether/propane is available for home cryotherapy but does not appear to be effective in achieving the low temperatures necessary.​[^[4]]​[^[31]] Physician-administered cryotherapy has comparable efficacy to topical salicylic acid but causes more adverse effects including pain, blistering, scarring, skin irritation, changes in skin pigmentation and crusting.​[^[17]]​[^[21]] Prominent hypopigmentation can occur in darkly pigmented skin; it is usually transient but can be permanent.​[^[27]] Caution to prevent inadvertent injury to tissue adjacent to the wart is necessary, particularly when cryotherapy is applied near cutaneous nerves, tendons, and nail apparatus or in patients with impaired circulation.​[^[4]]

The freezing cycle of liquid nitrogen application can cause painful stinging, which is usually tolerable and short-lived. Three studies looking at application of a topical anesthetic combination (lidocaine/​prilocaine) prior to cryotherapy to reduce pain associated with the procedure have shown the following varying results: no effect;​[^[32]] decreased pain only in warts on hardened skin in children;​[^[33]] and no pain reduction at the time of procedure but significant improvement over placebo at 1 hour post-treatment.​[^[34]]

#### Other Treatments

Because recommended wart management (salicylic acid, cryotherapy) is not consistently effective and is dependent on patient adherence over long treatment courses, many other treatment options have been attempted. Evidence of benefit and safety of these approaches is less rigorous than for salicylic acid and cryotherapy; they are considered second- or third-line options and as such are usually initiated by specialists. The British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for the management of cutaneous warts have divided these approaches into 4 categories based on their mechanism of action: destructive (salicylic acid and cryotherapy fall into this category), virucidal, antiproliferative and immunologic. These guidelines also provide information on the quality of available evidence and strength of recommendation.​[^[4]] Selected therapies from each category are discussed briefly below.

##### Destructive Therapy

Lasers produce a controlled thermal destruction of the warts. Unlike CO2 lasers, which cause generalized tissue destruction, pulsed dye lasers and KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate) lasers are selectively absorbed by hemoglobin in the dermal blood vessels and destroy only the wart vessel vasculature with additional thermal injury to the HPV virus. Treatment is painless (no local anesthesia required) and no burning tissue smell is produced. Unacceptable hyper or hypopigmentation changes and/or scarring can occur when used in patients with darkly pigmented skin.​[^[27]] Cure rates of up to 89% have been reported.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]

Photodynamic therapy involves applying a photosensitizer, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 20%, to the wart and leaving it on for 3–8 hours followed by exposing the lesion to visible-light irradiation. This induces photooxidation in abnormal cells. Keratolytics and paring before phototherapy are recommended. Burning, itching and occasionally severe pain may occur. Hyper or hypopigmentation post-treatment can occur in patients with darkly pigmented skin.​[^[27]] Cure rates of 56–75% have been reported.​[^[37]]

Cantharidin (0.7%) is a blistering agent produced by beetles that is used in recalcitrant cases with multiple lesions or in young children. Application in the office is painless but pain and blisters occur up to 48 hours after application. Repeated applications at intervals of 1–3 weeks are occasionally needed. Healing without scars occurs in 5–10 days. Post-inflammatory pigment alteration comparable to other destructive techniques can occur, ​[^[38]] with darkly pigmented skin being more susceptible.​[^[39]] Reported cure rates are as high as 80% in common, plantar and periungual (around a fingernail or toenail) warts.​[^[40]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Combination products containing cantharidin, podophyllotoxin and salicylic acid have also been shown to be safe and effective.​[^[42]]​[^[43]] Cantharidin is highly toxic if ingested. 

The caustic agent trichloroacetic acid has been used to treat common warts through destruction of local tissue, despite a limited evidence base.​[^[4]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] 

Hyperthermia involves application of localized heat to warts. The mechanism by which hyperthermia may treat warts is not yet clear but may include increasing the number of apoptotic keratinocytes, increasing skin blood flow via vasodilation, altering cytokines and modifying cellular immune response. Small trials using different methods have been shown to be reasonably safe and effective.​[^[4]] A single treatment using a handheld device with 2 electrodes in direct contact with a wart, which heats the lesions to 50°C for 60 seconds, was shown to produce similar clinical clearance rates as multiple treatments with cryotherapy in one study. Due to a 20% rate of scarring in this study, the authors recommend it only be used for palmoplantar warts.​[^[46]]

##### Virucidal Therapy

Glutaraldehyde 10% paint applied daily after paring for 3 months produced cure rates of 80% for periungual and 60% for palmar warts in a small study of young children.​[^[47]] Deep necrosis can occur upon repeated application or with higher concentrations.​[^[48]]

Formaldehyde 3–4% solution as a 15- to 20-minute soak daily for 8 weeks (along with paring) produced a cure rate of 80% for plantar warts in children in one study. Allergic reactions may occur.​[^[49]]

##### Antiproliferative Therapy

Bleomycin sulphate (0.1–1 units/mL) intralesional injection is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis in cells and viruses. It may be used for recalcitrant warts by injecting directly into the wart over 1–3 treatments. Local anaesthesia is necessary since this is painful during and up to 2 days after treatment. Bleomycin treatment can result in significant systemic drug exposure and should not be used in children, pregnant patients, immunosuppressed patients or those with vascular disease. Cure rates range from 65–85%.​[^[50]]​[^[51]]

Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution is the active ingredient of podophyllin, an antimitotic agent. This solution can be applied at home once or twice daily 3–4 days per week for up to 4–6 weeks. Pain, burning, erosions, pruritis and bleeding may occur, possibly leading to pigmentation concerns after healing, particularly in darkly pigmented skin. If applied to large areas (>10 cm​[^2]) or in high concentrations, systemic absorption may result in neurotoxic effects, limiting use. It has been a standard treatment for anogenital warts, with limited trial data in cutaneous warts. Cure rates using 25% podophyllin in paraffin for plantar warts were 67%. It has been considered contraindicated in pregnancy;​[^[52]]​[^[53]] however, a large cohort study did not show any association with adverse fetal outcomes.​[^[54]] Combination products containing podophyllotoxin, cantharidin and salicylic acid have also been shown to be safe and effective.​[^[42]]​[^[43]]

Tretinoin (0.025–0.1%), a topical retinoid, disrupts epidermal proliferation and differentiation to reduce wart volume. Applied once or twice daily for 6–12 weeks, it causes skin irritation and dryness that may contribute to an inflammatory reaction to produce an immunomodulatory effect on the virus. Studies suggest a cure rate of 85% in children with flat (plane) warts​[^[55]] and 29% in organ transplant recipients.​[^[56]] There is some evidence of efficacy for oral retinoids. Studies have reported cure rates of 100%​[^[57]] and 73%​[^[58]] for treatment of recalcitrant facial flat (plane) warts with isotretinoin. Another small study found oral isotretinoin produced significantly earlier and higher complete or partial clearance rates of flat (plane) warts compared with topical isotretinoin, and suggested oral isotretinoin be considered over more destructive therapies when multiple facial warts are present.​[^[59]] Etretinate produced clearance of 80% of all warts in a study in children​[^[60]] and acitretin reduced the bulk of lesions but had a high recurrence rate in another study.​[^[61]]

5-Fluorouracil 5% cream blocks RNA and DNA synthesis and damages dividing basal layer cells. It can be applied with an occlusive covering to common warts and flat (plane) warts affecting the hands and feet once daily for 4–12 weeks. It has been used as an intralesional injection in combination with lidocaine and epinephrine. Inflammation with occasional erosions and hyper- or hypopigmentation can occur, particularly in darkly pigmented skin. Local sun protection is required to prevent an exaggerated response. Cure rates of 60% have been reported.​[^[4]]​[^[62]]​[^[63]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]] 

##### Immunologic Therapy

	Contact  immunotherapy involving topical application of contact allergens including squaric acid dibutylester (SABDE), dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) has shown efficacy in recalcitrant cases. DNCB has mutagenic potential and therefore is rarely used.​[^[41]] Contact immunotherapy begins with high concentrations applied to a small area of the skin to induce sensitization. This local, delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction triggers the local immune response to the virus. Two weeks later, lower concentrations that are titrated are applied twice weekly for 10 weeks. Erythema, edema, pruritis, burning, pigment changes (particularly in darkly pigmented skin) and desquamation may occur. Treatment should be stopped if diffuse eczema or urticaria develop. Cure rates of up to 86% have been reported. Proper storage is important: DPCP should not be exposed to light and SABDE must be refrigerated.​[^[66]]​[^[67]]​[^[68]]

Intralesional  immunotherapy involves injection of an antigenic substance into the wart to evoke a host cell–mediated immune response, leading to recognition and clearance of warts. Various antigens have been used, including autoinoculation (excision, mincing and dermal implantation of patient’s own warty tissue); *Candida*; interferon; human papilloma virus (HPV); measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); purified protein derivative (PPD/tuberculin); and *Trichophyton*.​[^[4]]​[^[69]]​[^[70]]​[^[71]] Due to the general immune-stimulating effect, resolution of multiple warts may be achieved by injecting only 1 wart. Reported cure rates range from 50–100%. A network meta-analysis of available RCTs found PPD and MMR most effective in achieving complete primary and distant recovery.​[^[70]] Potential benefits of intralesional immunotherapy over cryotherapy include no scarring, resolution of warts at site distant to the treated wart, fewer treatment sessions needed and reduced recurrence rates at the treated site. This therapy is currently recommended to be undertaken only by experienced dermatologists.​[^[4]]

Imiquimod 5% cream is a topical immunomodulator that enhances cell-mediated immunity. It is a painless, nonscarring option for treatment of recalcitrant or facial lesions. The cream can be applied overnight 3 times weekly or up to twice daily, with improvement noted within weeks to months. Duration of treatment can be as long as 16 weeks. Local pain, pruritus and irritation are usually mild. Imiquimod is used in the treatment of genital warts, but efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous warts has not been established. Some small open-label studies have suggested it may be effective (estimated average cure rate of 44%). Dosing, frequency of application and how to optimally combine imiquimod with other modalities are all unanswered questions.​[^[24]]​[^[72]]​[^[73]]​[^[74]]

Cimetidine, an oral H2 receptor antagonist, has been used in the treatment of warts. The proposed mechanism of action is increasing cell-mediated immunity by blocking T-suppressor cells on H2 receptors. A dose of 30–50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for up to 3 months was effective in open-label studies,​[^[75]]​[^[76]]​[^[77]] but ineffective in small randomized controlled trials.​[^[78]]​[^[79]]​[^[80]]

A dermatologist referral is necessary if there are symptomatic, recalcitrant warts; multiple warts in immunocompromised patients; facial lesions unresponsive to topical therapy; or in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain.​[^[81]]

A summary of treatment recommendations for common and flat (plane) warts can be found in Table 2.

Information on the safety of wart treatments during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 3.

| Glutaraldehyde, topical | Not recommended. Lack of data; known link between occupational exposure to similar agents and adverse pregnancy outcomes.​[90] | No data on transfer to milk; however, topical use of small amounts on warts is not predicted to result in significant levels. |
| Imiquimod, topical | Limited human data suggests low risk.​[92] | Probably compatible. No data on transfer into milk, but levels predicted to be insignificant due to limited absorption when applied to skin. Ensure the infant does not come into contact with the treated area. |
| Immunotherapy, intralesional | PPD (tuberculin purified protein derivative) is considered compatible.MMR vaccine: live attenuated vaccines not recommended during pregnancy.No data available for other antigens. | PPD (tuberculin purified protein derivative) is considered compatible.MMR vaccine considered compatible.​[92]No data available for other antigens. |
| Lidocaine (as preprocedural topical anesthetic) | Considered compatible. | Considered compatible. Levels in milk expected to be insignificant. |
| Liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) | Considered compatible. | Considered compatible. No data available, but nitrogen is a nontoxic gas unlikely to appear in milk or be absorbed by a nursing infant. |
| Podophyllum, topical | Not recommended. One cohort study did not find an association with adverse fetal outcomes.​[93] | Not recommended. No data available. |
| Salicylic acid, topical | Considered compatible. Use in limited areas for limited time periods and avoid occlusive dressings. | Considered compatible.
