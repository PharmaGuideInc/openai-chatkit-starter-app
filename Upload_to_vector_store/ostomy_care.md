#### Introduction

An ostomy is an artificial opening made surgically in the body for the purpose of discharging feces and urine. The end of the intestine that protrudes through the artificial opening in the abdominal wall is called a stoma. A colostomy involves the colon, an ileostomy the ileum or small intestine, and a urostomy the urinary tract. Ostomies may be permanent or temporary, and the type of ostomy required depends upon the condition being treated.

An estimated 13,000 new ostomy surgeries are performed each year in Canada, and approximately 70,000 Canadians live with an ostomy.​[^[1]] In general, ostomies are more common in women than men. Ileostomies, particularly as a result of inflammatory bowel disease, are more common in young women. Colostomies to treat cancer or a disease-related bowel obstruction are more common in older adults. Birth defects account for the majority of ostomies in children.

#### Types of Ostomies

#### Ileostomy

To construct an ileostomy, the entire colon and possibly part of the ileum are removed or bypassed and the ileum end is brought to the skin’s surface. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are the most common reasons for an ileostomy. One may also be required because of trauma, cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis or necrotizing enterocolitis.

For some patients, instead of an ileostomy, the surgeon creates a continent fecal diversion, such as an ileoanal reservoir (“S” or “J” pouch). In this procedure, a permanent external ostomy pouch is not needed. The entire colon and rectum are removed and the ileum is refashioned into an internal pouch with the end of the ileum joined to the anal canal. The internal pouch serves as a reservoir, which is able to store waste material that can then be eliminated in the normal way.

#### Colostomy

To construct a colostomy, part of the colon is removed or bypassed and the colon end is brought to the skin’s surface. The different types of colostomies are illustrated in Figure 1. While colorectal cancer is the most common indication, a colostomy may be required due to obstruction of the colon or rectum, genetic malformation, trauma, radiation colitis, loss of anal muscle control or diverticular disease.

Temporary ileostomies and colostomies are sometimes performed to allow a diseased, traumatized and/or surgically repaired bowel to heal. Once the bowel has healed, the ostomy is surgically closed (reversed).

Table 1 describes the characteristic output that is associated with ileostomies and colostomies.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Ileostomy | Initially the output is liquid. With time, as the ileum becomes more absorptive, the output becomes semi-solid. The output is continuous and contains enzymes that may cause skin irritation but is less odorous than output from a colostomy. An appliance must be worn at all times. |
| Ascending colostomy (uncommon) | The output is liquid or semi-solid, malodorous and irritating. An appliance must be worn at all times. |
| Transverse colostomy (commonly used for temporary colostomies) | The output is semi-solid, malodorous and irritating. An appliance must be worn at all times. |
| Descending and sigmoid colostomies (more common) | The output is formed. Irrigation may be used to regulate bowel movements and an appliance may not be needed (see Irrigation). |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration showing different types of colostomies. It consists of six diagrams, each depicting a specific type of colostomy procedure. Here's a detailed description of each:

1. **Ascending Colostomy (Right side)**
   - The stoma is located on the right side of the abdomen.
   - The ascending colon is brought to the surface to form the stoma.

2. **Transverse Colostomy (Across the middle of the abdomen)**
   - The stoma is positioned across the middle of the abdomen.
   - The transverse colon is used to create the stoma.

3. **Descending Colostomy (Left side)**
   - The stoma is on the left side of the abdomen.
   - The descending colon is brought out to form the stoma.

4. **Sigmoid Colostomy (Lower left side)**
   - The stoma is located on the lower left side of the abdomen.
   - The sigmoid colon is used to create the stoma.

5. **Loop Colostomy**
   - A loop of the colon is brought to the surface, and an opening is made in the loop to form the stoma.
   - This type of colostomy is often temporary.

6. **Double-barrel Colostomy**
   - Two separate stomas are created.
   - Each end of the divided colon is brought to the surface, forming two stomas.

Each diagram shows the position of the stoma on the abdomen and the section of the colon used. The illustrations highlight the anatomical differences and placement of each type of colostomy.

#### Urostomy

Urostomies (urinary diversions) are most common in infants and the elderly. They are performed to correct bladder loss or dysfunction resulting from genetic malformation, cancer or neurogenic bladder. They allow for the elimination of urine through an opening in the abdominal wall. Because urine always remains liquid and is discharged continuously, an appliance is usually required. There are many types of urostomies (see Figure 2):



![](images/ostomycarepsc_ost.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration showing different types of urinary diversion techniques. There are five diagrams, each labeled with a specific type of procedure. Here's a detailed description of each:

1. **Ileal Conduit**:
   - The illustration shows a segment of the ileum (part of the small intestine) being used to create a conduit for urine diversion. The ureters are connected to this segment, which is then brought out to the abdominal wall to form a stoma.

2. **Colonic Conduit**:
   - Similar to the ileal conduit, but a segment of the colon is used instead. The ureters are attached to this colonic segment, which is then brought to the surface of the abdomen to create a stoma.

3. **Unilateral Ureterostomy**:
   - This diagram shows one ureter being directly brought to the abdominal wall to form a stoma. The other ureter is not shown as being diverted in this illustration.

4. **Bilateral Ureterostomy**:
   - Both ureters are shown being brought to the abdominal wall separately, each forming its own stoma.

5. **Transureteroureterostomy**:
   - This illustration depicts one ureter being connected to the other, with the second ureter then being brought to the abdominal wall to form a single stoma.

Each diagram provides a visual representation of how the urinary system is altered in these procedures to divert urine away from the bladder.

#### Patient Assessment

A healthy stoma is shiny, moist and either dark pink or red (see Photo, Healthy Stoma). It has no pain sensation because it does not contain nerve fibres. The stoma size in adults usually ranges from 2–5 cm depending upon the portion of the bowel or urinary tract used. After surgery, it shrinks gradually over several months to its permanent size. A careful history and inspection of the ostomy site can help determine whether the patient is experiencing a problem. See Common Problems section for more information.

![](images/ostomycare_heasto_ma.jpg)


**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a skin surface with a prominent, raised, red lesion. The lesion appears to be smooth, dome-shaped, and has a shiny surface. It is located on a slightly erythematous (reddened) area of skin. The surrounding skin shows some mild redness but appears otherwise unremarkable. The lesion's appearance is consistent with a vascular or possibly inflammatory skin condition. There are no visible text labels or annotations in the image.

#### Goals of Ostomy Care



#### Appliances and Accessories

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Ostomy Products: Adult Appliances; Pediatric Appliances; Protectants, Adhesives and Cleansers.

#### Appliances

Appliances are used to collect output from the stoma; most stomas require the patient to wear a containment appliance. The ideal ostomy appliance permits effective containment with no leakage, does not damage skin and is odour-free.

An ostomy appliance includes the pouch, which collects output, and the skin barrier with a flange (a ring on the skin barrier that attaches to the pouch) or adhesive coupling system. The skin barrier attaches to the skin surrounding the stoma. Appliances are available in various sizes for adult and pediatric patients.

#### Pouches

Pouches (see Figure 3) are available in different lengths and capacities to contain the varying amounts of output. They may be open-ended (drainable) or closed-ended (non-drainable). Whether a drainable or non-drainable pouch is selected depends upon the site of the stoma, the consistency of the output, cost and whether the task of emptying and cleaning the pouch is acceptable to the individual. Open-ended appliances afford frequent emptying and are more often used for ileostomies and unregulated colostomies. It is usually recommended that pouches are emptied when they are one-third to one-half full. If a drainable pouch is used, the drainage end needs to be kept clean.

Pouches are selected based on the individual's choice and that person's ability to care for the ostomy. They come in various lengths, may be clear or opaque, and may have a fabric backing for comfort or discretion. Most pouches are odour proof and some have an embedded charcoal filter to minimize odour while allowing gas to escape.​[^[2]]

#### Skin Barriers and Flanges

Skin barriers keep the skin surrounding a stoma intact by protecting it and keeping it dry. Skin barrier wafers are usually composed of pectin, gelatin and cellulose, and can be flat or convex, rigid or flexible to accommodate different body contours and stoma sizes, shapes and locations. Stomas that drain urine or loose/liquid stool require special barriers commonly labelled for “extended wear.” If the patient has a confirmed allergy to any of the components, it would be best to test the skin barrier before use by applying it to an inconspicuous area of skin for 48 hours.

Flanges are the plastic rings incorporated into skin barrier wafers that are used to attach the pouch. The stoma size determines the size of flange required.

#### One-Piece versus Two-Piece Appliances

Appliances are available as both one- and two-piece units (see Figure 3).

One-piece appliances combine a pouch and a skin barrier in a single unit and attach directly to the skin. While closed-ended appliances are discarded after one use, open-ended versions can be emptied and reused until the skin barrier requires changing.

Two-piece appliances consist of a skin barrier with a flange and a separate pouch. The skin barrier attaches to the skin and the pouch is connected to it via the flange. The pouch can be replaced without disturbing the barrier, and less frequent replacement of the barrier minimizes skin irritation. While some people will clean and reuse a pouch, this is not recommended. The ability to interchange appliance components exists within a manufacturer's line of products but does not usually extend between various manufacturers. Two-piece appliances can be difficult to use if a person has diminished manual dexterity or eyesight.

Figure 4 illustrates the placement of a two-piece ostomy appliance.

![](images/ostomycarepsc_ostapp.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image depicts two types of ostomy appliances: a two-piece closed appliance and a one-piece drainable appliance.

### Two-Piece Closed Appliance (Left Side):
- **Components:**
  - **Skin Barrier:** A circular component that adheres to the skin.
  - **Flange:** A ring-like structure that connects the skin barrier to the pouch.
  - **Pouch:** A separate component that attaches to the flange to collect waste.
  - **Belt Tab:** A feature on the pouch for attaching a support belt.

### One-Piece Drainable Appliance (Right Side):
- **Components:**
  - **Skin Barrier:** Integrated into the appliance, adhering directly to the skin.
  - **Pouch:** Attached directly to the skin barrier, forming a single unit.
  - **Open End for Emptying:** The bottom of the pouch can be opened to drain contents.

### Description:
- The two-piece system allows for the separate attachment of the skin barrier and pouch, providing flexibility in changing either component independently.
- The one-piece system combines the skin barrier and pouch into a single unit, which is typically easier to apply and remove.
- The one-piece appliance features an open end for easy emptying, making it suitable for frequent drainage.

These appliances are used for managing stomas, providing options based on user preference and medical needs.

#### Accessories

#### Powders and Pastes

Skin barrier powders are formulated of pectin, gelatin and cellulose, and are used to absorb moisture from the skin. Skin barrier pastes are also formulated of pectin, gelatin and cellulose, and contain alcohol and preservatives. They are used like caulking to improve the seal between the skin barrier wafer and the skin on the abdomen. Skin barrier paste is also available as strip paste—pre-measured strips that are alcohol-free and can be moulded to the required shape and size.

#### Adhesives

Although no longer in common use, adhesives are applied either as cement, which must dry completely before the appliance is attached, or as a pad. Some adhesives include skin barriers in their formulations. Some ostomy pouches have adhesive integrated into the flange and/or skin barrier, making application simple.

Adhesives are the most common cause of allergies. A patch test should be performed prior to use—apply the product to an inconspicuous area of skin for 48 hours to determine if it causes a reaction.

#### Other Accessories



#### Appliance Fit

Note: Measuring the stoma and fitting an appliance are beyond the scope of this chapter and should be performed only by individuals with specialized training in this area.

The correct appliance fit is paramount. A fitting guide is included with each box of appliances to help determine the correct size based on the stoma. An appliance with an opening smaller than the stoma may cause abrasion of the stoma and poor wearing time. If the opening is larger than the stoma, skin excoriation can result. Other considerations in choosing an appliance include body contour, stoma location, presence of skin creases and scars, and type of ostomy.​[^[3]] Obesity can be a problem in fitting and maintaining an appliance.

The type of appliance may change postsurgically as the stoma heals and the contour of the body changes due to growth, weight changes, aging, pregnancy or concurrent medical conditions.

#### Changing the Appliance

To prevent the weight of the pouch from compromising the seal on the skin, it is recommended to routinely empty the pouch when it is one-third to one-half full.

As the directions for changing appliances vary somewhat between models, the directions accompanying the particular pouch should be consulted. Some general principles do apply:



#### Irrigation

For persons with descending or sigmoid colostomies, irrigation may be an alternative to wearing an appliance; it is less expensive and affords some control of fecal outflow. Irrigation involves emptying the colon by instilling water through the stoma into the intestine to stimulate peristalsis and force waste out; essentially it is an enema through the stoma. Irrigation should be performed at regular intervals, generally every 1–4 days, at the same time of day (often 1 hour after consuming the largest meal of the day, as the meal stimulates bowel peristalsis). After 6–8 weeks of routine irrigation, the bowel will become regulated.



#### Common Problems

Common problems usually involve the stoma or peristomal skin. The actual incidence of skin problems is difficult to determine; however, peristomal skin problems seem to occur frequently, involving anywhere from 18–55% of persons with an ostomy.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Functional, psychological and social factors may contribute to ostomy problems. Poor manual dexterity, visual problems, clothing incompatibilities and dietary issues can lead to appliance leakage and odour. Other issues, such as depression, anxiety, sexual or body image concerns, lack of education about the stoma, and inability to return to work, can exacerbate any problem.

#### Peristomal Skin Problems

#### Allergies

Skin barrier adhesives and pastes are the most common cause of allergies, and allergic contact dermatitis is the most common manifestation (itching; burning or stinging; redness; areas of moist, denuded skin).​[^[6]] A switch to another adhesive or appliance may be necessary. A skin barrier may help, but it needs to extend beyond the damaged area. The majority of modern appliances are latex-free, reducing the risk of a latex allergy.

#### Folliculitis

Folliculitis is inflammation of hair follicles around the stoma and is characterized by redness at the base of the hair follicles. Aggressive removal of an appliance may pull hair from follicles, resulting in inflammation and infection. Shaving the area surrounding the stoma will prevent folliculitis; an electric razor is preferred because it will leave the skin intact. Clipping the hair is an alternative if shaving with an electric razor causes skin damage.

#### Infections

Infections can occur under the skin barrier and/or flange. These may be bacterial or fungal; culture and sensitivity testing may be needed to identify the pathogen responsible and ensure appropriate treatment. Proper maintenance is important in preventing infections.

Ostomy sites are susceptible to fungal infections with Candida species because they provide a warm, moist environment conducive to fungal growth. The primary symptom of cutaneous candidiasis is itching accompanied by a red rash with satellite lesions.​[^[7]] With an unchecked infection, skin excoriation and additional skin irritation can occur. Use of broad spectrum antibiotics can contribute to Candida infections by changing the normal flora; thus, knowing a patient's medication history is important.

Antifungal powder such as silver-containing **arglaes** powder (preferred therapy) or **nystatin** powder (alternative therapy) may be used to treat cutaneous candidiasis. The appliance is applied directly over the powder, with any excess powder brushed off. Usually antifungal powder is continued for 1 week after the infection clears; however, if the fungal infection has occurred secondary to treatment with oral antibiotics, the duration of therapy with the antifungal powder may be extended or an oral antifungal agent such as **fluconazole** may be preferred. Creams and ointments should be avoided since they can interfere with the appliance adherence, which may present a challenge for treatment.

Refer any person living with an ostomy to a physician or a nurse specializing in wound, ostomy and continence (NSWOC) if experiencing symptoms of infection, fever, chills, foul odour or purulent output from the stoma.

#### Skin Damage

The most common peristomal skin problem with ostomies is sore skin, usually the result of frequent removal of the appliance. The skin around the stoma becomes damaged—red, swollen, burning, itchy. Skin damage may also be related to mechanical irritation caused by a poor-fitting appliance, a stoma that is difficult to access or clothing that is too tight.

#### Skin Excoriation

Skin excoriation or irritant dermatitis is abrasion of the skin by digestive enzymes, which may result in bleeding, painful skin (see Photo, Peristomal Skin Excoriation). The most common cause is an appliance that is too big for the stoma and allows leakage. Delayed replacement or maintenance may also result in waste material containing digestive enzymes coming into contact with the skin. Choosing the proper size of appliance, changing the appliance at the first sign of leakage, performing routine maintenance of the appliance and using a skin barrier will avoid the problem.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a skin lesion. The lesion appears to be a raised, red, and shiny nodule with a central ulceration. The surrounding skin is also red and inflamed, indicating irritation or infection. The lesion's appearance is consistent with a possible dermatological condition, such as a basal cell carcinoma or another type of skin cancer, but a definitive diagnosis would require further medical evaluation and possibly a biopsy. The image highlights the importance of monitoring skin changes and consulting a healthcare professional for assessment.

#### Bleeding

Bleeding of the stoma is usually the result of aggressive cleaning. Proper cleaning technique is required—gentle yet thorough. If bleeding persists, it may be an indication that the original disease has recurred or that a new condition is developing. Referral to an appropriate health-care professional is necessary.

#### Constipation

Individuals with sigmoid or descending colostomies are prone to constipation; fluid, fibre and exercise are recommended to avoid this problem. The causes of constipation are diverse, but it is often related to medications or diet (see Constipation). Laxatives should be used only on the advice of an individual's health-care practitioner.

#### Diarrhea

Persons with ostomies who are experiencing diarrhea may be at increased risk of fluid and/or electrolyte imbalances (see Table 2 and Table 3). Fluid intake should be increased; oral rehydration solutions may be used to replenish electrolytes. Foods like bananas, potatoes, pasta, applesauce, yogourt, cheese and creamy peanut butter can help thicken the stoma output. Refer ostomy patients with diarrhea to an appropriate health-care practitioner for further assessment.

#### Fluid and Electrolyte Depletion

Persons with an ileostomy lack normal reserve capacity for absorption of water, sodium and potassium, and should be advised to take extra fluid and electrolytes after exercise and in hot weather. Specialized fluid and electrolyte replacement drinks used by athletes are ideal, but beverages with high sugar content should be avoided because they can precipitate diarrhea. Some individuals need routine potassium supplementation, and particular attention should be paid to plasma potassium levels if a diuretic is used.

To avoid dehydration, fluid intake must be sufficient. This is especially important during illness and for infants. Signs and symptoms of dehydration and common electrolyte abnormalities are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

| Children | Adults |
| --- | --- |
| Dry mouth, tongue and skin | Increased thirst |
| Few or no tears when crying | Decreased urination |
| Decreased urination (<4 wet diapers in 24 h) | Feeling weak or lightheaded |
| Sunken eyes | Dry mouth/tongue |
| Greyish skin |  |
| Sunken soft spot (fontanel) in infants |  |
| Decreased skin turgor |  |


| Hyponatremia | Hypokalemia |
| --- | --- |
| Nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, altered level of alertness/consciousness | Muscle weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased sensation in arms and legs, abdominal bloating (secondary to paralytic ileus) |


#### Gas

Foods that caused gas prior to surgery usually continue to cause gas after surgery. Careful dietary choices are needed. As well, travel in pressurized aircraft cabins can cause distention of an appliance. Relaxation techniques to reduce stress due to travel can reduce this issue. For patients concerned about odour, some appliances have charcoal filters—the gas is released and the charcoal absorbs the odour.



#### Leakage

Ill-fitting or badly applied appliances may result in leakage around the seal. Proper fit and maintenance of the appliance are the solution to this issue.

#### Odour

Diet is the most common source of odour. Identifying which food is causing the odour and changing the diet usually solves the problem (see Table 4). Pouches usually have an odour barrier and thus are considered odour-free, provided they are changed regularly, emptied as needed, cleaned properly, have no flaws or pinholes, and are reliably sealed. Emptying a pouch is often accompanied by odour.

Deodorants are available to help control odour. These are placed into the pouch after each emptying. Oral deodorants, such as **activated charcoal** and **chlorophyllin copper complex**, act on the digestive system to eliminate odours from digested foods.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Bulk-forming foods | Celery, coconut, coleslaw, dried fruits, foods with seeds or kernels (e.g., corn), meats in casings, nuts, popcorn, whole grains, whole vegetables, wild rice |
| Diarrhea-causing foods | Beer (other alcoholic beverages are not common offenders), broccoli, green beans, highly seasoned food, raw fruit, spinach |
| Gas-producing foods | Beer, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carbonated drinks, cauliflower, chewing gum (if chewed with an open mouth), corn, cucumber, dairy products, dried beans, mushrooms, onion, peas, radish, spinach, string beans |
| Odour-producing foods | Asparagus, beans, broccoli, cabbage, eggs, fish, garlic, onion, peas, some spices, turnip |


#### Structural Problems

#### Fistula Formation, Retraction and Prolapse

Fistula formation appears as leakage around the base of the stoma, causing skin erosion. All fistula formation should be investigated, as it may indicate an underlying disease or condition (e.g., abscess formation, cancer, foreign body retention, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma). The underlying problem should be addressed, and sometimes surgical refashioning of the stoma is required.

Inward retraction of the stoma or outward prolapse of the stoma and/or bowel may occur. Either may be due to the way the stoma was originally fashioned or to major changes in the individual's weight. As well, anything that increases abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, pregnancy) increases the risk of prolapse. If the bowel is prolapsed, strangulation of the bowel can occur. A prolapse should be reduced, and sometimes surgery is required for revision (surgical repair) of the stoma. Retraction may be controlled by the use of a convex appliance, but as with prolapse, surgery may be needed.​[^[13]]

#### Stenosis

Stenosis is a narrowing of the stoma usually caused by the formation of scar tissue due to the surgical construction of the stoma, ischemia, active bowel disease or dermatitis. Dilation and/or surgery may be required for correction.

#### Urostomy-Specific Problems

#### Crystalline Phosphate Deposits

Crystalline phosphate deposits may build up on urostomies, making the stoma fragile and cutting into the mucosa. These deposits are the major cause of blood in a urostomy pouch. To dissolve the crystals, dab vinegar mixed with one-third to two-thirds water on the stoma when the appliance is cleaned. Acidifying the urine by consuming foods containing ascorbic acid, e.g., cranberry juice, will reduce the formation of these deposits. An ammonia odour may be the first sign of this problem; some individuals monitor the urine’s pH with urine dip sticks.

#### Urinary Tract Infections

Individuals with urostomies have an increased risk of UTIs, which may require further assessment and treatment. These patients should be aware of the symptoms of UTI: chills, fever, bloody urine, foul-smelling urine, back pain in the kidney area and abdominal pain. (As a portion of bowel is used to create the stoma, it is not uncommon to see mucus in the output of a urostomy; therefore, cloudy urine is not a sign of UTI in patients with urostomies.) Recalcitrant UTIs may require antibiotic prophylaxis; the choice of antibiotic depends upon factors such as urine culture and sensitivity, renal function, and allergy history.

#### Diet

Unless there are medical contraindications, after the surgical recovery period, individuals can eat a normal, varied diet, making their own adjustments to omit foods that change the consistency of the feces or cause odour or gas (see Table 4).​[^[14]] A food diary may aid in determining foods that are well tolerated and those that cause problems. Fluid intake is important, especially for individuals with an ileostomy or urostomy. Eight to 10 glasses of fluid each day is recommended.​[^[15]] The foods most often cited as causing odour, gas or frequent watery discharge are bran, fish, onions, carbonated beverages and beer.

People with an ileostomy will notice that high-fibre foods remain undigested. Sometimes this undigested food can cause a blockage or obstruction of the stoma. These foods should be introduced into the diet 1 at a time. Eating them in small quantities, chewing well and drinking fluids with them will help avoid problems. Symptoms of obstruction (e.g., no output from stoma; cramping; abdominal pain; vomiting; stoma swelling; and watery, foul-smelling waste material) should be investigated further by an appropriate health-care practitioner.

#### Medication Use

With an ostomy, GI transit times for medications are altered, which may in turn affect the medication's pharmacokinetics. Extended-release formulations may be unsuitable, and some medications are implicated in specific complications seen with ostomies, e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the risk of diarrhea and fungal infections. Table 5 summarizes some medication concerns.

|  |
| --- |
| Drugs that may affect ostomy function |
| Antacids | Aluminum-containing antacids may cause constipation in persons with colostomies; calcium-containing antacids may cause calcium stone formation in persons with urostomies and ileostomies; and magnesium-containing antacids may cause diarrhea in persons with ileostomies. |
| Antibiotics | Broad-spectrum antibiotics may alter the normal flora of the intestinal tract resulting in diarrhea or fungal infections of the skin surrounding the stoma. For persons with urostomies, the use of sulfa-containing antibiotics may lead to crystallization in the urine when high concentrations are reached or when the urine is acidic. Persons with urostomies who use urinary acidifiers to prevent urinary tract infection or encrustations are at high risk of sulfa crystal development in the kidneys or ureters. Discontinue urinary acidifiers when treating with sulfa-containing antibiotics. |
| Antidiarrheals | May cause constipation and possible obstruction in persons with colostomies. |
| Antimotility drugs | May cause constipation in persons with colostomies and in some with ileostomies. |
| Corticosteroids | Immunosuppressants may delay healing and increase risk of infections. |
| Diuretics | May cause excess fluid loss and dehydration; with ileostomies, monitor fluid balance and electrolytes. |
| Laxatives | May result in perforations of colostomies and cause high risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in persons with ileostomies. Enemas should not be used with ileostomies. |
| Opioids | May cause constipation. |
| Salt substitutes | May cause hyponatremia in persons with ileostomies. |
| Sulfa drugs | Crystallization in the kidney may be more prominent if the individual is having difficulty with fluid and electrolyte balance; this is more common with urostomies. Good fluid intake is required. |
| Drugs that may be ineffective because they are poorly absorbed |
| Digoxin | Variable bioavailability depending on length of bowel; monitor serum digoxin levels. |
| Oral contraceptives | May not be adequately absorbed in some persons with ileostomies; consider non-oral contraception. |
| Vitamins A, D, E, K, B12 | Variable absorption can occur with extensive resection of the ileum; ensure adequate dietary intake, consider supplementation.​[5] |
| Warfarin | Hypoprothrombinemia has occurred in some patients with short bowel syndrome; monitor INR. |
| Drug formulations that may be problematic |
| Drugs that discolour the feces | Examples: iron (black), bismuth (greenish-black), amitriptyline (blue or green), phenothiazines (pinkish-red), vitamin B12 (yellow), salicylates (pink to red or black), senna (yellow), aluminum-containing antacids (whitish or speckled). |
| Enteric-coated or timed-release formulations | Enteric-coated formulations that require the alkaline environment of the small intestine to dissolve may pass through the intestinal tract intact. They are often ineffective in persons with ileostomies and only partially effective for those with colostomies. Checking in the pouch for undissolved tablets will identify the problem; alternatives include chewable tablets and liquids. Avoid timed-release preparations, especially with an ileostomy. |


#### Lifestyle Considerations

Assure persons with an ostomy that they can wear their usual clothing and that the pouch will not be visible if it is changed and emptied as necessary. Clothing or shapewear with tight elastic may need to be adapted with an opening to prevent pressure on the stoma and pouch.

Having an ostomy does not necessarily interfere with exercise, sports, occupational work or sexual activity; however, it is recommended to avoid very heavy lifting and extremely rough contact sports because of the potential for injury to the stoma. Specialized stomal caps and pouches are available for wear when swimming. Choosing beachwear with patterned fabrics and boxer-style swim trunks and using a smaller-sized pouch or emptying the regular-sized pouch may help an ostomy patient feel more comfortable on the beach.​[^[16]]

Bathing and showering is possible with or without the appliance in place. Soap and water will not injure a stoma, but bath oils and soaps may leave a greasy film that can prevent the appliance from adhering to the skin. If a long soak in the bathtub is contemplated and the stoma will be below the water line, a cap can be used to prevent water from seeping into the stoma and the bowel. A person with a urinary stoma who wishes to attach a night drainage system to the appliance will require a free-standing holder or one that slides between the box spring and mattress.

Hot weather or physical activity can cause sweating between the appliance and skin, which can be uncomfortable and may lead to skin problems. Some antiperspirants may be used on the skin; however, check with an NSWOC. An adhesive change or the use of a breathable skin barrier are other management options. With education, persons with an ostomy will continue to enjoy their previous quality of life.
