CPhA acknowledges the contribution of Dr. Raj Padwal as a previous author of this chapter.CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “men,” “males,” “women” and “females” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

High blood pressure (hypertension) is the leading cause of death or disability in the world.​[^[1]] Approximately 1.4 billion individuals, or 31% of adults, have hypertension globally.​[^[2]] In Canada, approximately 23% of adults, or 7.5 million individuals, have hypertension and nearly 65% have achieved target BP levels.​[^[3]] Control in women has deteriorated over the past decade and is now under 50%.​[^[4]]

Regulation of BP is complex and is controlled by several physiological systems. Important influencers include the autonomic nervous system, renin-angiotensin axis, kinin-kallikrein system, cardiac function and output, vascular function, and renal salt and water balance. Additional factors that commonly lead to BP variation include body position, emotional state, external temperature and activity. Two major drivers of elevated BP are obesity (especially in the young) and vascular stiffness. Elevated BP leads to cardiovascular and renal complications. Important sequelae are stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and dementia.​[^[5]] Consider screening adults for hypertension annually, more often in those with borderline-high blood pressure or diabetes.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

The choice of therapy is determined by the measured BP values:



Consider performing a pregnancy test in patients of childbearing age prior to initiating antihypertensive drugs. Also consider discussing plans for future pregnancy to optimize medication selection. 

Consider therapy for dyslipidemia if the patient meets the current Canadian criteria (see Dyslipidemias).

In general, the reduction in cardiovascular risk depends more on the extent of the reduction in BP than on the specific antihypertensive medication.​[^[9]] Pharmacologic therapy should usually be started with a low dose of the initial drug or combination therapy. Hypertension Canada (HC) guidelines suggest avoiding ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line antihypertensive drugs for Black patients. The data supporting this recommendation is not robust, which may inadvertently lead to underuse of ACE inhibitors or ARBs where appropriate, e.g., as second- or third-line antihypertensive.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] Consider all concurrent risk factors and disease states regardless of race when selecting initial therapy (see Table 6). 

Dose titration to achieve goal BP should be done approximately every 4 weeks for all but those with severe hypertension, target organ damage or high cardiovascular risk for whom closer follow-up and more frequent dosage titration is required. Lack of control over BP is in most cases due to a failure to titrate therapy (adding drugs and/or increasing doses) in response to high office readings. Greater confidence in office readings can result from supplementing with home BP measurements or ambulatory 24-hour monitors. Generally, high readings should trigger a dosage increase, addition of another medication, investigations to identify the cause of the high readings or a follow-up appointment within 2–4 weeks to reassess BP. Medications that can be considered are shown in Table 7.

#### Diuretics

Extensive evidence supports low-dose thiazide or related diuretics (e.g., indapamide) as first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension. They should generally be selected unless there are specific indications for other drugs (see Table 6). They have proven antihypertensive effectiveness in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the elderly and Black patients.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] Trial data for cardiovascular benefit are more consistent for long-acting diuretics such as chlorthalidone and indapamide than for hydrochlorothiazide, but a recent head-to-head study suggested no difference in major CV events.​[^[14]]​[^[15]]

Diuretics can cause hypokalemia that may be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Consider alternative first-line agents in those with or strongly predisposed to a serious arrhythmia, e.g., prolonged QT syndrome. Consider using a combination product to minimize the risk of hypokalemia (hydrochlorothiazide plus a potassium-sparing diuretic—spironolactone, amiloride or triamterene). Reserve the use of high doses (e.g., >25 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazide) for patients with resistant hypertension unresponsive to treatment with multiple drugs or secondary to renal impairment. Consider using a loop diuretic in patients with renal impairment. Diuretics may worsen dysglycemia, although cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes who are treated with diuretics are similar to those treated with ACE inhibitors.​[^[13]]

#### Beta1-Adrenergic Antagonists

Beta1-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers) are first-line therapy in patients who are younger than 60 years of age, or who have stable angina, heart failure or a history of MI. Beta-blockers are also useful in patients who have migraine headaches, tachycardia or essential tremor. However, beta-blockers are not as effective as ARBs, CCBs or diuretics as initial therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients over 60 years of age.​[^[16]]

#### Drugs That Act via the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in modulating BP, kidney function, electrolyte balance, and vascular and cardiac structure. Drugs that act directly on this system include ACE inhibitors, **angiotensin receptor blockers**, direct renin inhibitors and spironolactone. Antihypertensive drugs that stimulate the RAAS axis (e.g., diuretics) are as effective as those that block this system in preventing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, some inhibitors of the RAAS do provide additional benefits in certain patients, including those with heart failure, diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease. ACE inhibitors, ARBs and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant patients.​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Drugs from these classes should not be prescribed in those of childbearing potential unless the risks are carefully weighed and adequate measures are taken to prevent pregnancy (see Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding).

#### Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors are first-line agents for patients with uncomplicated hypertension and for patients with diabetes, ischemic heart disease, recent MI, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. 

#### Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers

ARBs are first-line agents for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, diabetes or ischemic heart disease. They are good alternatives when ACE inhibitors are specifically indicated but not tolerated. 

#### Direct Renin Inhibitors

Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, prevents renin from converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. The drug has a long duration of action and may lower BP to the same extent as drugs from other antihypertensive classes. Large-scale trials examining morbidity and mortality endpoints are lacking. Aliskiren can be used as an add-on agent after all first-line therapies have been tried. However, especially in patients with diabetes, it should not be combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs because outcomes are poorer and adverse effects such as hyperkalemia are higher.

#### Long-Acting Calcium Channel Blockers

Long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs can be used as first-line agents. *Short-acting formulations* of these agents (nifedipine) have caused an increase in cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials and should *not* be used, except in the acute management of severe hypertension in pregnancy (see Hypertension and Pregnancy, Management). Elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension are particularly responsive to CCBs.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] 

#### Other Antihypertensive Drugs

In general, other classes of antihypertensive drugs should not be prescribed unless there are specific indications (see Table 6), contraindications or intolerance to first-line therapy, or a requirement for additional BP lowering in combination with first-line antihypertensive drugs.

#### Combination Therapy

About 50% of patients will require more than 1 antihypertensive agent to achieve BP targets.​[^[13]] If the goal BP is not achieved with moderate doses of a suitable first-line drug, add, rather than substitute, a second drug. Combining 2 drugs from different classes yields a 5 times greater incremental reduction in BP than doubling the dose of 1 drug.​[^[20]] 

#### 2-drug combinations

The recommendation from HC is to initiate therapy with a combination of 2 first-line agents. This is especially useful if a patient’s SBP is ≥20 or DBP is ≥10 mm Hg above the recommended target.​[^[6]] A synergistic effect is often seen when ACE inhibitors or ARBs are combined with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and when ACE inhibitors or ARBs are combined with CCBs. In high-risk patients (hypertension with diabetes or known cardiovascular disease), HC guidelines specifically recommend consideration of an ACE inhibitor with amlodipine in patients whose BP requires 2 or more medications for control based on the results of a randomized, controlled trial.​[^[21]]

Any combination of a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB has less than additive antihypertensive effects when combined in a 2-drug regimen. These combinations should be avoided unless there is a specific indication, e.g., use of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker in post-MI patients or in those with heart failure (see Table 6). 

#### 3- and 4-drug combinations

All possible combinations of first-line agents are rational choices to lower BP when 3 or 4 drugs are required, with the exception of the simultaneous prescription of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. A combination of an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB is associated with more adverse effects (e.g., hyperkalemia, renal impairment) and no clear benefit in terms of cardiovascular events despite a further lowering of BP.​[^[22]] This combination is generally not recommended for the treatment of hypertension, though it may be appropriate in some medical circumstances such as refractory heart failure.

#### Adherence

Medication adherence should be assessed at each visit. Poor adherence to therapy is a major cause of poor BP control. Evening dosing has been suggested to provide better outcomes,​[^[23]] but these findings have been refuted by the TIME trial.​[^[24]] At this point, there appears to be no advantage in using bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medications routinely.

Patients may admit to poor adherence when questioned in a nonconfrontational manner, or it may be indicated by:



Poor adherence can be prevented. Routine care should include the following:



Treat poor adherence:



#### Resistant Hypertension

Resistant hypertension is defined as BP that is above target despite treatment with 3 drugs, optimally dosed, 1 of which is a diuretic (typical “optimal” regimen is a long-acting ACE inhibitor or ARB, thiazide-like diuretic, and dihydropyridine CCB). Resistant hypertension has been estimated to affect about 10% of hypertensive patients, but the true prevalence is likely much lower because many patients have either white coat effect or are not adherent.​[^[25]] Hence, all patients with suspected resistant hypertension should undergo 24-hour ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) and have adherence assessed. If there is no nocturnal dipping found on 24-hour ABPM, screening for sleep apnea is indicated and moving 1 or more medication doses to the evening may be beneficial. Other potential causes that should be looked for are secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction; in those with a poor response to an adequate combination of medications, consider the possibility of an “interfering lifestyle,” e.g., high dietary sodium intake. Therapeutic options as add-on therapy to the optimal 3-class regimen described above include spironolactone, amiloride, bisoprolol, doxazosin and clonidine.​[^[26]] Refer (to a hypertension specialist, nephrologist or internist) those who do not achieve BP targets with medication regimens you feel comfortable prescribing.

#### Hypertensive Emergencies

It is uncommon for elevated BP alone, without new or progressive target organ damage, to require emergency therapy. Refer true hypertensive emergencies to experienced centres with facilities to continuously monitor BP. In stabilizing patients for transfer, the use of intermediate-acting drugs (e.g., felodipine) with close BP monitoring is generally safer than using short-acting drugs that can rapidly produce hypotension with complications.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Hypertension and Pregnancy

Inform patients with pre-existing hypertension who are of childbearing potential, particularly those who are considering pregnancy, that they are at an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction; placental abruption; preterm delivery and the attendant neonatal risks of prematurity; and particularly a heightened risk of preeclampsia, with a crude risk of about 20–25% (varying with the severity and duration of the pre-existing hypertension). Enhanced surveillance is required during pregnancy (ideally by an obstetrician or perinatologist) to monitor for these complications. Prior to conception, or immediately upon recognition of an unplanned pregnancy, review the choice of antihypertensive medication and consider substitution of agents with the best safety profiles. Patients at high risk of preeclampsia (including all patients with chronic hypertension) should be offered ASA (81–162 mg taken daily at bedtime) beginning after conception, but prior to 16 weeks’ gestational age and discontinued by around 36 weeks’ gestation.​[^[27]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]Patients with a low dietary intake of calcium (<900 mg/day) should receive supplementation of at least 500 mg daily of oral calcium.​[^[27]]​[^[30]]

#### Management

While there remains a dearth of high-quality data on the effects of many common antihypertensive medications on the developing fetus, international guidelines​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]] have reached some consensus regarding a list of “preferred” medications for use in pregnancy, as well as a few “avoid” and “must avoid” drugs. Antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be initiated for sustained BP >140/90 and maintained or adjusted to achieve the BP target of 120–140/80–90. Medications widely considered first-line for the management of hypertension include labetalol (100 mg BID to 800 mg TID) and nifedipine XL (30 mg daily to 60 mg BID). Methyldopa (250 mg BID to 1000 mg TID) is also an acceptable choice, but is chosen less frequently due to its lesser potency and its frequent side effects.​[^[32]] These medications are preferred as they have evidence and/or a strong clinical record of safe and effective use in pregnancy​[^[35]]​[^[36]] as well as an absence of demonstrated adverse effects on subsequent neonatal and childhood development. Other oral beta-blockers (acebutolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol) can also be considered, though they are used infrequently for this indication. For the acute management of severe hypertension in pregnancy (SBP ≥160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥110 mm Hg), rapid lowering of BP is recommended with either immediate-release oral nifedipine (5–10 mg every 30 min as required), parenteral labetalol (20 mg IV; repeat 20–80 mg IV every 30 min as required) or parenteral hydralazine (5 mg IV; repeat 5–10 mg IV every 30 minutes as required).​[^[27]] Other oral antihypertensive medications that can potentially be used in pregnancy after the above agents have been considered include clonidine, hydralazine and **thiazide** diuretics.​[^[31]]

Avoid atenolol, as its use for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy has been associated with fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).​[^[37]] The other beta-blockers, in contrast, are only weakly associated with IUGR and have been used widely in pregnancy for various indications. Thiazide diuretics and **loop** diuretics may prevent the physiologic volume expansion seen in normal pregnancy, and thereby impair uteroplacental perfusion and fetal growth.​[^[38]] Available data do not support an adverse effect on perinatal outcome,​[^[32]] however, and these medications may therefore be considered or continued in patients felt to have volume-dependent hypertension (renal impairment). They should be avoided in settings in which uteroplacental perfusion is already reduced (preeclampsia or IUGR). Spironolactone should not be used at all in pregnancy, due to its anti-androgenic effects.​[^[39]] 

ACE inhibitors have clearly been shown to be fetotoxic when taken during the second and third trimesters,​[^[40]] leading to oligohydramnios, IUGR, fetal/neonatal renal failure and other growth effects. First-trimester exposure has also been associated with teratogenic effects, mainly to the fetal cardiovascular and central nervous system, though these are likely due to confounding by undiagnosed diabetes.​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]] These medications should generally be discontinued prior to conception or promptly upon discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Cautious continuation during the periconceptual period may be considered in patients with proteinuric renal disease, along with frequent pregnancy testing and immediate switching to a preferred agent upon confirmation of pregnancy. The data regarding the risk of fetal harm from ARBs​[^[45]] and direct renin inhibitors​[^[46]] are less robust (mainly animal data), but they appear to have similar harmful effects and should be avoided just as strictly as ACE inhibitors during pregnancy. 

Most patients with pre-existing hypertension, particularly those with long-standing, difficult-to-control hypertension or end-organ damage, should be followed throughout pregnancy by a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology. These clinicians are skilled at ongoing maternal management as well as appropriate monitoring of fetal growth and well-being. Patients with difficult-to-control hypertension or other medical issues benefit from assessment and follow-up with a hypertension specialist or obstetric medicine physician during their pregnancy.

#### Hypertension and Breastfeeding

Following the completion of a pregnancy, many patients require ongoing antihypertensive therapy. The choice of antihypertensive agent may be influenced by whether or not the person is breastfeeding, as all oral medications appear in breast milk to some degree.​[^[47]] Those who are breastfeeding may safely continue treatment with any “pregnancy-preferred” drug in the postpartum period. These include labetalol, long-acting nifedipine and methyldopa. If the use of an ACE inhibitor is strongly favoured, preferred agents include captopril, enalapril, benazepril and quinapril.​[^[48]] 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
