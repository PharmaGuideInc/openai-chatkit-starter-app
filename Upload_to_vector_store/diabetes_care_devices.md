#### Diabetes Management

Diabetes care depends upon the daily commitment of those with diabetes to self-management practices. They must evaluate the impact of medications, diet, sleep and physical activity on their blood glucose based on guidance from their health-care practitioners. The primary goals of therapy are to maintain blood glucose within a therapeutic range and avoid both acute and long-term complications. Technological developments in glucose testing have reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and have improved the quality of life for people with diabetes.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Real-time glucose data supports patient decision-making and reduces the cognitive load associated with daily monitoring. This may reduce disease burden and motivate positive behaviours relating to food and physical activity. 

#### Blood Glucose Levels

Optimal blood glucose (BG) levels are associated with a reduced risk of complications (see Table 1); therefore, attaining BG values close to “normal” has been a central goal in diabetes management. However, achieving near-normal BG in people with diabetes has been limited by severe adverse effects (e.g., hypoglycemia), diminished quality of life and/or cost. Both HbA1c and BG values provide critical information for predicting acute and long-term outcomes associated with diabetes.

|  | HbA1c (%) | FPG or Preprandial PG (mmol/L) | 2-Hour Postprandial PG (mmol/L) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typical adult (>18 y) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes | ≤7​[a] | 4–7 | 5–10(5–8 if HbA1c targets not being met) |
| Pregnant patient with gestational or type 1 or type 2 diabetes | <6.1 | <5.3 | <6.7 |

Fasting BG >5.6 mmol/L is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease; however, postprandial hyperglycemia appears to be a better predictor, with values >7.8 mmol/L associated with an increase in all-cause mortality, and values >10 mmol/L with both microvascular complications and risk of MI.​[^[3]] Blood glucose levels correlate well with HbA1c levels (see Table 2). When HbA1c values are high, the major influence is the fasting BG. When HbA1c levels approach 7%, postprandial plasma glucose becomes more significant.​[^[3]]

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HbA1c (%) | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| Estimated average blood glucose over 3 months (mmol/L) | 5.4 | 7.0 | 8.6 | 10.2 | 11.8 | 13.4 | 14.9 | 16.5 |


Glycemic targets should be individualized based on the patient’s age, duration of diabetes, risk of severe hypoglycemia, pregnancy status, incidence of microvascular complications and/or cardiovascular disease, and life expectancy.​[^[3]] More intensive control with an HbA1c <6.5% may be beneficial if it can be achieved without a significant increase in hypoglycemia and may be appropriate in patients with a shorter duration of diabetes, no evidence of significant cardiovascular disease and a longer life expectancy.​[^[3]] A less conservative HbA1c target of <8.5% may be considered in the frail elderly, those with dementia or a limited life expectancy, a higher level of functional dependency, a history of severe hypoglycemia, or hypoglycemia unawareness.​[^[3]]

#### Glucose Monitoring

Glucose monitoring is imperative for the identification and treatment of hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes and informs adjustments in diabetes medications, particularly with insulin treatment. If used appropriately, it can provide valuable feedback on the effects of diet and lifestyle interventions and may empower patients with diabetes to engage in self-care behaviours.​[^[5]]

Essential components of self-management education include:​[^[6]] 



#### Frequency of Testing

Health-care practitioners can assist patients in determining the frequency and timing of their BG measurements, since the quality of evidence to support testing is variable.​[^[7]] Factors to consider are the potential benefits of monitoring versus cost and pain associated with the procedure, as well as diabetes type, type of antihyperglycemic therapy, changes to antihyperglycemic therapy, adequacy of glycemic control, literacy and numeracy skills, propensity to hypoglycemia, awareness of hypoglycemia, occupational requirements, and acute illness.​[^[6]] Patients who may benefit from regular BG testing are described in Table 3. The Diabetes Canada website has an interactive tool to help patients determine how often to test, along with a recommended pattern of testing. It is important that health-care professionals remind patients that a postprandial test is taken 2 hours after meals.

Canadian guidelines now indicate that all patients using insulin more than once a day should test their blood sugar at least 3 times per day.​[^[6]] This practice is associated with up to a 1% reduction in HbA1c levels, assists in the evaluation of antihyperglycemic therapy effectiveness, and prevents or detects hypoglycemia. Best practices indicate that patients using multiple daily injections or wearing an insulin pump should test at least before each meal and prior to bed, adjusted to patient-specific factors, whereas those injecting only once-daily insulin benefit from testing a minimum of 1–2 times per day, depending on patient-specific factors.​[^[6]]​[^[9]] More frequent testing, such as preprandial and postprandial testing, as well as occasional nocturnal measurements, may be required to reduce hypoglycemic risk or to achieve optimal glycemic control.​[^[10]] 

Studies find that testing proves to be most beneficial within the first 6 months of diagnosis for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin, as it allows them to evaluate how various lifestyle choices affect their sugars.​[^[11]] To ensure that glycemic targets are being met during this time, test once or twice weekly at different times, measuring pre-meal, post-meal and bedtime values. Testing in these patients has demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c levels of 0.2–0.6% with the largest benefit seen in patients with baseline HbA1c >8%.​[^[12]] Additional testing may be used to achieve postprandial glucose targets, to assess effectiveness of pharmacotherapy or lifestyle changes, or to identify and prevent hypoglycemia in patients using insulin secretagogues.​[^[6]]​[^[8]] Additional testing (more than twice daily) may be suggested for those with an acute illness.​[^[8]]

Daily BG testing is not recommended for prediabetes nor for patients diagnosed with diabetes who are being treated only with diet, lifestyle or medications without significant hypoglycemic risk if they are meeting their glycemic targets.​[^[8]]

#### Blood Glucose Meters

BG meters test whole blood using a capillary blood sample and are therefore also known as capillary blood glucose (CBG) meters. The test provides a snapshot of how much glucose is in a patient’s blood the instant the sample is taken, but does not provide any information on whether glucose levels are rising or falling.

Laboratories use venous plasma glucose (whole blood without red blood cells) as the benchmark, and blood glucose meters are adjusted to give results that correlate with lab test results. At BG levels >4.2 mmol/L, a difference of <15% between meter and laboratory values is considered acceptable.​[^[6]] To confirm that results from a meter remain accurate, it is recommended that laboratory and meter results are compared at least annually or when meter results do not appear to match symptoms, HbA1c or other indicators.

For comparative features of related products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Diabetes Products: Blood Glucose Meters.

There are many meters available, and health-care practitioners can assist patients in choosing an appropriate device by considering the following factors:



#### Testing with a Blood Glucose Meter

Health-care practitioners assisting patients with BG meters must have a thorough knowledge of available products. Demonstrations and detailed owner’s manuals are available. As well, a quick reference guide is available with each meter for rapid consultation. Canadian strips are calibrated to measure glucose in mmol/L, and this cannot be changed by the user. Canadian strips cannot be used in American meters and vice versa. To avoid confusion, patients should be made aware that information designed to the American standard will use units of mg/dL.

Ensure patients know how to use their glucometer before leaving the pharmacy, including how to set the time and date, which side the blood gets drawn into the testing strip, and how to dispose of used tools. Encourage patients to adhere to storage recommendations for their specific test strips. Advise that test strips be kept in their original containers at room temperature or cooler. Test strips deteriorate quickly in direct light and humidity (within 3–14 days), and expired and mishandled test strips can lead to errors in testing.​[^[13]] If your province has annual test strip limits for coverage based on their pharmacotherapy, ensure you review this with patients regularly. 

#### Troubleshooting Blood Glucose Meters

Although newer meters are easier to use, patients may still experience difficulties. Many meters provide directions or error codes that patients or health-care practitioners can verify in the owner’s manual or discuss with the manufacturer’s technical support team.

Most problems are due to:



#### Lancing Devices

The first step in BG monitoring is obtaining a blood sample. A capillary blood sample is collected by puncturing the skin with a lancet, which is a small, lubricated needle. When the lancing device is triggered, the needle is projected into the skin and then quickly retracts within the device to prevent accidental puncture.

Each meter comes with its own lancing device, which may vary significantly in style and appearance from others. Although each functions the same way, it is particularly important to introduce the lancing device to patients as part of the meter education—show them how to load, empty and adjust the lancing depth on the device. All lancing devices have a release function that ejects the lancet without it having to be pulled out. If patients have a difficult time learning to use a new lancing device, encourage them to use one that they are most comfortable with. Some models accept a variety of lancets; however, others have proprietary lancets to go with their specific lancing device.

Since patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infection, the puncture area must be well cleansed. Alcohol swabs are useful during travel, but to prevent pain and drying, washing hands with soap and water is acceptable. Most lancets can be used 2–4 times to maintain sharpness.​[^[17]]

To use a lancet device, rest the cap protecting the lancet against the side of the fleshy finger pad area, exert gentle pressure and press the trigger. Site rotation is very important. Frequent users will rotate between fingers; occasionally, right-handed users might prefer lancing the left hand and vice versa.

To reduce the risk of disease transmission, Health Canada recommends single-use, auto-disabling lancet devices (e.g., Ascensia Single-Let, Accu-Chek Safe-T-Pro Plus or BD Microtainer Contact-Activated Lancet) rather than typical lancing devices in multipatient settings such as clinics, even if a new lancet is used for every patient.

#### Alternate Site Testing

Meters are available that allow the use of blood samples from sites other than the fingertip, such as the forearm, palm of the hand or thigh. During periods of rapid change in BG levels (e.g., after meals, after exercise and during periods of hypoglycemia), fingertip testing is the most accurate.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]] Blood samples taken from the palm near the base of the thumb provide a closer correlation to fingertip samples than the forearm or thigh, particularly at times when blood sugar may not be stable.​[^[21]]

#### Bloodless Glucose Monitoring Systems

Bloodless glucose meters are becoming more common among patients requiring frequent glucose monitoring or for patients who desire a more fulsome picture of their daily glucose profile. These meters monitor glucose concentrations automatically and frequently. In real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM), data is pushed to the reader. In intermittently scanned glucose monitoring (isCGM, also known as flash monitoring), the data must be pulled by the reader. When compared to laboratory values, rtCGM and isCGM devices have similar accuracy to traditional CBG testing but provide patients with more actionable results and greater insight into how their body is affected by food, activity and medications.

Real-time CGM and isCGM systems allow glucose levels in interstitial fluid (ISF) to be monitored remotely. They provide an ISF glucose value at that moment, as well as an arrow indicating the direction and rate that glucose is changing. This information can be especially useful before driving, after exercising or before insulin dosing.

 Differences between CGM and CBG are summarized in Table 4. Though glucose concentrations correlate well between the blood and ISF under steady-state conditions, they can vary between 20–110% during times of rapid BG changes (e.g., after a meal, during or after exercise, after the start of insulin action) due to the time taken for glucose to diffuse between sites.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]] ISF glucose generally correlates with BG, with a lag time of 2–10 minutes depending on the make and model of CGM.

Both systems require a sensor, a tiny electrode inserted subcutaneously, that monitors glucose levels in the ISF. Each rtCGM and isCGM sensor comes with an insertion device that makes the process quick and painless. The readers for the devices provide information on what the ISF glucose is at that moment, an arrow indicator that predicts which direction and how quickly glucose is changing, a graph showing a continuous path of their concentrations, and the remaining life of the current sensor. Patients can annotate their charts with detailed information on diet, activity and medications.

| Feature | Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)​[a] | Capillary Blood Glucose (CBG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patient age | >2 y | Any age |
| Fluid tested | Interstitial fluid | Capillary blood |
| Components | Sensor, reader (may be smartphone), transmitter (some) | BG meter, lancets, test strips, alcohol swabs, cotton balls, sharps container |
| Testing location | Back of upper arm, abdomen or lower back | Finger tips (or alternate sites) |
| Length of wear | 10–14 days | Not applicable |
| Warm-up period | 30–120 min | Not applicable |
| Hypoglycemia alerts | Yes | Not applicable |
| Approximate annual cost | $2,500–$4,000 | $1,300–$2,500(assumes 7 tests/day) |


Some rtCGMs require a transmitter to push sensor readings continuously to a reader, insulin pump or smartphone device where the readings are displayed and from which alarms can be customized for high and low values to prompt intervention before a hyper- or hypoglycemic event. Other devices have the transmitter built in to their sensors. rtCGMs utilize Bluetooth technology to transmit data; a loss of signal alarm indicates a loss of data collection and inability to provide warnings of glucose excursions. Highly clinical trend reports and charts can be viewed when connected to a computer. Using a CGM system chart is like watching a movie—anyone can follow the storyline and anticipate what is going to occur next without the user having to manually check.

The isCGM sensor automatically stores glucose readings every minute for up to 8 hours until the information can be reviewed.​[^[25]] While newer models of isCGMs can act as a rtCGM when used with a smart-device, the proprietary reader only receives glucose data once the reader is scanned  by being passed within 4 cm of the sensor (over most clothes). This allows for regular and discreet monitoring without the need for lancing devices and strips. The isCGM can receive alerts (highs, lows, signal loss) without scanning, but glucose data must be pulled from the scanner at least every 8 hours to have a continuous chart similar to a rtCGM. 

These systems allow patients and their supporters to discover how diet, exercise, medication and lifestyle affect their glucose levels for themselves. Both types of devices allow patients to see how fast, and in what direction, their glucose levels are changing, allowing them to intervene earlier to reduce the frequency and severity of high and low BG episodes, and have the ability to set alarms to alert patients for intervention.​[^[26]]

In patients treated with insulin, CGM systems have been shown to improve HbA1c levels and increase the time spent in target ranges compared to CBG monitoring.​[^[6]]  They also reduce the duration and frequency of mild and severe hypoglycemia, reduce the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia, and improve outcomes for patients with hypoglycemic unawareness.​[^[27]] CGM, used in conjunction with intensive insulin regimens, can be a useful tool to achieve HbA1c goals with type 1 diabetes while minimizing hypoglycemic risk.​[^[6]] When compared to CBG testing, frequent use of isCGM scanning reduces the frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c levels and diabetes distress, while increasing quality of life.​[^[25]]​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]] CGM may be helpful in children to reduce stigma, pain and nocturnal wakening for monitoring, but device selection must be individualized by patient’s age.

Though ISF glucose correlates well with BG, CGM readings should not be used for treatment decisions during times of rapid changes in BG due to the delay caused by glucose diffusing from the blood to the interstitial sites.​[^[26]] The lag time between BG and ISF glucose can be reduced by increasing blood flow to the sampling site by applying controlled pressure,​[^[31]] but the most appropriate action is to perform a CBG test.​[^[26]] Basic insulin adjustments can be made based on CGM data; however, CBG testing may be required to confirm hypoglycemia, to make decisions during or following exercise, and when the displayed value does not correlate with symptoms.​[^[32]] Because they use similar technology, CBG and CGM results can be altered by the same nonprescription medications. Medications such as acetaminophen, ASA and vitamin C can falsely raise or lower glucose values.​[^[33]]​[^[34]]

#### Troubleshooting Bloodless Glucose Meters

Once inserted, CGMs are mostly autonomous; however, the most common issues encountered and some suggested solutions are outlined below:



#### Reviewing Glucose Data

For patients using a traditional blood glucose monitor, advise them to track their results in a BG logbook or to use meters with memory and graphing options so they can share the information with their health-care team. Logbooks are available for no charge from manufacturers. Newer meters can be set up to share results automatically through regular wireless updates. For optimal self-monitoring of BG, patients should be educated on using their meter, interpreting the results and modifying treatment based on current BG levels according to individual guidelines provided by health-care practitioners.​[^[6]]

For those using CGM technology, patients should be educated on and encouraged to use the note-taking function of their device to record dietary intake, physical activity, response to hypoglycemic episodes, and other events that may affect glycemic readings to improve blood glucose interpretation. Many of these devices can be connected to health-care professionals’ platforms for ongoing reporting, remote monitoring and assistance.

Whether using CBG or CGM, it is important to address factors leading to hypoglycemic events first, then adjust therapy to address highs. Patients should be educated on not only how to test their BG, but also on how to respond to BG results. Testing without making the information actionable can lead to the patient having a more negative view of disease management.​[^[35]]

#### Diabetes Management Software

With the appropriate interface, data can be uploaded from glucose meters to a mobile phone or personal electronic device or shared remotely via wireless technology. The software enables patients to see the information in different formats, such as visual charts, candlesticks demonstrating time-in-range, means, variability, deviations from preset goals and much more. This information can easily be printed or shared with health-care practitioners.

The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) report is a standardized summative report from CGMs to facilitate data sharing and interpretation between professionals. Software is available through the manufacturer or can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s website.

 Meters can be connected through cables provided by manufacturers or through Bluetooth once the appropriate drivers and accounts have been installed. Health-care professionals may wish to encourage patients to set up data-sharing during meter set-up and education; professionals must register with the manufacturer to receive shared data.

Some patients may choose to access third-party apps on a mobile device to aid in diabetes management. Software selection should be done carefully since it is not regulated, privacy is not guaranteed and the units of measure in the app may not be compatible with Canadian standards. 

#### Urine Glucose Monitoring

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Diabetes Products: Urine Glucose and Ketone Test Kits.

Urinary glucose measurement is less expensive, but is not appropriate for most patients using insulin as it does not reflect current BG levels and will not detect hypoglycemia. It has been shown to be as effective as BG testing for reducing HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes who attended a structured group education program, with 1 in 5 participants in the urine monitoring arm switching to blood testing over 18 months.​[^[36]] There may be select circumstances under which urine glucose monitoring may be used, such as when BG monitoring is not available, too costly or too painful. 

#### Ketone Monitoring

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Diabetes Products: Urine Glucose and Ketone Test Kits.

When cells do not have enough glucose, the body shifts from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Ketones are a by-product of this process. If insulin activity is absent, BG increases and ketones accumulate in the bloodstream, causing the blood to become acidic. The levels of BG continue to rise, causing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a health crisis accompanied by the following symptoms: thirst, dry mouth, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, abdominal pain, and fruity-smelling breath.

Ketone testing is recommended for those with type 1 diabetes during periods of acute illness accompanied by elevated BG, when preprandial BG levels are >14 mmol/L or when symptoms of DKA are present.​[^[6]] If all of these conditions are present in individuals with type 2 diabetes, ketone testing should also be considered.

In rare cases, patients using SGLT2 inhibitors can experience euglycemic DKA caused by an increased glucagon/insulin ratio that leads to increased lipolysis and increased ketone body reabsorption. Patients should be cautioned on signs and symptoms of DKA to hasten recognition and treatment.​[^[37]]

During DKA, there is a shift in the equilibrium that is usually present among ketone bodies, favouring the formation of betahydroxybutyric acid. Blood assays of this acid have been associated with an earlier detection of DKA than urine testing for acetoacetate or acetone levels.​[^[6]] Ketones can be detected in urine using test strips such as Ketostix; to test for ketones in blood, ketone-measuring test strips are used with a CBG meter such as FreeStyle Precision Neo.

#### Insulin Administration Devices

For comparative features of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Diabetes Products: Insulin Products.

When insulin needs to be administered by injection, it is important that patients receive appropriate training in the device they are using. Consensus guidelines on good injection technique contain tips for optimal insulin administration.​[^[38]]

Insulin pens look like large fountain pens. Instead of drawing insulin from vials, a disposable pen comes prefilled with insulin, or a reusable pen uses replaceable prefilled insulin cartridges. Insulin pens are more convenient, less threatening and easier to use than insulin syringes. For the visually impaired, the audible clicks are a useful guide for selecting the correct number of units to administer.

Once an insulin cartridge is installed into a refillable pen, it can be stored between 2–30°C for up to 28 days. Unused cartridges can be refrigerated and kept until their expiry date. Disposable pens should be refrigerated until opened, then kept at room temperature (below 30°C) for between 28–42 days depending on the insulin brand. Ensure that patients understand the particular technique associated with the use of the pen. Advise patients to keep a few syringes at home in case of pen malfunction.

There are a number of companies in the pen/cartridge market, and patients must be made aware that all pens and cartridges are not interchangeable. Some pens offer the ability to administer half-units of insulin, others are capable of dialling backward if an error is made and some differ in how they deliver the last dose remaining in an individual cartridge. It is important that the patient and health-care professional choose the appropriate pen. 

Needles vary in length and diameter. Needle length ranges from 4–12.7 mm. The diameter will vary from 28–33 gauge, with higher numbers indicating a smaller diameter. Thinner and shorter needles cause less resistance in skin penetration and usually less discomfort for the patient and are therefore preferred. Some patients, such as those with obesity or lipohypertrophy, may find longer needles provide better penetration to the subcutaneous tissue and reduce insulin leakage from the injection site. The use of 12.7 mm needles is generally discouraged to reduce the risk of accidental intramuscular injection. Waiting 3–5 seconds before taking a needle out of the skin after injection will help prevent insulin leakage. If 5 seconds is not sufficient, this interval should be prolonged. Reusing needles diminishes the point sharpness and removes the silicon coating. This may lead to micro-traumas, which are linked to nodule formation; manufacturers recommend single use only.

Syringes can be used for the administration of insulin, but their use has declined significantly with the introduction of insulin pens. Various sizes and measurement increments are available. The 100-unit (1 mL) size has 2-unit increments for measuring larger doses, 50-unit (1/2 mL) syringes have 1-unit increments, and 30-unit (3/10 mL) syringes measure both 1 and 1/2-unit increments. The choice of syringes should be based on the total amount of insulin to be administered, keeping in mind that smaller-volume syringes will offer a more accurate measurement. Occasionally, patients require syringes to be prefilled with measured insulin doses, which should be done according to national compounding standards.​[^[39]]

Insulin has lipogenic actions, making site rotation paramount in preventing lipohypertrophy and ensuring predictable insulin absorption.

#### Insulin Pumps

An insulin pump is a battery-operated device that is designed to be worn 24 hours a day. A small plunger pushes insulin out of a reservoir or cartridge through tubing to a cannula that has been inserted in the patient’s subcutaneous tissue. 

It can be easier to match insulin requirements with lifestyle (allowing for more flexibility with meals and activity) using an insulin pump rather than multiple daily doses of insulin. Insulin pumps provide a constant supply of insulin to the patient, adjustable to the time of day, with the option of providing extra insulin for meals and snacks.

Advantages of pump therapy:​[^[26]]



Disadvantages of pump therapy:​[^[26]]



#### Pump Features

The insulin pump may be worn around the abdominal area, the upper arm, or at various other sites, including the leg. The pump is about the size of a deck of cards and contains a reservoir for fast-acting insulin. Insulin is withdrawn from a vial and moved to the reservoir with a needle-attached adapter. The reservoir typically holds 170–300 units of insulin. The pump can be programmed to set patient-specific basal rates and bolus settings, along with connectivity to a glucose meter and/or computer for reporting activity.

Patients can adjust the pump to provide a bolus amount of insulin according to what and when they are eating. Many insulin pumps help to calculate the dose required based on the number of grams of carbohydrates eaten, but this can be overridden depending on planned activities or other factors. Patients must learn the skill of carbohydrate counting. Some meters have a database of favourite foods, which can make the calculations easier and faster. The pump can also be programmed to provide the bolus all at once for a regular meal or over a period of time (e.g., 1–2 h) when a patient wishes to eat small amounts more frequently.​[^[26]]

Insulin pumps can be linked to either blood or bloodless glucose meters through wireless technology, and adjustments to insulin delivery can be made and monitored. Some devices communicate directly with the insulin pump, allowing for automated basal rate adjustments. 

Traditionally, insulin pumps deliver insulin from a refillable reservoir to the body through an “infusion set,” which consists of tubing and a needle or cannula that is inserted beneath the skin. Infusion sets are available with 4 lengths of tubing, ranging from 18 inches (46 cm) to 43 inches (110 cm). These lengths allow users to wear their pumps in a variety of locations and adapt to different activities. The tubing needs to be replaced every 6 days, but is usually changed at the same time as the cannula. For SC administration, patients have a choice between steel needles (which must be changed every 1–2 days) or soft Teflon cannula sets (which can be used for 2–3 days). These are available in 2 or 3 lengths and are designed to be inserted either at a 90-degree angle or at a 30- to 45-degree angle. An autoinjector is available to assist insertions. The 90-degree insertion provides better penetration for patients with obesity. Shorter needles can be used (an advantage for those with needle phobias), but they are more prone to kinking, which may inhibit insulin flow.​[^[26]]

Insulin pumps can also be “tubeless.” The reservoirs for these pumps are encased with an internal cannula and autoinjector, with an adhesive to stick directly to the skin at any site normally recommended for insulin administration. These reservoirs can only be filled before application and neither the remaining insulin nor the reservoir is reusable. The pump communicates with its management device via Bluetooth technology.

Pharmacists can assist patients who are using pumps by having consumable supplies available. These include infusion sets, reservoirs, transparent dressings, batteries and adhesive removers.

For information on available insulin pumps, consult the Diabetes Canada website (see Resources).

#### Miscellaneous Supplies

Plastic syringe cases allow for the transportation of 1–7 prefilled syringes without accidentally applying pressure to the plunger. This tool is excellent for health-care practitioners who prefill and deliver insulin to patients with special needs.

Travel kits organize all diabetes needs in one place. Most travel kits contain either ice packs or air-cool packs that contain crystals activated by the addition of water, which are useful for patients travelling to areas of extreme temperature.

Sharps containers (which are tamper-proof) should be used to dispose of used syringes, needles and lancets. The containers should be taken to a needle disposal site for safe destruction. There are also manual and electric needle cutters that retain the exposed needle in a compartment, which when full can be safely destroyed.

Logbooks can be used by patients to record their blood glucose results, diet and activity level.

Specialized socks provide extra cushioning and warmth while wicking perspiration away from the feet. They also have loose elastics and no rough seams, so as not to impair circulation or irritate the feet. The long-term benefit of using these in foot care has not been established.

Callus and blister protectors are also useful for individuals with diabetes in order to prevent damage to the skin on the feet.

Glucose gels or tablets are a useful means to treat hypoglycemia by providing an exact amount of sugar in a convenient format. Tablets are recommended over gels because they are faster-acting. It is important that patients are instructed on how many tablets to use to treat a hypoglycemic episode (see Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)—What You Need to Know).

Glucagon is a hormone that counteracts the action of insulin. It stimulates the release of glucose from the liver into the bloodstream, thereby reversing the symptoms of low blood glucose. Exogenous glucagon is typically used by family or friends to treat a severe hypoglycemic episode in a person who is unable to take sugar by mouth. Traditional glucagon kits contain a syringe and a vial of glucagon either in a stabilized solution or requiring reconstitution prior to use. Intranasal glucagon is now available as a single-dose, dry-powder device that can be administered to a person whether they are conscious or not. Coordinated inhalation is not required, and its effect is not impacted by the use of medications or congestion.​[^[40]] Intranasal glucagon preparations result in faster use and fewer failures than injectable preparations. Medical attention should be sought for patients not recovering after a few minutes.

Filling new and refill prescriptions for diabetes medications is a convenient opportunity to ask patients if they are using and/or require the following diabetes supplies:
