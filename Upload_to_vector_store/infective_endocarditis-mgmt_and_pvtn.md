#### Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infection of the cardiac endothelium associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs as a result of a combination of injury or trauma to the cardiac endothelial surface (e.g., turbulent blood flow, congenital cardiac abnormalities, IV catheter or foreign particulate matter), fibrin deposition and bacterial adherence. Infective endocarditis may involve the heart valves and surrounding tissues on either the left or right side of the heart, although bilateral involvement has been described. Metastatic infection to extracardiac sites may occur. Complications include heart failure, periannular abscess, mycotic aneurysm and glomerulonephritis. Emboli to extracardiac sites such as the brain, lung or kidney may also occur. 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

The modified Duke criteria (last updated in 2000) are widely accepted as the clinical standard for determining the likelihood of IE.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] The criteria are used to classify IE cases as definite, probable or rejected based on pathologic, clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings (see Table 1 and Table 2).​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Due to the heterogeneous nature of IE, clinical judgment should be used in conjunction with the modified Duke criteria.​[^[2]]



In 2023, the International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) proposed modifications to the 2000 modified Duke criteria.​[^[5]] Highlights of the proposed Duke-ISCVID changes include clarification of IE definitions and changes to the major and minor criteria (including additional of pathogens, blood sampling, radiologic and microbiologic tests, IE history and presence of cardiac devices).​[^[5]] The goal of these changes per the authorship group was to stimulate and encourage further research.​[^[5]] The proposed changes were based on expert opinion of published studies over the last 2 decades.​[^[6]] Post publication, several retrospective studies assessed the ISCVID criteria, finding increased sensitivity but decreased specificity compared to previous versions of the Duke criteria.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]] Other studies have suggested the ISCVID criteria could be improved with revisions.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] Further studies may be warranted to elucidate possible refinements to the criteria before full adoption.​[^[13]]

#### Treatment of Infective Endocarditis

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Surgical Intervention

Surgery is indicated for patients with life-threatening heart failure secondary to valvular damage (regurgitation or stenosis) due to IE.​[^[1]]​[^[14]] Other indications for surgical intervention include persistent emboli, embolic complication, large vegetation (>10 mm), failure of adequate antimicrobial treatment to control infection, severe valvular failure (abscess, dehiscence, perforation or rupture) or evidence of extension into surrounding cardiac tissues or relapsing infection.​[^[1]]​[^[14]] The timing for the surgery should be chosen in consultation with the cardiothoracic surgeon. Early transfer to a cardiovascular surgery centre should be considered if not an option at the current hospital.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

IV antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis is described in Table 9.

#### Pathogens and Considerations for Treatment

The Gram-positive bacteria staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci account for the majority of pathogens causing IE.​[^[15]] Other bacterial pathogens include Gram-negative bacteria. Selection of an antibiotic regimen is based on patient risk factors and adherence, left- versus right-sided IE, native versus prosthetic valve, cultures and antibiotic sensitivities, and likelihood of antibiotic resistance. Prosthetic valve involvement or disseminated infection requires combination regimens with an extended duration of treatment.

#### Staphylococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for staphylococcal endocarditis can be found in Table 3. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains, or coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis) may occur in both native and prosthetic valve IE and together account for approximately 40% of cases of IE.

| IE Type | Suggested Regimen(s) | Duration​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Staphylococci—Native (No Prosthetic Material) |  |  |  |
| MSSA | **cefazolin** | 6 wk | May use 2‑wk treatment if the infective endocarditis is right-sided and uncomplicated (no renal impairment, no extracardiac metastatic infection).​[1]In patients with a beta-lactam type-1 hypersensitivity reaction, consider beta-lactam desensitization; cefazolin may be considered in patients with well-defined non-anaphylactic reaction to penicillin class antibiotics; alternatively, vancomycin or daptomycin​[b] may be used.Gentamicin is no longer recommended for staphylococcal native valve IE due to concerns with toxicity and lack of supporting data.​[1]​[16]​[17]​[18]​[19] |
| MRSA | Vancomycin | 6 wk | Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​[c] |
| or |  |  |  |
| Daptomycin​[b] | 6 wk | Daptomycin should be used in select patients only.​[b] The optimal dosing of daptomycin has not been established. |  |
| Staphylococci—Prosthetic Valve |  |  |  |
| MSSA | **rifampin** | ≥6 wkFirst 2 wk | Cefazolin may be used in place of cloxacillin.In patients with a beta-lactam type-1 hypersensitivity reaction, consider beta-lactam desensitization; cefazolin may be considered in patients with well-defined non-anaphylactic to penicillin class antibiotics; alternatively, cloxacillin may be replaced by vancomycin. |
| MRSA | Vancomycin + rifampin+ gentamicin​[d] | ≥6 wkFirst 2 wk | Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​[c] |


infective endocarditis

#### Streptococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for streptococcal endocarditis can be found in Table 4.

Alpha-hemolytic or viridans streptococci account for 20% of IE cases.​[^[15]] Viridans streptococci include S. mutans, S. oralis (mitis), S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and Gemella morbillorum (formerly called S. morbillorum), S. anginosus group (S. anginosus, *constellatus* and *intermedius*) and S. gallolyticus (formerly called S. bovis).​[^[1]] Other viridans streptococci include Abiotrophia defectiva and Granulicatella spp.

Most streptococci are sensitive to penicillin; however, tolerance or resistance to penicillin has been reported.​[^[1]]​[^[25]] Infective endocarditis due to A. defectiva, Granulicatella spp. or viridans streptococci with MIC >0.5 mg/L may be difficult to cure and should be treated with antibiotic regimens used for enterococcal IE (see Table 5).

| IE Type | Suggested Regimen(s) | Duration​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native Valve | Viridans Group Streptococci and S. gallolyticus (bovis) Sensitive to Penicillin (MIC ≤0.12 mg/L) |  |  |
| **ceftriaxone** | 4 wk | Ampicillin may be used in place of penicillin G. |  |
| or |  |  |  |
| **gentamicin** | 2 wk | Do not use short-course treatment (2 wk) in IE cases with cardiac or extra-cardiac abscesses. |  |
| or |  |  |  |
| Vancomycin | 4 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​[c]​[d] |  |
| Viridans Group Streptococci and S. gallolyticus (bovis) Relatively Resistant to Penicillin (MIC >0.12–≤0.5 mg/L) |  |  |  |
| Penicillin G | 4 wk | Ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be used in place of penicillin G. |  |
| + gentamicin​[b] | First 2 wk |  |  |
| or |  |  |  |
| Vancomycin | 4 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. Vancomycin trough concentrations of 10–15 mg/L suggested.​[c]​[d] |  |

#### Enterococci

Antibiotic treatment regimens for enterococcal endocarditis can be found in Table 5. Choice and duration of the antibiotic regimen depends on the enterococcal spp. and its penicillin or vancomycin susceptibility and/or the presence of high-level gentamicin resistance. Patients with enterococcal IE generally require 4–6 weeks of concomitant beta-lactam and aminoglycoside therapy. Enterococci (e.g., E. faecalis, E. faecium) account for approximately 10% of IE cases.​[^[15]] Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal endocarditis is uncommon. 

| Regimen(s) | Duration​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive to Penicillin, Gentamicin and Vancomycin |  |  |
| **penicillin G** | 4–6 wk | Native valve: 4-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms of illness <3 months; 6-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms >3 months.Prosthetic valve: 6-wk therapy recommended. |
| or |  |  |
| **ceftriaxone** | 6 wk | Recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute (pre-existing or developing during treatment with a gentamicin-containing regimen). |
| or |  |  |
| Vancomycin​[c]​[d] + gentamicin​[b] | 6 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. |
| Sensitive to Penicillin, Streptomycin and Vancomycin and Resistant to Gentamicin |  |  |
| Ampicillin + ceftriaxone | 6 wk |  |
| or |  |  |
| **streptomycin** | 4–6 wk | Native valve: 4-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms of illness <3 months; 6-wk therapy recommended for patients with symptoms >3 months.Prosthetic valve: 6-wk therapy recommended. |
| or |  |  |
| Vancomycin​[c]​[d] + streptomycin | 6 wk | Vancomycin reserved for patients with a beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction. |
| Sensitive to Aminoglycosides and Vancomycin, Resistant to Penicillin |  |  |
| Vancomycin​[c]​[d] + gentamicin​[b] | 6 wk |  |
| Resistant to Aminoglycosides, Penicillin and Vancomycin |  |  |
| **daptomycin** | ≥6 wk | Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal IE may be difficult and is not clearly defined. Various combination regimens including those with daptomycin​[e] have been suggested, although clinical data remain limited.​[1]​[26] The optimal dosing of daptomycin has not been established. |


#### Gram-Negative Bacteria

 Infective endocarditis due to Gram-negative bacteria may account for 2% of cases.​[^[15]] Identification of the Gram-negative pathogen and susceptibility to antibiotics is important in determining the antibiotic regimen and course. Gram-negative bacteria may be divided into HACEK and non-HACEK group bacteria.

HACEK group organisms are fastidious, slow growing, Gram-negative bacilli that account for approximately 1–2% of IE. HACEK group pathogens include Haemophilus spp. (e.g., H. parainfluenzae), Aggregatibacter spp. (e.g., A. actinomycetemcomitans or A. aphrophilus), Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella spp.​[^[1]]

When treating HACEK IE, third-generation or higher cephalosporins may be used; however, due to concerns with beta-lactamase production among HACEK strains, ampicillin is *not* recommended. In patients with beta-lactam allergies, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are alternatives. In certain cases where drug-resistance has been demonstrated, carbapenems may be used (e.g., meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin); however, these agents should only be used in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

#### Culture-Negative IE

Blood cultures may remain negative in 8% of cases despite radiologic and clinical evidence of IE. Reasons for this may include administration of antibiotic therapy prior to cultures and difficult-to-grow pathogens (e.g., Coxiella burnetii or Bartonella spp.), and nonbacterial or unusual pathogens. Conduct a thorough review of the patient host factors (e.g., immunosuppression, burn), comorbidities (e.g., diabetes), history of IV drug use, animal or insect exposure, indwelling devices, prior surgical procedures, or other possible etiologic causes of culture-negative IE. Histopathology of cardiac tissue may aid in the identification of potential pathogens.​[^[27]] Serologic and molecular diagnostics may be used to identify pathogens such as C. burnetii, Bartonella, Tropheryma whipplei or Chlamydia spp.​[^[1]] Select antibiotic therapy based on the most likely pathogen after a review of available patient data. Consult with an infectious disease specialist and clinical microbiologist.

#### Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy of IE

Although outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been used to treat IE, consider stringent entry criteria and close patient follow-up for patients receiving OPAT.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] In uncomplicated IE patients, OPAT may be used to complete a 4- to 6-week total treatment course, providing proper patient assessment and follow-up is conducted. In general, eligible patients should have received an initial 2 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy administered as an inpatient before initiation of OPAT.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Monitor patients for clinical response, complications and adverse drug effects from antibiotic therapy (e.g., resulting from prolonged aminoglycoside therapy). OPAT may also be used to treat patients who inject drugs (PWID).​[^[30]] However, barriers such as low patient acceptance, treatment bias, or availability of support programs or harm reduction programs may limit the broad use of OPAT among the PWID population.​[^[30]]

#### Intravenous to Oral Antibiotic Therapy of IE

For most patients, IV antibiotics are administered for the entire IE treatment course; however, a 2019 study from Denmark found that patients who received IV antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics to complete the treatment course had similar outcomes to those who received IV therapy for the entire course of treatment.​[^[31]] At the 6-month follow-up date, stable patients with left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp., E. faecalis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci who were converted to oral combination therapy halfway through their treatment course (median of switch to oral antibiotics: 17 days) had similar outcomes to the IV-only antibiotic group.​[^[32]] One limitation of the study was the use of antibiotic combinations that are not commonly used in Canada (e.g., linezolid/moxifloxacin plus rifampin/fusidic acid) or not available (fusidic acid);​[^[32]] this will limit applicability.

A 2023 retrospective study found that outcomes among 46 IE patients transitioned from IV to oral antibiotics were similar to patients receiving IV antibiotics only.​[^[33]] Depending on the pathogen, a variety of high-dose antibiotics were used.​[^[33]]

Oral transition therapy may not be appropriate for all patients with IE. Research pertaining to factors contributing to success or failure with oral transitional therapy is needed.​[^[34]] Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is encouraged in all cases where this conversion to oral therapy is being considered.

#### Prevention of Infective Endocarditis

#### Managing At-Risk Patients

Concerns about bacteremia and severity of IE led to a consensus among experts over the past 50 years to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with risk factors undergoing procedures known to cause bacteremia.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]] Assumptions were made that antibiotic prophylaxis would prevent IE in patients undergoing dental, GI and genitourinary tract procedures; however, there is an absence of randomized controlled trials documenting the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing IE. Most cases of IE cannot be attributed to invasive procedures. Systematic reviews did not find supportive data.​[^[39]]​[^[40]] The benefit of widespread antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE is small.​[^[41]] As a result, revised recommendations limit antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk of adverse outcome from IE (see Table 6).​[^[37]]​[^[38]] A recent review of studies published before and after the 2007 revision in antibiotic prophylaxis protocol did not find evidence of an increase in viridans group streptococci IE.​[^[37]]

Antibiotic prophylaxis is directed against viridans group streptococci for patients with underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk of adverse outcomes (see Table 6) undergoing procedures outlined in Table 7. Administer the antibiotic to provide effective serum concentrations at the time of the anticipated bacteremia and for a few hours thereafter.

In a recent review of IE antibiotic prophylaxis, clindamycin was found to be associated with higher incidence of nonfatal and fatal adverse events related to Clostridioides difficile infection.​[^[42]] As a result, clindamycin is no longer recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis in dental procedures. As an alternative, doxycycline may be prescribed in those who cannot tolerate penicillins, cephalosporins or macrolides.​[^[37]]

If the antibiotic is inadvertently not administered before the procedure, the dose may be administered up to 2 hours after the procedure. This should be reserved only for those patients who did not receive a dose prior to the procedure.

If the patient is already taking an antibiotic that would be used for endocarditis prophylaxis, select an agent from a different class to avoid encountering resistant strains.​[^[37]] Alternatively, delay the procedure until 10 days or more after completion of the antibiotic course to allow the bacterial flora to return to its usual state.​[^[37]]

Increased risk of respiratory depression with neuromuscular blocking agents. | Consider avoiding gentamicin-containing regimen in older patients or those at risk of aminoglycoside toxicity. Toxicity risk may increase with prolonged administration and/or concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins.Monitor renal function and serum gentamicin concentrations, especially for prolonged courses. Consider maintaining gentamicin trough concentrations ≤1 mg/L to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity.For enterococcal IE only, gentamicin peak and trough levels of 3–4 mg/L and <1 mg/L, respectively, may be considered. |
| **streptomycin** (generics) | 7.5 mg/kg Q12H IV/IM | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity. | Enhanced effects with concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins, e.g., amphotericin B, vancomycin. Increased risk of respiratory depression with neuromuscular blocking agents. | Serum concentration assay not commonly available.Toxicity risk may increase with prolonged administration and/or concomitant nephrotoxins or ototoxins. |
| **cefazolin** (generics) | 2 g Q8H IV | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, diarrhea. | Possible increased INR with warfarin. |  |
| **ceftriaxone** (generics) | 2 g Q24H IVFor Enterococcus faecalis IE, 2 g Q12H IV, combined with ampicillin | Rash, hypersensitivity, drug fever, diarrhea, elevated AST and/or ALT, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis. | Possible increased INR with warfarin.Ceftriaxone binds with IV calcium salts to form an insoluble precipitate. |  |
| **vancomycin** (generics) | 15 mg/kg Q12H IV (see Comments) | Thrombophlebitis, rash, fever, anemia, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, vancomycin flushing syndrome. | Increased incidence of nephrotoxicity when used with aminoglycosides. | Monitor vancomycin troughs to maintain concentrations 10–15 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus IE.​[1]​[21] There is no recommended therapeutic range for vancomycin against non-MRSA pathogens (e.g., Enterococcus or Streptococcus spp.); however, MRSA therapeutic ranges are often used for these pathogens.Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been reported with higher dosages and vancomycin troughs >15 mg/L.In some institutions, vancomycin AUC0–24 h/MIC (range 400–600 mg*h/L) may be calculated with vancomycin trough(s) with/without vancomycin peak(s);​[21] consult institutions’ vancomycin dosing protocols, if available. There is increasing evidence that vancomycin troughs of 10-15 mg/L correlate with AUC0-24h/MIC of 400-600. ​[21] |
| **daptomycin** (Cubicin, generics) | 6 mg/kg Q24H IV | Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, thrombophlebitis, injection site pain/reaction, anemia, creatinine kinase elevation, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis. | Consider avoiding concomitant HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor administration as a precaution as daptomycin may increase its levels. | Monitor creatinine kinase weekly at minimum, especially in patients with renal impairment and/or HMG-CoA reductase co-administration.Some experts suggest ≥8 mg/kg Q24H IV for IE. Consider consultation with an infectious diseases specialist.Reserved for cases with established resistance or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies. |
| **linezolid** (Zyvoxam, generics) | 600 mg Q12H IV/PO | Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia. | MAOI, therefore use caution; evaluate concomitant agents for potential interaction; avoid tyramine-rich foods. | Monitor CBC weekly.Reserved for cases with established resistance or if use of other appropriate agent(s) is contraindicated. Consult local antimicrobial stewardship policies. |
