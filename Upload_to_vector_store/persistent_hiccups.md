#### Introduction

Persistent (2â€“30 days) or intractable (>1 month) hiccups are unusual but distressing. They may cause insomnia, weight loss or depression and may be associated with metabolic causes, upper respiratory tract infections such as COVID-19, and abnormalities of the CNS, ear, throat, diaphragm, thorax or abdomen.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]] Persistent/intractable hiccups occur predominantly in older males. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients.*)

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



If all investigations are negative or etiologic treatment is impossible, a therapeutic trial to stop the hiccups is warranted.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 1 details some of the medications and doses used in the management of persistent or intractable hiccups.

There is currently not enough evidence to recommend any single therapy over another, as most studies involve case reports or case series in small numbers of patients; only baclofen and metoclopramide have been studied in randomized controlled trials. Often patients will fail multiple therapies before a successful regimen is found.

If chronic therapy is required, titrate the dose downward to find the lowest effective dose taken once daily.

#### Dopamine Antagonists

Historically, chlorpromazine has been tried for the treatment of persistent hiccups.â€‹[^[9]] Haloperidol has also been effective in some cases.â€‹[^[10]] Metoclopramide was moderately effective in a small randomized placebo-controlled trial;â€‹[^[12]] it may act as a dopamine antagonist or by enhancing gastric emptying. A protocol for a systematic review of metoclopramide in persistent hiccups was recently published. The results are pending but may provide more robust evidence regarding the use of metoclopramide.â€‹[^[11]] 

#### Muscle Relaxants

Baclofen has been studied in 2 randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials and found to be more effective than placebo for intractable hiccups.â€‹[^[13]]â€‹[^[14]] In a case series, maintenance therapy was required in at least 50% of cases.â€‹[^[15]] If effective, baclofen should not be discontinued suddenly; taper gradually until the minimum maintenance dose is determined.

Since baclofen is excreted by the kidney, much lower doses are required in the presence of renal failure; neurotoxicity has been reported in patients with renal failure.â€‹[^[16]]

#### Other Drugs

In case reports or case series, many other drugs such as amantadine,â€‹[^[17]] amitriptyline,â€‹[^[18]] carbamazepine,â€‹[^[19]] gabapentin,â€‹[^[20]] nifedipineâ€‹[^[21]] and valproic acidâ€‹[^[22]] have been found to be effective in some patients.

Avoid benzodiazepines, as worsening of hiccups has been reported.

#### Duration of Treatment

With an effective drug, hiccups generally stop abruptly within a few hours; in some cases, the frequency and severity may slowly decrease over days.

When a drug is deemed effective, taper the dose downward after 1â€“3 days. If hiccups do not return, the drug can be tapered and stopped. If hiccups return, find the lowest dose that will suppress them; maintenance therapy may be required in some cases.

When a drug is ineffective, there is no need to continue treatment for more than 3 days.

#### Drug Table

**Drug Class: Muscle Relaxants**

| Drug/â€‹Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **chlorpromazine** (generics) | 25â€“50 mg TIDâ€“QID PO Ã— 2â€“3 days | Anticholinergic effects, extrapyramidal effects, hypotension, sedation, seizure, weight gain, photosensitivity, QTc prolongation. | Additive sedative effects with CNS depressants, including alcohol. | If deemed ineffective, stop after 2â€“3 days.If deemed effective, taper gradually (e.g., every 1â€“3 days). If hiccups return, find the lowest dose that will suppress them. Maintenance therapy may be required in some cases; taper dose to lowest effective dose (given once daily). |

If hiccups return, find the lowest dose that will suppress them. Maintenance therapy may be required in some cases; taper dose to lowest effective dose (given once daily). |
| **baclofen** (generics) | Start with 5 mg BID PO; increase gradually every 2â€“3 days; maximum 80 mg/day | Sedation, muscle weakness, nausea, dizziness, lowered seizure threshold.Reports of neurotoxicity in patients with reduced renal function; use decreased dose, e.g., 2.5 mg BID. | Additive sedative effects with CNS depressants, including alcohol. | If deemed ineffective, stop after 2â€“3 days.If deemed effective, taper gradually (e.g., every 1â€“3 days). If hiccups return, find the lowest dose that will suppress them. Maintenance therapy may be required in some cases; taper dose to lowest effective dose (given once daily). |
