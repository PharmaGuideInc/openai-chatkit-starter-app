CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women” and “men” as well as “female” and “male” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. 

#### Introduction

*Ventricular tachycardia* (VT) is usually defined as ≥3 consecutive ventricular complexes at a rate >100 bpm on an ECG recording. VT can be a clinically unimportant, asymptomatic event or a life-threatening arrhythmia. *Ventricular fibrillation* (VF) is defined as a rapid, disorganized rhythm without recognizable QRS complexes on the ECG. VF is invariably associated with cardiovascular collapse and is almost always fatal unless the patient is electrically defibrillated.

This chapter describes a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients with documented VF, VT or cardiac arrest. Medication-induced QT prolongation is also reviewed.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



In some patients, the documented arrhythmia is a wide-complex tachycardia, and it may not be clear if this represents VT or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. All wide-complex tachycardias (QRS duration ≥0.12 s) in patients over 50 years of age should be considered VT until proven otherwise. Wide-complex tachycardia in an older patient with a history of heart disease is almost always VT, regardless of the morphology of ECG complexes. Most wide-complex tachycardias in any patient of any age group are due to VT.

#### Significance of VT/VF

The clinical and prognostic importance and management of VT depends on whether it is sustained or nonsustained and whether there is associated structural heart disease, particularly left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Asymptomatic: Asymptomatic VT usually consists of nonsustained short episodes (3–10 beats). It is often discovered during routine screening ECG or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In the absence of structural heart disease, nonsustained VT is associated with a very low risk of significant cardiac events or subsequent sustained VT. In the presence of structural heart disease, especially left ventricular dysfunction, asymptomatic VT (usually nonsustained) may indicate a risk of future serious, symptomatic, sustained VT or VF.​[^[1]]

Symptomatic: Symptoms may include palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, presyncope, loss of consciousness or cardiac arrest. The severity of symptoms does not determine the prognostic importance of VT and its management, e.g., even severe symptoms in a patient with nonsustained VT and no structural heart disease are prognostically benign; such patients require reassurance, but not necessarily specific antiarrhythmic therapy.​[^[1]]

Cardiac arrest: Most episodes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are likely the result of VF, although the initial cardiac rhythm documented by first responders is often asystole. VF almost always leads to cardiac arrest, whereas sustained VT may lead to collapse or cardiac arrest after a variable duration, usually 1 to several minutes. 

Sustained VT: Lasts ≥30 seconds or requires immediate medical intervention. For management decisions, >15 seconds is a reasonable working definition. It is most often associated with structural heart disease, typically coronary disease with previous MI. Sustained VT with structural heart disease requires investigation and therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs, an implanted cardioverter defibrillator or radiofrequency ablation. Sustained VT with no structural heart disease (idiopathic VT) usually requires therapy if symptomatic or if polymorphic. Treatment of asymptomatic VT in someone with no structural heart disease is individualized. Totally asymptomatic short salvos of VT may not need any treatment; however, in sustained VT, even in the absence of symptoms, careful evaluation is required and treatment may be indicated.

Nonsustained VT: Lasts <30 seconds, usually only a few seconds. Most commonly there are <10 consecutive ventricular complexes. Unless symptomatic, it requires treatment only if the likelihood of subsequent sustained VT or cardiac arrest is high, e.g., ejection fraction <35% or associated with marked QT prolongation.

VT associated with structural heart disease (e.g., coronary, valvular or hypertensive heart disease): Usually symptomatic and associated with a high risk of sudden death or recurrence (if sustained) or asymptomatic and associated with at least a moderate risk of sudden death (if nonsustained). The magnitude of left ventricular dysfunction is the most important prognostic factor.

VT associated with a structurally normal heart: May be symptomatic but rarely is life-threatening, even if sustained; it requires no therapy if asymptomatic and nonsustained.​[^[1]]

Monomorphic VT: Usually implies an abnormal automatic focus in the ventricle or a fixed re-entrant pathway associated with a scar. It does not by itself suggest prognosis or therapy and in a structurally normal heart does not necessarily require treatment. 

Polymorphic VT: Usually presents as polymorphic VT between 3–20 beats, often in repetitive salvos. Consider myocardial ischemia and abnormalities of repolarization (torsades de pointes: VT associated with QTc prolongation and a characteristic long-short initiating sequence).​[^[1]] Polymorphic VT, especially if occurring with exercise, in the presence of structural disease, or with QT prolongation, often implies a high risk of sustained VT or cardiac arrest and requires careful investigation.

Ventricular fibrillation: Most patients with VF are at high risk of recurrence. These individuals should be investigated in a similar fashion to patients with sustained VT and should be treated to prevent recurrences.​[^[1]] The most common underlying cause is coronary artery disease (CAD), often with prior MI, with or without acute ischemia or infarction. VF may complicate acute MI; however, the prognosis for resuscitated patients with VF occurring during the first 48 hours post-MI is similar to that in patients with an infarction of equivalent severity uncomplicated by VF. 

#### Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Arrhythmia Risk

#### QT Interval and Risk of Arrhythmia

QT interval is defined on surface ECG as the interval between initiation of QRS complex and the termination of T wave. This interval is composed of the time from beginning of ventricular muscle contraction to the end of its relaxation. It is used as a surrogate for cardiac muscle repolarization time. 

QT interval seems simple to measure, but in practice, accurate measurement of QT can be an intricate task. QRS prolongation, variability of QT interval in different ECG leads (spatial QT dispersion), ambiguity in the terminal part of T wave, biphasic or bifid T waves, merging of the final part of T wave with the subsequent P wave, and presence of a U wave are all circumstances that add to the complexity of this apparently simple measurement. It is therefore not surprising that significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability of QT measurement, even between experts, have been reported.​[^[2]]

The QT interval is not constant for a given individual. It changes dynamically under the influence of numerous factors like body position, sleep, autonomic tone and electrolyte balance. Heart rate is the factor with the most influence on QT interval. QT interval lengthens with decreasing heart rate and shortens as heart rate increases. Multiple formulae have been developed to account for these rate-related changes and reveal the “time invariant” underlying QT interval. Although not perfectly accurate, one of the most commonly used QT correction methods in clinical practice is Bazett formula (Table 1). The resulting “corrected” QT is called the QTc. Bazett formula undercorrects at fast heart rates (e.g., >100/min); as a result a QTc >480 msec may be seen with normal repolarization at fast heart rates. 

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corrected QT (QTc) | = | QT interval in seconds |
| √R-R interval in seconds |  |  |


The American Heart Association defines a prolonged QTc interval as ≥470 milliseconds in men and ≥480 milliseconds in women.​[^[3]] 

Prolongation of repolarization time and its dispersion in different parts of the heart increase the likelihood of initiation and perpetuation of a particular kind of ventricular arrhythmia, a form of polymorphic VT called torsades de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually a self-limiting tachycardia, but it can last long enough to cause hemodynamic instability or degenerate into VF and cause sudden cardiac death.

The risk of TdP increases proportionally, but not in a linear relationship, with prolongation of QTc. It is of greatest concern when QTc is greater than 500 milliseconds or when the QTc increases more than 60 milliseconds from the baseline value.

QT prolongation can be congenital. Pathogenic variants of multiple genes, encoding cardiac ion channels, have been identified to affect QT interval and cause congenital long QT (LQT) syndromes. Patients with congenital LQT may suffer ventricular arrhythmias, syncope or, more rarely, sudden death. Patients with congenital LQT syndrome should avoid QT-prolonging drugs throughout their lives. Moreover, some non-QT-prolonging medications can increase the risk of adverse cardiac events in these patients. For example, Na-channel blocking antiseizure medications are not classified as QT-prolonging drugs; however, they increase risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with type 2 but not type 1 LQT syndrome.​[^[4]]

Acquired conditions can be responsible for lengthening of QT interval. These conditions include bradycardia, especially complete heart block, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), hypothermia, hypothyroidism, toxins such as organophosphates, intracranial pathologies, myocardial ischemia and HIV infection. 

#### Medications and QT Prolongation

Medications are the most common cause of QT prolongation. Both antiarrhythmic and noncardiac medications can prolong the QT interval. Most do so by acting on a repolarizing potassium channel called IKr. An updated list of QT-prolonging drugs is available from CredibleMeds.

The major classes of medications that cause QT prolongation are listed in Table 2.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Class | Drug |
| Antiarrhythmics | Amiodarone, disopyramide, flecainide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol (see text for further discussion of antiarrhythmic drugs) |
| Antibiotics (quinolone, macrolide) | Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin |
| Antidepressants | Citalopram, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline)​[a] |
| Antiemetics | Domperidone, ondansetron |
| Antifungals (azole) | Fluconazole, itraconazole |
| Antihistamines | Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine​[b] |
| Antipsychotics | Typical (e.g., haloperidol, thioridazine) and atypical (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) agents |
| Chemotherapy agents | Oxaliplatin,​[c] small molecule inhibitors (e.g., arsenic trioxide, CKD4/6 inhibitors, panobinostat, tyrosine kinase inhibitors​[7]) |
| General anesthetics | Propofol, sevoflurane |
| Opioid analgesic | Methadone |




Most medications that prolong the QT interval and with a proven risk of TdP rarely lead to arrhythmias. The excess risk of most noncardiac drugs that prolong the QT is much less than 1/1000 patient years.​[^[8]] This association may not be entirely due to the drugs but may be a reflection of the underlying illness being treated. 

The risk of serious proarrhythmia with any noncardiac QT-prolonging drug is very low unless the QT interval is greater than 500–520 milliseconds (uncorrected).​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]] 

The extent of QT prolongation and the probability of TdP depends on patient risk factors. The most common added risk factors are female sex, older age, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, higher drug dosage, concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications, and medical conditions that can affect drug metabolism.​[^[12]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]] These possible risk factors are presented in Table 3.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patient Related | Medical Conditions | Drug Related |
| Age >67 y | Anorexia nervosa, hypothyroidism, starvation | Altered drug metabolism, e.g., renal or liver failure |
| Bradycardia (heart rate <45 beats/min) | Congenital long QT syndrome | Loop diuretics |
| Female sex | Electrolyte disturbances including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia |  |
| First 24 h after cardiac arrest, syncope or seizure | Family history of sudden cardiac death |  |
| First 7 days after acute coronary syndrome | Heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) |  |
| First 7 days after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm | Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |  |
| First 7 days after stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage or head trauma | Hypoglycemia (documented and in absence of diabetes) |  |
|  | Pheochromocytoma |  |
|  | Sepsis |  |


#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Immediate Therapy for Sustained VT or VF

If a patient with sustained monomorphic VT is unstable (e.g., has hypotension, angina, heart failure or marked symptoms), cardioversion is effective and safe.​[^[1]]​[^[15]] A synchronized biphasic shock is usually effective for VT. If immediate conversion to sinus rhythm is not considered necessary, antiarrhythmic drug therapy can be given.​[^[15]]

For polymorphic VT or VF, an immediate nonsynchronized shock is required; repeat every 2 minutes if necessary (with minimum interruptions in CPR), increasing shock energy if shocks fail (if possible), until defibrillation is achieved.

#### Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT or VF Recurrence

Therapeutic choices for long-term management of sustained VT or VF (see Figure 1, Figure 2) include both drug therapy (see Table 4) and nondrug therapy (implanted cardioverter defibrillator, catheter ablation, map-guided endocardial resection, stereotactic cardiac radioablation).​[^[1]]

An implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is very effective in terminating episodes of VT or VF.​[^[1]] Current guidelines recommend an ICD as preferred treatment in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, VF or sustained VT not due to a reversible cause.​[^[1]]​[^[16]] Multiple studies have demonstrated the mortality benefit of ICDs in these patients. The AVID trial reported a 39% reduction in total mortality after 1 year in ICD-treated patients relative to antiarrhythmic therapy (primarily amiodarone).​[^[17]]

Although ICDs are effective in terminating episodes of VT, they do not provide long-term prevention of recurrent arrhythmias. Consequently, alternative interventions such as catheter ablation or pharmacotherapy (see Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT/VF Recurrence) remain central to the management strategy for preventing subsequent VT episodes in this group of patients.

Catheter ablation is considered first-line therapy for patients with structurally normal hearts​[^[1]] and, in addition to beta-blocker therapy, for selected patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.​[^[18]] Success is generally highest in patients with hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT and those with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction.​[^[19]]

Compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation:



Another approach to reducing the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia in selected patients with structural heart disease is stereotactic cardiac radioablation. This technique remains largely investigational and is not widely available. It is typically reserved as a last resort for patients whose ventricular tachycardia is refractory to other treatment options.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Immediate Therapy for Sustained VT or VF

Amiodarone**:** IV amiodarone is moderately, but rarely immediately, effective in terminating VT and is especially effective in preventing early recurrence. It is likely the most effective therapy for electrical storm (characterized by frequent recurrences of VT/VF) and is probably useful in shock-resistant VF.​[^[1]]​[^[15]] There are few randomized studies to guide dosing. The dose recommended in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) guidelines is a 300 mg IV bolus followed by a 150 mg IV bolus, if required.​[^[15]]​[^[22]] Alternatively, 3–5 mg/kg IV over 5–10 minutes followed by a 0.5–1 mg/minute infusion can be used. The product monograph recommends 150 mg IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 mg/minute for 6 hours then 0.5 mg/minute for 18 hours.​[^[23]] If necessary, an ongoing infusion of 0.5–1 mg/min can be continued for 24–48 hours. Hypotension may occur, especially if the drug is administered very rapidly. Administration through a central line, if possible, can avoid the development of phlebitis.

Procainamide**:** 10–15 mg/kg IV over 30–45 minutes will often slow VT and terminate tachycardia. It is indicated for monomorphic VT, not polymorphic VT. Hypotension may occur, especially at more rapid infusion rates, and BP should be carefully monitored.​[^[15]]

Magnesium**:** 2–5 g IV over 3–5 minutes is the treatment of choice for torsades de pointes VT and may be useful in the presence of myocardial ischemia. It is probably of no benefit in monomorphic VT.​[^[1]] Magnesium is generally safe, but may rarely cause hypotension.

Beta1-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers): IV beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, propranolol, esmolol) can prevent VT or VF in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia, recent MI or electrical storm​[^[1]]. Bradycardia or hypotension may occur. There is some evidence that during electrical storm, propranolol is superior to metoprolol.​[^[24]] 

Lidocaine**:** 1–1.5 mg/kg IV followed by a 1–3 mg/minute infusion is occasionally effective (in <20% of cases of sustained monomorphic VT).​[^[1]] If conversion does not occur within 10–15 minutes, lidocaine will probably not be effective. Results of a large, randomized controlled trial suggests it may increase the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in shock-resistant VF.​[^[22]] Lidocaine rarely causes hypotension, and at high doses can cause CNS adverse events.

#### Chronic Therapy—Prevention of VT/VF Recurrence

Sustained monomorphic VT/VF is likely to recur in the absence of treatment. Objective documentation of treatment efficacy (e.g., electrophysiologic testing or reduction of VT episodes on Holter monitoring) can be considered. In patients with LV dysfunction, drug therapy should rarely be used as the only therapy for the prevention of recurrent sustained VT (secondary prevention) or prevention of first occurrence of VT in at-risk patients (primary prophylaxis). ICD implantation is superior to drug therapy in this setting.​[^[1]]

Indicators that have been used historically to assess efficacy of drugs in individual patients include the ability to prevent induction of VT during an electrophysiologic study or with exercise, and elimination or marked reduction in the frequency of nonsustained VT episodes or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Such assessment of drug efficacy is of uncertain usefulness and currently rarely performed.

Patients with a history of VF or cardiac arrest are usually at high risk (20–30% per year) of recurrence of VF or VT, since their original arrhythmia may have been VT degenerating to VF. Their treatment is similar to that of patients with sustained VT, although markers to judge drug efficacy (inducible VT or VF; nonsustained VT on Holter monitoring) are present less often.

Beta-blockers have been demonstrated to suppress arrhythmias and reduce mortality associated with heart failure or following an MI. If tolerated, they are recommended for all patients in whom drug therapy is to be used.​[^[25]] Consider the presence of other disease states when choosing a beta-blocker​[^[24]] (see Heart Failure and Post-myocardial Infarction). Beta-blockers are particularly useful in patients with exercise-, stress- or ischemia-induced VT. Metoprolol is a reasonable choice in these patients based on clinical experience. Atenolol and bisoprolol are also frequently used, and their longer half-lives allow once-daily dosing. Doses used are based on large studies in post-MI and heart failure patients, and modified based on adverse effects and heart rate at rest and during exercise.

Amiodarone and sotalol are effective in preventing VT or VF, but almost all studies show they are less effective than implanted defibrillators in preventing sudden death and decreasing all-cause mortality in patients at high risk for sustained VT or VF.​[^[26]] No randomized study has shown that antiarrhythmic drugs reduce mortality; however, amiodarone or sotalol can be used as an adjunct to ICD implantation to prevent ICD shocks, which are painful.​[^[27]]

In patients with multiple, frequent recurrences of VT or VF (electrical storm) resistant to the combination of a beta-blocker and amiodarone, or if amiodarone is ineffective or not tolerated, Class I agents such as mexiletine or quinidine can be cautiously added. Such combinations are entirely empiric and should be used only as a last resort.​[^[1]] In highly selected cases, empiric combinations of sotalol and quinidine,​[^[28]] or quinidine and mexiletine,​[^[29]] or other combinations of drugs with Class IA, IB and III activity can be considered. Quinidine is available only through the Health Canada Special Access Program and is rarely used.

#### Therapeutic Approach in a Patient Needing QT-Prolonging Medications

Administration of a single QT-prolonging drug in a patient with no risk factors and short or normal baseline QTc is safe; however, in daily practice, patients with multiple risk factors who need 1 or more QT-prolonging medications are frequently encountered.

Automated decision-support systems have been developed to alert health-care providers to significant QTc prolongation. More data on their effectiveness and impact on overall patient outcomes are needed to justify the cost of implementation of such systems.​[^[14]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

Until development of a practical system with proven benefit, it is prudent to consider a stepwise approach when prescribing 1 or a combination of QT-prolonging drugs for high-risk patients.

A suggested approach in these circumstances includes the following steps:



It is important to remember that using 2 or more QT-prolonging medications, even in high-risk patients, does not necessarily further prolong QT or cause cardiac arrhythmias. Studies that compared effect of mono versus poly QT-prolonging drug therapy on QT interval showed inconsistent results.​[^[37]] In a study of 3442 patients treated with a QT-prolonging antibiotic, another drug known to cause TdP had been coadministered in 1332 patients (38.7%). In this study, 14% of patients were using more than 3 QT-prolonging drugs. Hypokalemia was also documented in 15.9% of these patients. However, no cases of TdP were noted.​[^[38]] Therefore, if indicated, we should not withhold necessary medications based entirely on fear of QT prolongation.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) lasting less than 15 seconds. It is divided into two main branches: Asymptomatic and Symptomatic.

### Asymptomatic Branch:
1. **No Heart Disease, Normal QTc:**
   - Recommendation: No treatment.

2. **QTc Prolongation:**
   - Action: Treat underlying cause, e.g., hypokalemia, drug-induced.

3. **LV Dysfunction in Nonischemic or Valvular Disease:**
   - Optimize LV function (afterload reduction and beta-blocker).
   - No specific antiarrhythmic therapy.

### Symptomatic Branch:
- Divided into two categories: Palpitations and Syncope.

1. **Palpitations:**
   - Same as asymptomatic except:
     - Use beta-blocker if exercise-induced.
     - Use amiodarone if structural heart disease is present.

2. **Syncope:**
   - Consider electrophysiologic study or prolonged ECG monitoring.

3. **LV Dysfunction from CAD with Prior MI:**
   - Use beta-blocker.
   - Consider electrophysiologic study or ICD if VT is inducible or if the ejection fraction is less than 35%.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing nonsustained VT based on symptoms and underlying conditions.

### Main Sections:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Determine if there is a reversible cause or no reversible cause.

2. **Reversible Cause:**
   - **Drug toxicity**

3. **No Reversible Cause:**
   - **Structural Heart Disease (e.g., LV dysfunction):**
     - **Syncope or Cardiac Arrest:**
       - Cardiac catheterization and consider electrophysiologic study.
       - **Treatment:** ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) as primary treatment in most cases. Consider amiodarone or radiofrequency ablation.
     - **No Syncope:**
       - Evaluate LV (Left Ventricular) function.
       - **LVEF ≤ 40%:**

         - **Inducible VT:**
           - Yes: ICD, amiodarone, sotalol, or radiofrequency ablation.
           - No: Consider ischemia if polymorphic and CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) is present. Revascularization if necessary, beta-blocker, amiodarone, or consider ICD.

   - **No Identifiable Structural Heart Disease:**
     - **Exercise-induced:** Use beta-blocker.
     - **Not related to exercise or stress:** Consider electrophysiologic study with a view to ablation.
