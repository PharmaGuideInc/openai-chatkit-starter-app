#### Introduction

Colic, derived from the Greek word “kolikos” or “kolon” and implying a gastrointestinal origin, is described as a functional gastrointestinal disorder of infancy. It is reported in approximately 5–20% of healthy infants, although prevalence is dependent on the definition used, parental/caregiver perception and cultural norms.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] The incidence of colic does not differ by gender, by feeding type or by number of weeks at delivery.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] There is no evidence of a genetic predisposition to colic.​[^[3]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

The most accepted definition of colic uses the ROME IV criteria: an infant less than 5 months of age who experiences recurrent and prolonged episodes of unexplained crying, irritability or fussiness that cannot be resolved or prevented by caregivers and who has no apparent failure to thrive, fever or illness.​[^[1]] Therefore, colic is a diagnosis of exclusion and is considered when other organic causes, including trauma and infection as well as neurologic, metabolic, cardiovascular and GI disorders, have been ruled out.​[^[7]] Historical definitions of colic include Wessel’s rule of threes:​[^[8]] episodes of crying lasting more than 3 hours per day, on at least 3 days per week, for 3 weeks or more. More recently, this definition has fallen out of favour, as it is considered arbitrary, focusing on duration rather than the nature of crying episodes, without accounting for the variable presentations and normal cultural differences in duration reported in the literature.​[^[1]]

Colic is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves by 5 months of age or 5 months after term in premature infants.​[^[7]] It typically presents at around 2 weeks of age, persists until 6 weeks of age and gradually improves thereafter, becoming uncommon after 3–4 months of age.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] A diurnal variation has been observed, with crying more often in the late afternoon or evening.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[11]] Behavioural components of colic, while nondiagnostic and nonspecific, may include flushing, facial expressions suggestive of pain, abdominal distension, flatus and drawing up of the legs over the abdomen.​[^[3]]​[^[12]]

Although the term colic is frequently overused, it is important to consider the potentially serious sequelae for both caregivers and child. Caregivers of babies with colic are often severely distressed; colic increases the risk of abusive head trauma (shaken baby syndrome) and has been associated with postpartum depression.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] Therefore, appropriate attention should be given to both infant and parent/caregiver when managing cases of infant colic.

#### Pathophysiology

The exact etiology of colic is unknown. Proposed causes include organic (neurodevelopmental and gastrointestinal) and psychosocial components (see Table 1).​[^[15]] It is important to remember that a combination of factors is likely implicated in any given infant, underlying the importance of a multi-modal approach to therapy. Some experts believe that colic may best be viewed as a clinical manifestation of normal neurodevelopment, in which a young infant displays reflexive rather than cortical control of behavioural mechanisms such as crying.​[^[9]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

Although not fully understood, an increasing body of literature suggests alterations in the intestinal microbiome may play an important role in colic. Infants with colic display decreased microbial diversity, stability and altered colonization patterns (dysbiosis) compared to infants without colic. In particular, delayed or impaired colonization with *Lactobacillus* spp. after birth characterizes the development of colic.​[^[19]] Increased levels of pathogenic Gram-negative organisms observed in patients with colic may result in increased intestinal inflammation and pain, and the presence of lactose-fermenting organisms may lead to excessive gas production and abdominal distension. Dysbiosis may increase intestinal permeability and subsequently local and systemic inflammation​[^[20]] and alter enteral and central neuronal function, including pain recognition and regulation of crying. Several other mechanisms, including altered gut motility and decreased bile acid production, which are known to occur in neonates and young infants, may also influence the development of colic. More information regarding the pathophysiology of infant colic can be found in the Suggested Readings.

While organic causes likely contribute to the development of colic to some degree, a correlation with familial mental health disorders has also been demonstrated in the literature. It is important to recognize psychosocial contributors, such as those mentioned in Table 1, and to recommend appropriate management strategies or referrals for caregivers.

| Proposed Cause | Possible Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Neurodevelopmental | Immature enteral and central nervous system function, altered endogenous opioid system. |
| Gastrointestinal | Feeding technique, cow’s milk protein intolerance, intestinal gas, lactose intolerance, gastroesophageal reflux, dysmotility, altered intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis), neonatal antibiotic use. |
| Psychosocial | Issues in the breastfeeding person: anxiety disorders, substance abuse (including smoking and nicotine exposure), lack of self-efficacy; depression in a partner; household stress; family dynamics. |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

An assessment algorithm for infants with suspected colic is illustrated in Figure 1. A complete history and physical examination should be performed to rule out any organic causes of crying or underlying medical conditions. The red flag symptoms presented in Table 2 should prompt urgent medical referral.

|  |
| --- |
| Fever (medical emergency in infants <3 months) or lethargy |
| Weight loss, dehydration or failure to thrive |
| Diarrhea, blood-streaked or mucousy stools |
| Frequent regurgitation, vomiting, abdominal distension |
| Extreme or high-pitched crying |
| Parental mood disorders (anxiety or depression) |
| Maternal drug ingestion (illicit or pharmacologic) |
| >5 months of age |
| Lack of predictable diurnal rhythm |
| Family history of migraine or atopy |


Health-care professionals should be aware that excessive infant crying has been associated with an increased risk of physical child abuse. Red flags include history of fall or trauma, infant refusal to move or use limbs, and suspicious bruising. Health-care professionals have a duty to report all suspected cases of child abuse to their provincial department of child and family services.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy is the mainstay of treatment of colic. Since the cause of colic is unknown, there are as many nonpharmacologic treatments as there are proposed etiologies. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of these interventions.​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[17]] Take a holistic approach when advising parents of treatment strategies, and provide information on community support to give parents/caregivers the opportunity to share and consult with others in a similar situation. Reassure caregivers that any given strategy may or may not work and that flexibility is essential to success.

If a series of calming techniques is tried without using any one consistently for at least a day, the infant may get overstimulated, which can make the colicky situation worse. In contrast, some caregivers may give up trying and withdraw themselves from the infant, which can lead to further stress on both the caregiver and the infant.​[^[3]]​[^[17]]

Table 3 lists some common causes of crying and provides basic management strategies. Crying is one of the few ways a baby can communicate, and the response that the infant receives assures them that someone is listening. The strategies below can be attempted in any order. The nonpharmacological options in Table 3 should take effect very quickly, at the most within a few feeding cycles. If the baby continues to cry, parents should move on to another strategy and not persist with any one measure.​[^[17]]

| Problem | Symptoms | Potential Strategies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hunger | Crying between feedings, inadequate weight gain | Hunger periods often do not follow a regular pattern. Increase feeding frequency as needed. |
| Poor feeding | Refusing bottle or breast | Poor feeding may be indicative of a serious health problem and may lead to dehydration. Consult with a health-care practitioner. |
| Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) | Regular vomiting (more than spitting up), fussiness between feeds and/or refusal to eat, arching of back or neck and/or drawing in legs toward belly after feeds, poor weight gain, frequent coughing, or coughing or gagging when feeding | Feed baby smaller quantities, but more often. Take breaks from feeding to burp. Hold baby in a more upright position while feeding instead of in a laying position. Do not lay baby down immediately after a feed—have baby on an incline with the head above the torso, or hold upright for a period of time.If sufficient benefit is not seen, seek further assessment and possible treatment. |
| Overheated | Crying when tightly swaddled or layered | Reduce baby’s clothing, reduce room temperature. |
| Need for attention or physical contact | Crying or fussiness when left alone | Hold, rock or cuddle baby. Do not worry about spoiling the infant or contributing to a bad habit. |
| Insomnia | Crying, inability to sleep at bedtime | Avoid excessive stimulation or arousal before bedtime. |
| Tiredness | Crying or fussiness when handled | Put the baby down in a dark, quiet room. Unless crying excessively, babies can be left alone for short intervals to see if they will fall asleep on their own. Babies who are crying loudly should be picked up and held or rocked quietly until they fall asleep. |
| Lack of stimulation | Crying or fussiness when left alone | Play with the baby, provide a visual or auditory distraction or place baby in an infant seat or swing where there is a lot of activity, e.g., kitchen. |
| Ear infection | Crying or irritability. Infant may not be sleeping or eating well. Typically preceded by a cold. Occasionally, fluid may be draining out of the ear canal. Fever may be present. Note that infant may be too young to identify localized pain and may not be fingering or pulling on ear | Requires further assessment, particularly if baby <3 months of age and temperature >38°C (even if other symptoms of ear infection are absent). See also Acute Otitis Media in Childhood. |
| Teething | Crying, excessive salivation, inflamed gums. Typically begins after 5 months of age | Rub the baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a rubber teething ring. Refrain from using teething biscuits. Administer analgesics and anti-inflammatories (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) as appropriate (see Teething). |


#### Physical Methods

Physical methods that have been attempted include carrying, rocking, swaddling and skin-to-skin contact, all of which aim to comfort and soothe the baby. Gentle pressure to the abdomen, or massage, are anecdotally helpful to some babies, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated in the literature.​[^[23]]

Babies who demonstrate possible gastric distress by pulling their legs up and arching their backs may derive some relief if their legs are gently pushed back and forth in an alternating or “bicycle” motion. Repetitive motion relaxes infants and the physical contact may have a calming effect.​[^[3]]​[^[17]]

Warm baths may relieve GI spasm. Heating pads should not be used due to the risk of burning the infant. Evidence for the efficacy of chiropractic spinal manipulation is inconclusive and this approach should be discouraged.​[^[24]]

#### Environmental Manipulation

Although white noise has anecdotally been comforting to some infants, evidence shows that it may be damaging to auditory development when used at high volumes and is not recommended for colic.​[^[25]]

Additionally, available evidence suggests that increased carrying, car rides/car-ride simulators and baby swings are not effective in the management of colic symptoms.​[^[3]]​[^[18]]​[^[24]]​[^[26]]

#### Behavioural Management

A colic diary that documents crying and fussing spells may assist caregivers and health-care practitioners in creating a management strategy by helping to establish some patterns in the infant’s day. Caregivers can log behaviours, look for patterns and try to modify these behaviours to see if the situation improves (a sample diary is provided in the Infant Colic—What You Need to Know patient handout). A routine schedule for feeding, holding, playtime and general care can be developed once patterns are established. At the very least, keeping a diary may give a better sense of control and a clearer perspective of a frustrating situation.​[^[3]]​[^[27]] When recommending a diary, it is important to show empathy to the caregiver and to recognize that it may represent additional stress and burden on them, with some caregivers feeling overwhelmed by the additional responsibility.​[^[1]] 

Even though colic is usually self-limiting for the infant, it can take some time to repair the parent/caregiver-infant attachment relationship. If caregivers have difficulty coping with their usual sources of support, and despite reassurance by their health-care practitioner, they may be referred to a mental health professional (e.g., counsellor, psychologist).​[^[3]]​[^[17]]

Behaviour management is as demanding a task on caregivers as any other intervention, and they should be encouraged to rest or take breaks when the infant’s symptoms can no longer be tolerated and to call on support in order to do this.

#### Dietary Manipulation

The majority of the dietary manipulations recommended below require specialized follow-up.

#### Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding should always be encouraged and supported due to the numerous beneficial effects for both the person breastfeeding and the baby. Additionally, weaning a colicky breastfed infant to formula may result in a worsening of symptoms.​[^[3]]​[^[12]]​[^[18]] Limited data suggest that prolonged emptying of 1 breast at each feed (vs. equal drainage of both breasts at each feed) is associated with a lower incidence of colic.​[^[28]] If needed, referral to a lactation consultant for additional breastfeeding strategies and techniques may be helpful.

The link between food allergies and infant colic in breastfed infants without other symptoms of atopy (e.g., eczema) is controversial.​[^[29]] There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of dietary modification in those who breastfeed.​[^[30]] Eliminating allergenic foods, e.g., cow’s milk protein and dairy products, soy, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, and fish, from the breastfeeding person’s diet for 1–2 weeks may reduce colic in a small number of breastfed infants.​[^[11]]​[^[29]]​[^[31]] It is recommended that the breastfeeding person take calcium supplementation if milk and its products are eliminated from the diet.​[^[31]] Counsel individuals that these dietary modifications can be quite demanding on their attention, as ingredients such as dairy and soy may be found in unexpected products. Any recommendations for dietary modification should be approached with caution since early, albeit limited, evidence suggests elimination diets may reduce infant exposure to allergenic proteins via breast milk. This potentially increases the risk of food allergy later in life.​[^[32]] Consultation with a physician or dietitian is recommended prior to initiating these diets. 

Nonallergenic foods noted to aggravate colic in breastfed infants include cabbage, broccoli, caffeine, citrus fruit and chocolate. Limited data suggest that eliminating these foods from the breastfeeding person’s diet for a period of time may help with colicky symptoms.​[^[3]]​[^[29]] Removing too many foods, however, may have an adverse effect on the peron’s nutrition and generate additional stress. Consider referral to a dietitian before significant modifications occur.​[^[3]]​[^[11]]

#### Formula Feeding

Despite evidence showing no difference between hydrolyzed and standard infant formulas for colic, health-care practitioners may advise that bottle-fed babies receive extensively hydrolyzed cow’s milk proteins if there is suspicion of food allergies in a colicky baby.​[^[30]] Substituting standard formulas with hypoallergenic (casein hydrolysate, whey hydrolysate or amino acid–based) formula may reduce duration of crying but may be associated with an increased cost to families and may be less palatable than standard infant formulas.​[^[11]]​[^[26]]​[^[29]]​[^[33]] Hypoallergenic formulas, such as those listed previously, should be reserved for infants with confirmed allergies to cow’s milk protein.​[^[24]] Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic and should not be used in infants with cow’s milk protein allergy. These formulas are not effective in managing symptoms of colic.​[^[34]]

The use of soy protein–based formulas in the treatment of colic is not recommended.​[^[6]]​[^[33]]

As there is no evidence to support the use of low-iron formulas, they are not recommended because they carry an unacceptably high risk of iron deficiency.​[^[35]]

Evidence for the use of lactose-reduced formula or lactase enzyme supplementation is not sufficient to draw conclusions about efficacy of these treatments for colic.​[^[5]]​[^[17]]​[^[29]]​[^[33]] The addition of fibre to formula is not effective.​[^[5]]​[^[18]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

In general, if formula changes are made, they should not be pursued if symptoms do not improve after 1 week.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Frequent formula changes are not recommended.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] For more information, see Infant Nutrition.

#### Feeding Techniques

The following simple techniques can be helpful in feeding a colicky infant:



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Baby Care Products: Gastrointestinal. 

When recommending pharmacologic therapy for infant colic, it is essential to consider that the available evidence is very weak, limited in both quantity and quality; studies are small and subject to serious bias and methodological flaws. As well, a strong placebo effect has been observed across several studies, regardless of the intervention assessed.​[^[36]] The focus of treatment should therefore be on promoting safety for the infant. While there are no head-to-head trials directly comparing pharmacologic interventions for colic, it is likely that some interventions are more effective and safer than others. Choosing a pharmacologic therapy should therefore involve careful consideration of the potential risks to the infant, values of the caregivers and cost. Table 5 describes various pharmacologic therapies for colic.

#### Natural Health Products

#### Probiotics

Along with emerging literature regarding the contribution of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of infant colic comes literature supporting the use of probiotics, specifically *Lactobacillus reuteri* **DSM17398**. Indeed, several supportive systematic reviews and meta-analyses of L. reuteri for infant colic have been published in recent years.​[^[37]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]] One such review of individual patient data from 4 double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 345 infants (median age 5.9 wk) with colic showed that L. reuteri DSM17398, at a dose of 0.2 × 10​[^8] colony-forming units per drop, 5 drops orally per day, significantly reduced crying time compared to placebo-treated infants.​[^[37]] Crying decreased in both groups; however, infants in the probiotic group cried approximately 25 minutes less per day after 3 weeks of treatment. Interestingly, when the group was separated according to feeding type—breastfed or formula-fed—the results were significant only in breastfed infants. The study was underpowered to assess outcomes in the small number of formula-fed infants. Since only 1 RCT (included in the aforementioned systematic review) of L. reuteri for infant colic has included formula-fed infants, it is unknown if a probiotic supplement would be helpful in this subgroup of patients. Clinical trials of L. reuteri have not demonstrated any adverse effects of treatment.​[^[40]] If pharmacologic therapy is to be attempted, L. reuteri is a reasonable first choice, with the caveat that it is of unknown benefit in formula-fed babies. There is likely a class effect of probiotic supplementation to treat infant colic; however, fewer data exist for alternative strains.​[^[41]] An RCT has demonstrated efficacy of a proprietary strain of Bifidobacterium animalis in reducing crying time in young, exclusively breastfed infants with colic;​[^[42]] however, the lack of availability of products designed for administration to small infants in Canada further limits the use of alternative strains. There is insufficient data to support or refute the use of probiotics for the prevention of colic.​[^[43]]

#### Sucrose

Recognizing the pitfalls of the available evidence, sucrose is the second natural health product for which there exists the most evidence in infant colic, following L. reuteri. Studies of sucrose in colic used 12% solutions with marginal benefit compared to placebo,​[^[46]] and its short duration of action of 1–45 minutes​[^[44]] may limit its usefulness in treating colic. However, 24% sucrose solutions have been found effective in managing procedural pain in neonates and infants. Concentration may be relevant, as one of the proposed mechanisms of action for sucrose in infant colic includes taste activation of the endogenous opioid system.​[^[44]] It is reasonable to recommend a 12% solution with titration to 24% if ineffective after 7 days. A 24% sucrose solution is commercially available in baby-friendly droppers that limit bacterial contamination and are safe for use in neonates and infants. See Table 5 for more information. While more well-controlled research is needed before sucrose can be recommended routinely, it represents a reasonable second-line alternative to L. reuteri.

#### Simethicone​[46]

Simethicone is the only drug product that has been studied and licensed by Health Canada for use in infant colic. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that there is no additional benefit of simethicone over placebo. However, the placebo effect in the reported studies was relatively high. Simethicone is not absorbed into systemic circulation and it has a long track record of use in neonates and infants; therefore, safety is not a major concern, aside from a risk of GI upset. Efficacy aside, simethicone may be a safe option for those wishing to use an approved drug product and for whom cost is not an issue. Other drug products are not recommended, such as dicyclomine, which can cause apnea in neonates and young infants.​[^[45]]

#### Alternative Agents

There is limited evidence to suggest that fennel preparations, such as fennel oil, may reduce crying time in infant colic.​[^[36]] Studies are few, methodologically flawed, and of short duration (7 days), limiting assessment of safety. Considering the lack of reliable pharmaceutical-grade fennel oil on the market, lack of standardized dosing recommendations and lack of safety data in young infants, fennel products (and herbal products in general) should not be recommended for infant colic at this time.

A systematic review was able to identify 1 RCT of lactase in infant colic that showed a response in approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients; however, evidence was weak and prone to the limitations mentioned above.​[^[36]] As the trial was only 10 days in duration (among other limitations), the safety of lactase given over longer durations is unknown and it should not be recommended.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

As a reminder, each strategy to ease colic should be trialled independently with no more than 1 change made at a time. Each strategy should be trialled for no more than 3 days, although some may have effect sooner or even immediately. If there is no benefit seen, another strategy should be attempted. If there is some benefit with a new strategy, the intervention can be continued with additional strategies introduced as needed.

Caregivers should be reminded that colic typically spontaneously resolves by 5 months, and interventions may be discontinued as symptoms resolve.

Table 4 provides a framework for a monitoring plan that should be individualized for each patient.

| Parameter | Target | Time Frame for Follow-Up | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Excessive crying | Decreased duration or frequency of crying episodes | After 3 days or at next scheduled visit | If a colic diary was kept, this may be used to analyze patterns to better identify strategies that may be effective.If at first follow-up, several strategies have been used with no success, further investigation is required to rule out organic etiology of crying.If infant cries for ≥3 h without stopping, an immediate and thorough assessment is required. |
| Post-feed discomfort/fussiness | Minimized | After 3 days or at next scheduled visit | If several strategies are tried and feeding-related discomfort and fussiness continue, suggest referral to appropriate health-care practitioner for alterations in maternal diet or formula to rule out allergenic component to colic. |
| Dehydration | None of the following symptoms: tearless crying, reduced urination (resulting in fewer wet diapers than usual), sunken eyes, dry skin and mouth, sunken fontanelle | At each visit | If crying is associated with poor feeding, fever, vomiting, dehydration or significant change in stool or urination pattern, a thorough assessment is required. |
| Fever | None | At each visit |  |
| Weight loss or insufficient weight gain | No weight lossExpected weight gain in this age group is about 20 g/day (use averages over at least 1 wk, as daily fluctuation is expected and normal) | At each visit or when current weight data is available | Any weight loss or dehydration requires immediate physical assessment. |
| Sleep | Improving or trending toward being able to fall asleep, being calm before naptime and bedtime | After 3 days or at next scheduled visit | If a colic diary was kept, this may be used to analyze patterns to better identify strategies that may be effective. |
| Adverse effects of pharmacotherapy | None | Within 3 days of initiating treatment; telephone follow-up may be sufficient | Ensure caregiver is aware of potential adverse effects of whichever treatment is being trialled. Have caregiver call if any adverse effects occur or if uncertain about anything. |
| Parental/caregiver stress/anxiety | Decreased stress/anxiety, increased coping skills and strategies | After 3 days or at next scheduled visit | Reassure parents and re-emphasize coping strategies at each visit.Remind them to take “time out” rest periods away from the infant.If they continue to seem frustrated or overwhelmed, refer to an appropriate health-care practitioner for counselling. |


#### Advice for the Caregiver

Advise caregivers of colicky babies regarding:

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart designed to assess and manage an infant's crying, specifically focusing on identifying colic and other potential causes. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Start Point: Assess Infant's Symptoms**
   - Begin by assessing the infant's symptoms.

2. **Symptoms Consistent with Colic?**
   - Criteria: Prolonged crying with or without flushing, facial expressions suggestive of pain, abdominal distension, flatus, and drawing up of the legs over the abdomen.
   - If **Yes**, check for red flags.
   - If **No**, conduct alternative assessments for common causes of crying (refer to Table 3a).

3. **Red Flags Present? (See Table 2b)**
   - If **Yes**, requires urgent assessment.
   - If **No**, verify the age of the infant with the caregiver.

4. **Age Verification:**
   - **< 2 weeks**: Colic unlikely. Requires assessment.
   - **2–16 weeks**: Check if the caregiver has addressed common causes of crying (see Table 3a).
   - **> 16 weeks**: Colic unlikely. Consider teething, infection, or other organic diagnosis. Requires assessment.

5. **Caregiver Addressed Common Causes?**
   - If **Yes**, determine if crying episodes are unexplained, recurrent, prolonged, and cannot be resolved or prevented by the caregiver.
   - If **No**, advise the caregiver on simple management strategies to deal with crying (see Table 3a).

6. **Unexplained Crying Episodes?**
   - If **Yes**, check if the caregiver suspects a physical problem causing pain or itch, or if the infant has cried for more than 3 hours without stopping.
   - If **No**, provide a conditional diagnosis of colic.

7. **Physical Problem or Prolonged Crying?**
   - If **Yes**, requires urgent assessment.
   - If **No**, assess if the social situation is compromised by excessive caregiver stress or frustration.

8. **Social Situation Compromised?**
   - If **Yes**, requires urgent assessment.
   - If **No**, provide a conditional diagnosis of colic and counsel the caregiver on feeding techniques, behavioral management, and environmental manipulation.

9. **Consider Pharmacologic Therapy:**
   - If the caregiver is overly frustrated and feels medication will help (see Table 5d).
   - Consider placebo effect, contraindications, previous effectiveness, and toxicity in treatment selection.

10. **Discuss Monitoring Plan with Caregiver:**
    - Conclude by discussing a monitoring plan with the caregiver.

11. **Has Crying Resolved?**
    - If **Yes**, continue with current management.
    - If **No**, requires further assessment.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing infant crying, with specific attention to identifying colic and addressing caregiver concerns.
