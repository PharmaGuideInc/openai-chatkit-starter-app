#### Introduction

Hypovolemia is a generic term encompassing volume depletion and dehydration.​[^[1]] Volume depletion is the loss of sodium-containing fluid from the intravascular and interstitial spaces, and is more frequently associated with hypotension and tachycardia than is dehydration. Dehydration, such as from excess sweating, implies loss of water from both extracellular (intravascular and interstitial) and intracellular spaces and leads to elevated plasma Na​[^+] and osmolality. Causes of hypovolemia include hemorrhage; volume losses from GI tract, kidneys, skin or respiratory tract; and fluid sequestration or third-space losses (loss of intravascular volume). The focus of this chapter is the treatment of adults. For treatment of children, see Dehydration in Children. 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Therapy is designed to restore volume while replacing ongoing losses and addressing the primary cause (see Figure 1). Concurrent fluid and electrolyte disorders will influence rate of replacement and choice of fluid used (see Table 1). The severity of hypovolemia is expressed as a percentage of total body weight, assuming each litre of fluid lost weighs 1 kg.



#### Determining Fluid Requirements

There is no precise formula since disease, age, source and rate of fluid loss influence fluid requirements. The amount and composition of replacement fluid chosen will depend on the type of fluid loss and assessment of the patient’s individual needs. Fluid prescribing should be given the same status as drug prescribing.​[^[5]]

In nonhemorrhagic hypovolemia with obvious hemodynamic compromise, begin with at least 1 L of crystalloid over 30 minutes and a second litre over the next hour. Closely monitor HR, BP, peripheral perfusion and jugular venous pressure, watching for improvement or fluid overload. Delay in volume repletion can lead to ischemic injury and multiorgan system failure. In less severe hypovolemia, give 250–500 mL/h of crystalloid. Continue fluid administration until treatment goals are achieved.

Crystalloids are recommended for fluid resuscitation of critically ill patients, including those with sepsis.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] A study comparing 4% albumin (colloid) with normal saline (crystalloid) for fluid resuscitation in ICU patients yielded similar outcomes, including 28-day mortality;​[^[8]] colloid solutions are not recommended for acute resuscitation due to their higher cost and lack of superiority over crystalloids.​[^[7]] The latest evidence suggests there may be a benefit to using a balanced crystalloid solution such as Ringer lactate in resuscitation of critically ill and noncritically ill patients.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] Due to safety concerns,​[^[11]] use of starch compounds should be avoided in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis, as they increase the risk of acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy and mortality.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] The fluid of choice in the acute management of burns is not clearly established.​[^[6]]

Maintenance fluids must be administered in addition to those given to correct the deficit. In adults, maintenance is possible with approximately 30 mL/kg/day or 2000–2500 mL/day containing approximately 75 mmol of Na​[^+] and 50 mmol of K​[^+] in a 24-hour period. This could be provided, for example, by using dextrose 3.3% with sodium chloride 0.3% and 20 mmol K+ added to each litre.

For hemorrhagic hypovolemia, early use of blood products over crystalloid resuscitation results in better outcomes. Balanced transfusion using 1:1:1 or 1:1:2 ratio of plasma to platelets to packed red blood cells results in better hemostasis.​[^[14]] In the CRASH-2 trial,​[^[15]] administration of tranexamic acid to patients with severe bleed within 3 hours of traumatic injury appears to decrease death from major bleed. Research on oxygen-carrying substitutes as an alternative to red blood cells is ongoing, and no blood substitutes have been approved for use in North America.​[^[16]]

Other commercially available crystalloid solutions are more costly and, aside from dextrose 3.3% with sodium chloride 0.3% (2/3–1/3) or dextrose 5% with sodium chloride 0.45% (D5-1/2 NS), they play little role in managing volume depletion. Users of other crystalloids must be aware of their contents. For example, Ringer lactate contains calcium, potassium and lactate in addition to sodium and may not be suitable for some patients, e.g., those with renal dysfunction.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing hypovolemia. It outlines steps for emergency resuscitation and assessment of hypovolemia severity.

1. **Initial Steps:**
   - Emergency resuscitation to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.
   - History to detect the cause of hypovolemia.
   - Physical exam to confirm hypovolemia and assess severity.

2. **Decision Points:**
   - **Hypovolemia Uncertain:**
     - Action: IV fluid challenge.
   
   - **Mild Hypovolemia (<5% of body weight):**
     - Action: Oral fluids.
   
   - **Moderate or Severe Hypovolemia (≥5% of body weight):**
     - Symptoms: Postural tachycardia ± postural fall of systolic pressure.
     - Actions:
       - D5W if dehydration is prominent.
       - Crystalloid for volume depletion.
       - Blood products for hemorrhagic hypovolemia (including trauma).

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and treating different severities of hypovolemia, with specific interventions based on the severity and symptoms.

**Drug Class: Colloids**

| Drug/​Cost | Indications | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **frozen plasma** | Major hemorrhage or microvascular bleeding. | Fluid overload.Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (rare). | One unit contains 400–900 mg fibrinogen. |
| **platelets** | Major hemorrhage, platelet dysfunction or marked bleeding. | Platelets are stored at 20–24​◦C, so there is a small risk of bacterial contamination. | One unit contains approximately 30 × 10​10 platelets. Shelf-life is 5–7 days. |
| **red blood cells** | Hemorrhage. | Fluid overload.1:300 febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction per unit of RBC. | Replaces or increases oxygen-carrying capacity. |
| **dextrose 5% in water (D5W)** (generics) | Dehydration. | Interstitial edema, hyperglycemia. | Poor plasma volume expander. Water is distributed to both intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid after dextrose metabolism. |
| **Ringer lactate (Na​+ 130 mmol/L)** (Lactated Ringer Injection, generics) | Initial treatment of hypovolemia. | Fluid overload, interstitial edema, dilutional coagulopathy, hyponatremia; may aggravate pre-existing hyperkalemia. | Contains Ca​++ 1.4 mmol/L, K​+ 4 mmol/L, Cl​- 109 mmol/L, lactate 28 mmol/L.pH 6.4 |
| **sodium chloride 0.9% (normal saline or NS; Na​+ 154 mmol/L)** (generics) | Initial treatment of hypovolemia. | Fluid overload, interstitial edema, dilutional coagulopathy.Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with infusion of large amounts of NS (usually >3 L). Hypernatremia. | Intravenous solutions with Na​+ concentrations that approximate normal serum Na​+ cause more intravascular and interstitial expansion than do D5W solutions.pH 5.7 |

Hyperglycemia. | Intravenous solutions with Na​+ concentrations that approximate normal serum Na​+ cause more intravascular and interstitial expansion than do D5W solutions.Compared with NS or Ringer lactate, D5W results in comparatively small changes in plasma volume because it distributes throughout the total body water space, including the intracellular space. |
| **sodium chloride 0.45% (half-normal saline or 1/2 NS; Na​+ 77 mmol/L)** (generics) | Maintenance fluids. | Fluid overload, interstitial edema, dilutional coagulopathy.Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with infusion of large amounts of NS (usually >3 L). | Intravenous solutions with Na​+ concentrations that approximate normal serum Na​+ cause more intravascular and interstitial expansion than do D5W solutions. |

| **dextrose 5% with sodium chloride 0.45%, D5W-1/2NS (Na​+ 77 mmol/L)** (generics) | Maintenance fluids. | Fluid overload, interstitial edema, dilutional coagulopathy.Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with infusion of large amounts of NS (usually >3 L). Hyperglycemia. | Intravenous solutions with Na​+ concentrations that approximate normal serum Na​+ cause more intravascular and interstitial expansion than do D5W solutions. |
| **albumin** (Alburex 5, Alburex 25, Plasbumin-5, Plasbumin-25, generics) | Volume depletion.Contraindicated in patients at risk of circulatory overload, such as those with history of heart failure, renal insufficiency or stabilized chronic anemia. | Fluid overload, anaphylactoid/anaphylaxis (rare). | Albumin is a blood product.Volume remains within the extracellular compartment.Albumin 5% is iso-oncotic (does not pull fluid into the intravascular space) with normal plasma; intravenous infusion will expand circulating blood volume by an amount approximately equal to the amount infused; does not aggravate tissue dehydration; concomitant use of crystalloids may be necessary to maintain fluid balance.Albumin 25% will expand plasma volume 3–4 times the volume infused. There is little evidence to support the routine use of albumin in managing hypovolemia.​[17] |
| **dextran 40 in dextrose 5% or normal saline, respectively** (Dextran 40 in Dextrose Injection, Dextran 40 in Sodium Chloride Injection) | Volume depletion. | Aggravation of bleeding; interference with blood coagulation; anaphylaxis with higher molecular weight solutions. | Not commonly used as plasma expander. |
| **hydroxyethyl starch (tetrastarch) 6% in isotonic electrolyte or normal saline, respectively** (Volulyte, Voluven) | Volume depletion. | Bleeding, fluid overload, liver failure, renal injury, pruritus; macroamylase formation may lead to incorrect diagnosis of pancreatitis because of possibility of increase in blood amylase; anaphylactoid reaction (rare). | Not commonly used as plasma expander.Contraindicated in patients with sepsis, severe liver disease or renal impairment (anuria and oliguria) not related to hypovolemia. |
