CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “women” or “female” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Sexual dysfunction impacts the quality of life of people of all genders. This chapter addresses 3 disorders of sexual function: female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD) and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. 

Sexual response results from the brain's appraisal of sexual stimuli to trigger feelings of sexual excitement, arousal and desire as well as physical responses including genital blood flow and congestion (see Figure 1).​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Although the major factors influencing sexual response are mood, stress,​[^[6]] feelings for sexual partners and past sexual experiences,​[^[7]]​[^[8]] other aspects of health, such as medical conditions, obesity,​[^[9]] medications, surgery, radiation or aging, may contribute to impairment.​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]]

Multiple factors influence a patient’s motivation to begin a sexual encounter,​[^[7]]​[^[14]] their response to stimulation and level of arousal. Frequently the degree of subjective arousal and genital congestion are poorly correlated.​[^[15]] A lack of subjective arousal commonly occurs despite a genital vasocongestive response.​[^[15]] A patient’s awareness of the engorgement of the genitalia is often minimal. The subjective experience is influenced more consistently by concurrent thoughts and emotions than by feedback from the vasocongesting genitalia.​[^[16]] In assessing a patient’s sexual concerns, it is recommended to interview both the patient and any partner who is interested in particpating, preferably together and separately (see Table 1).​[^[17]]

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart illustrating the cycle of sexual desire and intimacy. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Seemingly “spontaneous” desire**:
   - Central element in the flowchart.
   - Connected to two pathways:
     - **Sexually neutral; many motivations including enhancing emotional intimacy**: This suggests that desire can arise from non-sexual motivations, such as the desire to enhance emotional intimacy.
     - **Sexual stimuli**: Leads to seeking out and being receptive to stimuli.

2. **Sexual stimuli**:
   - Leads to **sexual arousal**.
   - Accompanied by the note: "Leads to seeking out and being receptive to."

3. **Sexual arousal**:
   - Influenced by "Biological and psychological factors affect processing of stimuli."
   - Leads to **sexual desire**.

4. **Sexual desire**:
   - Flows into **enhanced intimacy**.
   - This transition is noted as "More arousal and pleasure; positive outcome emotionally and physically."

5. **Enhanced intimacy**:
   - Loops back to **seemingly “spontaneous” desire**, completing the cycle.

The flowchart illustrates how sexual desire can be influenced by both sexual and non-sexual factors, leading to a cycle of arousal, desire, and enhanced intimacy.

#### FSIAD & FOD

#### Introduction

To make a diagnosis of FSIAD, there must be a lack of sexual interest/arousal for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months as manifested by at least 3 of the following indicators:​[^[18]]



Note that the diagnosis of female hypoactive desire disorder and female arousal disorder have been merged into FSIAD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-5) to increase diagnostic precision. FSIAD includes potential loss of genital sexual sensitivity seen typically at menopause.

To make a diagnosis of FOD, at least 1 of the 2 following symptoms must have been present for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months and be experienced on all or almost all (approximately 75%) occasions of sexual activity:​[^[18]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Standard therapy includes cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sexual therapy and, more recently, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).​[^[26]]​[^[27]]



Specific for FOD:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Note that there is a significant psychosocial aspect to sexual difficulties experienced some patients, and current systemic treatment options have been found to be minimally superior to placebo.​[^[28]] 

#### Topical

Use **local **estrogen when lack of genital congestion, loss of pleasure from genital stimulation, loss of lubrication or dyspareunia are associated with estrogen-deficient states (see Menopause).

**Vaginal** lubricants (e.g., Astroglide) or **moisturizers** (e.g., Replens, Gynatrof, Zestica) used regularly improve lubrication but may not remove pain from lost elasticity.

Vaginal **dehydroepiandrosterone (**DHEA**)** provides a sexual benefit in terms of motivation and desire seemingly from increases in coital comfort, genital sexual sensitivity and ease of orgasm without any increase in serum levels of testosterone or estrogen.​[^[29]] Vaginal DHEA, prasterone (Intrarosa) was approved by Health Canada in 2019 for the treatment of GSM. It is also used off label for menopausal loss of genital sexual sensitivity. DHEA can also be compounded into a cream or vaginal suppository.

#### Systemic

In North America, testosterone supplementation is not approved or recommended for women. While testosterone has been prescribed off-label for complaints of low desire in those who are postmenopausal, there is ample evidence that low desire in these patients is not related to testosterone levels.​[^[22]] RCTs showed conflicting results with testosterone.​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]] The trials were underpowered and lacked appropriate inclusion criteria and long-term safety data. Although the last American Endocrine Society guidelines recommended short-term treatment with investigational testosterone limited to accurately diagnosed hypoactive sexual desire disorder, that diagnosis is no longer clinically relevant with the 2013 DSM-5 criteria.​[^[34]] ​[^[35]]Importantly, the lack of safety data beyond 2 years also precludes recommendation of investigational testosterone for female sexual dysfunction.​[^[34]]

Flibanserin is a serotonin agonist/antagonist and weak partial dopamine agonist with approval by Health Canada in 2018 for low sexual desire in premenopausal patients. Its use leads to a mean increase of 0.49 satisfying sexual events per month and an increase of 0.3–0.4 on the desire subscale of a validated questionnaire (mean baseline is 1.8–1.9 on a scale of 1.2–6.0).​[^[36]] Major drug interactions are a concern; alcohol and moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) cause hypotension with a risk of syncope and must be strictly avoided.​[^[36]] The minimal benefit and daily dosing requirement along with drug interaction concerns limits the drug’s use. 

Sildenafil in clinical practice and randomized controlled trials has not been found to benefit patients with impaired physical arousal (e.g., sexual dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury). With the exception of one small RCT investigating the use of sildenafil (50–100 mg as needed prior to sexual activity) in antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction,​[^[37]] sildenafil has not been found clinically useful.

The treatment and remission of depression improves sexual desire and function beyond any sexual dysfunction that may emerge as a side effect from medication. Preferably choose sexually neutral drugs, e.g., bupropion, vortioxetine or vilazodone​[^[23]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]] (see Table 2).

#### Genito-pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

#### Introduction

To make this diagnosis, persistent or recurrent difficulties for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months with 1 or more of the following must be present:​[^[18]]



*Dyspareunia* is persistent or recurrent pain with attempted or complete vaginal entry and/or penetrative vaginal intercourse.​[^[25]] *Vaginismus* is the persistent or recurrent difficulty of a patient to allow vaginal entry of a finger, a penis and/or any object, despite the patient’s expressed wish to do so. There is often phobic avoidance and anticipation/fear/experience of pain, along with variable and involuntary pelvic muscle contraction. Vaginismus and dyspareunia are now merged under genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder due to clinical overlap.

Because some patients are unable to endure penetration, penile introital contact may have rarely or never been possible in those who desire it. A history of unconsummated heterosexual relationships with or without allodynia of the vestibule observed during physical examination can confirm a diagnosis of vaginismus. 

*Provoked vestibulodynia* (PVD) is the most common cause of dyspareunia affecting about 16% of patients.​[^[40]]​[^[41]] The pain is typically from touch to the vaginal opening (including attempted vaginal penetration) associated with allodynia (pain sensation from a non-painful stimulus) around the outer edge of the hymen and no abnormal physical signs other than variable redness. Other chronic pain syndromes are typically present including severe dysmenorrhea in adolescence.​[^[42]] 

*Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)*: the dyspareunia associated with the pallor, loss of elasticity, skin turgor and atrophy of labia minora can lead to symptoms similar to those of PVD: painful introitus, pain with penetration and movement, and post-coital burning. Note that the 2 conditions may coexist.​[^[43]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause

Intravaginal estrogen is beneficial for GSM (see Menopause) using tablet, cream or Silastic ring formulation to restore vaginal cell health, pH and to increase vulvar and vaginal blood flow. When systemic estrogen is used for nonsexual reasons, additional topical vaginal estrogen may still be required. Vaginal DHEA improves dyspareunia associated with GSM along with other aspects of sexual function without an increase in serum levels of testosterone and estrogen. **Vaginal** hyaluronic acid **hydrogel** provides similar benefit to 0.5 mg estriol cream when applied every 3 days with benefits being seen in 2 weeks.​[^[47]] Other **vaginal** lubricants and **vaginal moisturizers** can be helpful when used regularly to improve lubrication (see Menopause).

Intravaginal estrogen therapy may be required for GSM associated with chemotherapy-induced menopause. Sudden iatrogenic loss of ovarian estrogen is frequently highly symptomatic. For patients with estrogen-dependent cancer, an individual approach is necessary. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that while nonhormonal treatments are preferred, current low-dose estrogen vaginal products do not raise serum estrogen levels above those in untreated menopausal patients and are not associated with higher breast cancer recurrence rates or endometrial stimulation.​[^[48]] More research is required before recommendations can be made regarding the use of vaginal estrogens in patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (where the goal of adjuvant therapy is a complete absence of estrogen at the tissue level).​[^[48]]

#### Provoked Vestibulodynia

Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of PVD are lacking. The application of a local anti-inflammatory (i.e., sodium cromoglycate) to prevent the release of inflammatory agents from mast cells or the introital application of a local anesthetic (i.e., lidocaine) is of benefit to some patients.​[^[50]]​[^[51]] The local anesthetic may be used in conjunction with psychological therapy: a patient may regain sexual confidence with different types of sex and experience reduced distress and pain intensity as therapy progresses. Topical local anesthetic can be applied to residual allodynia prior to a sexual encounter. The lessened reactivity to physical sensations and the expectation of less pain and elevated reward contribute to reduced intensity of dyspareunia. PVD at menopause may benefit from local estrogen applied directly to the introitus. There is consensus to recommend against the use of topical steroids and botulinum toxins.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] Although some patients may benefit from either tricyclic antidepressants (with or without additional local anesthetic) or antiseizure drugs, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in the treatment of PVD.

#### Other

For recurrent posterior fourchette tearing, intravaginal estrogen **cream** can be applied topically to the affected area. Topical testosterone 2% (compounded in a vehicle such as Glaxal Base) is also helpful. Apply sparingly daily to the posterior fourchette and review in 3 months.
