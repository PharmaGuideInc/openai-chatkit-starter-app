#### Introduction

Rome IV criteria define diarrhea as loose or watery stools, without predominant abdominal pain or bothersome bloating, occurring in >25% of stools.​[^[1]] Clinically, stool consistency between types 5–7 on the Bristol stool form scale may be used to guide diagnosis (see Constipation in Adults for Bristol scale).​[^[2]] Increased loss of fecal water and electrolytes occurs with the increased excretion of fecal matter. Patients who have other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as fecal incontinence or fecal urgency, or who notice a change in stool consistency, may refer to it as diarrhea. These symptoms will need to be ruled out before a true diagnosis of diarrhea is given.

Diarrhea may be defined as acute (<14 days in duration), persistent (14–30 days in duration) or chronic (>30 days in duration).​[^[3]] While acute diarrhea is often caused by infection (see Table 1), the causes of chronic diarrhea are not always clear. As diagnostic tests are often not readily available, a specific diagnosis may not be possible. Patients who present with chronic diarrhea pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians.​[^[5]] During the initial evaluation of these patients, it may be useful to categorize the various etiologies of chronic diarrhea by typical stool characteristics (see Table 2).

#### Infectious Diarrhea



#### Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea



#### Chronic Diarrhea

Figure 2 illustrates the evaluation of chronic diarrhea; Table 2 outlines the conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are 2 conditions commonly associated with chronic diarrhea. The Rome IV diagnostic criteria for IBS are recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week in the past 3 months associated with 2 or more of the following: a change in frequency of stool, a change in appearance of stool or pain related to defecation. Symptom onset should be at least 6 months before diagnosis and symptoms should be present during the past 3 months.​[^[1]] See Irritable Bowel Syndrome. IBD is an idiopathic condition characterized by chronic or relapsing immune activation and inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. The 2 major forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). UC is restricted to the colon while CD may involve any part of the GI tract. See Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 4 lists the agents used in the management of diarrhea.

#### Acute Diarrhea

#### Infectious Diarrhea

Use **oral rehydration therapy**** (ORT)** to prevent dehydration and electrolyte loss in both acute and chronic diarrhea (see Dehydration in Children). Oral rehydration solutions should have a balanced sodium-to-glucose ratio. Excess glucose (e.g., Jell-O or soft drinks) or excess sodium (e.g., Gatorade or other sports drinks) may aggravate diarrhea as a consequence of their osmotic effect. Early use of ORT is essential for young children and the elderly.

Balanced electrolyte oral rehydration solutions are available commercially without prescription, e.g., Gastrolyte, Pedialyte. If necessary, a similar solution can be made by adding one-half teaspoonful (2.5 mL) of salt and 6 teaspoonfuls (30 mL) of sugar to 4 cups (1 L) of water.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

Aside from travellers’ diarrhea (see Travellers' Diarrhea), empiric **antibiotic** treatment is not generally recommended for acute diarrhea because of the self-limiting nature of most illnesses, the cost of treatment, the potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance and the possibility of adverse drug reactions.​[^[13]]​[^[15]]

Bismuth subsalicylate has been shown to be effective in small cohort studies in the treatment of acute diarrhea and diarrhea caused by microscopic colitis (see Table 4).​[^[3]]​[^[16]] Although frequently used in acute diarrheas, there is no clear evidence for its efficacy. The salicylate component can cause gastric and duodenal mucosal damage, particularly in patients who are also taking ASA or NSAIDs. At high doses, the calcium carbonate in the tablet formulation can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and associated metabolic symptoms. Bismuth-related encephalopathy can result from the use of doses 10 times those recommended or after years of use. Black stools due to bismuth may be confused with melena.

Opioids (codeine, diphenoxylate, loperamide) are effective antimotility agents for symptomatic use in both acute and chronic diarrhea (see Table 4). While adverse effects (e.g., sedation) may limit their use in acute diarrhea, patients usually develop tolerance to these effects with chronic use. Antimotility effects are not desired if the diarrhea is caused by microorganisms because gastrointestinal stasis may enhance the infection.​[^[13]]​[^[17]] Codeine offers the additional effects of sedation and analgesia. Diphenoxylate and loperamide have fewer CNS side effects than other opioids. Diphenoxylate is combined with atropine to limit its potential for abuse. Loperamide has the lowest incidence of side effects, is available without prescription, and is effective in patients with ileorectal pouch incontinence and radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Combining loperamide with simethicone provides faster and more complete relief of acute diarrhea associated with gas-related abdominal discomfort.​[^[18]] While CNS effects are not observed at recommended doses, there are reports of loperamide being abused as an opioid substitute, either to self-treat opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve a feeling of euphoria. The supratherapeutic doses (50–300 mg) taken to achieve CNS opioid effects have been associated with cardiac dysrhythmias and death.​[^[12]]​[^[19]] Typical symptoms of opioid toxicity may also be present.​[^[20]] Health-care practitioners should exercise caution when recommending or providing loperamide to patients with a risk of, or history of, opioid abuse.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts.​[^[21]] It should be noted that within species, different strains of microbes can have widely different biological activities. Furthermore, many effects of these microbiota are strain- and dose-specific. Although there have been multiple studies examining probiotics for various conditions, including C. difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, there are still significant knowledge gaps. It has been difficult to draw conclusions from meta-analyses or systematic reviews because of differences in strains and doses of microbes used, study design (e.g., included populations, follow-up durations, end points and outcomes), and relatively small sample sizes. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of probiotics as part of clinical practice.​[^[21]]

#### Clostridioides difficile Infection

Management of C. difficile–associated diarrhea consists of the following key steps: diagnose C. difficile infection (CDI), prevent spread, cease causative antibiotic, implement supportive measures in severe cases (hospitalization, rehydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances) and eradicate CDI. 

Eradication therapy is required in patients with symptoms (usually diarrhea) and confirmed diagnosis of CDI (positive stool test for C. difficile toxin) or visual confirmation of pseudomembranous colitis. Therapy may be initiated prior to confirmed diagnosis in the presence of high clinical suspicion and severe symptoms. There is no evidence to support screening for asymptomatic C. difficile carriers.​[^[10]]

Table 3 outlines the assessment and management of CDI. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are the preferred agents for an initial episode of CDI; metronidazole may be considered for nonsevere CDI only.​[^[10]]​[^[22]]

A first CDI relapse will occur in approximately 25% of patients and should be managed based upon the choice of first-line therapy used.​[^[10]] A second relapse should be investigated for other causes of diarrhea and, if C. difficile is confirmed, treated with a tapered or pulsed vancomycin oral regimen; a standard vancomycin regimen followed by rifaximin therapy; or a standard fidaxomicin regimen. For a third or subsequent recurrence, consider referral for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).​[^[10]]

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of donor stool from a healthy individual to a sick patient, either by colonoscopy or oral capsule delivery. It has been shown to restore intestinal dysbiosis and is highly effective in treating recurrent CDI with a success rate of at least 90% after a single treatment.​[^[23]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]] There is retrospective evidence suggesting that FMT has mortality benefit in severe CDI, but not in nonsevere cases.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] The short-term safety profile has been excellent; however, there have been a few case reports of FMT resulting in infectious transmission, including transmission of multi-drug resistant E. coli and toxin-producing E. coli.​[^[29]] Such risks can be mitigated by more rigorous donor screening. Although Health Canada considers FMT to be an investigational new biologic drug, there is a policy in place that permits FMT outside of a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI not responsive to conventional therapies.​[^[30]] Despite this provision, access to FMT is still limited, partly due to restrictions set by regional health authorities and partly due to a lack of funding. Investigations of products to eliminate potential risks due to changes in donor health are in early stages of investigation.​[^[31]]

Bezlotoxumab is a therapeutic adjunct for recurrent CDI which is available in the United States but not yet in Canada. It is a human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B that has proven more effective than placebo in reducing the rates of recurrent CDI following a course of standard anti-CDI therapy.​[^[32]]

For patients requiring treatment with antimicrobials during or shortly after the completion of their C. difficile therapy, concomitant oral vancomycin can be considered until the antimicrobials are stopped. A retrospective study found vancomycin prophylaxis in this context to be an effective strategy for decreasing the risk of further CDI recurrence in patients re-exposed to antibiotics.​[^[33]]

There is no role for probiotic monotherapy in the acute treatment or prevention of CDI in adults and children;​[^[34]] however, the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii may be marginally effective when used in conjunction with antibiotic treatment to prevent C. difficile recurrence.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] There is no evidence that adding cholestyramine, colestipol or rifampin to the antibiotic treatment regimen decreases the risk of further recurrence, and resins are contraindicated with antibiotics since they can bind to and sequester antibiotics in the gut.​[^[10]]

Antimotility agents should be avoided in symptomatic CDI because their use increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon.​[^[37]]

#### Chronic Diarrhea

See Infectious Diarrhea for a discussion of ORT and opioids.

#### Hydrophilic Bulking Agents

Although psyllium may reduce nonspecific diarrheal symptoms, its role in the management of diarrhea is limited. Many psyllium-containing products are combined with laxatives; avoid these products in patients with diarrhea.

Cholestyramine resin is useful in treating bile acid–induced diarrhea due to malabsorption of bile acids in diseased ileum (e.g., Crohn disease) or in some cases of irritable bowel syndrome where rapid transit results in loss of bile acids into the colon.

#### Alpha2-adrenergic Agonists

Clonidine may be effective for diarrhea in irritable bowel syndrome, opioid withdrawal and diabetic autonomic neuropathy.​[^[38]] The dose required to achieve an antidiarrheal effect may be associated with sedation, dry mouth and orthostatic hypotension.

#### Somatostatin Analogues

Somatostatin analogues can be administered subcutaneously daily (octreotide) or intramuscularly monthly (**octreotide acetate**, lanreotide **acetate**). These agents have been used to control diarrhea caused by neuroendocrine tumors (VIPoma, carcinoid, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid). Octreotide also limits idiopathic and infant secretory diarrhea, as well as diarrhea associated with ileostomy, short bowel syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, cryptosporidia, graft versus host disease and HIV infection.

Somatostatin has a short half-life and requires continuous IV infusion, which limits its role in the management of diarrhea.

#### Public Health Considerations



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Bulk-forming agents, e.g., psyllium, are first choice in treating diarrhea in pregnancy.​[^[39]] Having limited human pregnancy data, loperamide is considered second line for treatment of diarrhea in pregnancy.​[^[39]] A prospective clinical trial of 89 patients exposed to loperamide in the first trimester of pregnancy found no increased risk of major malformations compared with matched controls.​[^[40]] A retrospective analysis of 651 patients exposed to loperamide in early pregnancy found a slightly increased risk of malformation, although many treatment parameters were unknown and multitesting impacted results.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Diphenoxylate/​atropine should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding since it has been found to be teratogenic in animals​[^[43]] and its active metabolite is probably excreted in breast milk.​[^[43]]

Cholestyramine is used to treat cholestasis of pregnancy and can be used to manage diarrhea resulting from ileal resection or cholecystectomy.​[^[44]] Use it with caution during pregnancy or breastfeeding since fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and coagulopathy can occur. Avoid bismuth subsalicylate in pregnancy because salicylates can be absorbed and may lead to increased perinatal mortality, premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, neonatal hemorrhage, decreased birth weight, prolonged gestation and labour, and possible teratogenicity.​[^[45]] Salicylates should be used cautiously while breastfeeding since they are transferred into breast milk.

Metronidazole is not associated with congenital malformations.​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]] It is transferred into breast milk, and breastfeeding should be suspended until treatment with this drug is completed.​[^[49]] Vancomycin has not been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant patients. There is limited human data on its use while breastfeeding, but it is probably safe.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
