#### Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect approximately 4 million Canadians.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] It often coexists with cardiovascular disease and diabetes and is recognized as a risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease.​[^[4]]

Kidney function is described using the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or creatinine clearance (ClCr). Estimated GFR (eGFR) is calculated and reported using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation or the newer Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] The CKD-EPI equation was developed to provide an estimate of renal function that is closer to a measured value than the MDRD equation, especially when actual GFR is >60 mL/min/1.73m​[^2]. An estimated creatinine clearance can also be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation or measured using a 24-hour urine collection. The equations have limitations, especially at the extremes of age and muscle mass, but are more reliable than serum creatinine alone. See Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment and Renal Function Calculator.

An estimated or measured GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2] is considered abnormal for all adults. A value of more than 60 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2] is considered abnormal if it is accompanied by abnormalities of urine sediment or of imaging tests, or if the patient has had a kidney biopsy with abnormalities.

CKD is defined as the presence of kidney damage for a period greater than 3 months. The eGFRs used to characterize the stages of CKD are listed in Table 1.

| KDIGO Stage | GFR (mL/min/1.73 m​2) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | ≥90 | Normal or high |
| G2 | 60–89 | Mildly decreased |
| G3a | 45–59 | Mildly to moderately decreased |
| G3b | 30–44 | Moderately to severely decreased |
| G4 | 15–29 | Severely decreased |
| G5 | <15 | Kidney failure (add ’D’ if treated by dialysis) |

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes

CKD was previously thought to be progressive, with the patient experiencing a decline in function over time and ultimately requiring dialysis. With the development of new interventions and prevention strategies, patients with CKD, particularly those without proteinuria, may have little progression of their kidney disease; however, they remain at high risk for cardiovascular events and death.​[^[8]] In patients with a preserved GFR, proteinuria alone is a risk factor for loss of kidney function (lower estimated GFR and higher albuminuria).​[^[9]] 

This chapter summarizes the management of patients with chronic kidney disease excluding those on renal replacement therapy.

Refer patients with the following conditions/results to a nephrologist:​[^[14]]



For patients with a new finding of eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2], the physician should determine the stability of the patient’s eGFR, repeat test within 2–4 weeks and then again in 3–6 months.​[^[3]] Consider reversible causes, such as intercurrent illness, volume depletion, medications (e.g., NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, IV contrast dye) and obstruction. If the eGFR remains between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2], consider referral to a nephrologist. 

 The Ontario Renal Network developed the KidneyWise Clinical Toolkit to outline the identification and management for CKD in primary care. Included in the toolkit is the Kidney Failure Risk Equation, which may be used to estimate the risk of kidney failure in a patient with stages 3–5 CKD.​[^[15]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices​[3]​[7]

Encourage patients to exercise for 30–60 minutes 4–7 days per week to reduce the possibility of becoming hypertensive or to lower blood pressure in those with hypertension.

Encourage smoking cessation to slow progression of CKD and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). 

Alcohol intake should be limited to 2 drinks or less per day as there is no known safe amount that will not elevate blood pressure.​[^[16]]

Patients with CKD and hypertension should follow a low sodium diet: <90 mmol/day Na, or 2 g Na or 5 g NaCl/day (see Special Diets).

If serum potassium >5 mmol/L, first consider medications that can be discontinued, such as potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics. If these medications are not present, advise dietary potassium restriction or consider increasing potassium excretion with either a diuretic (loop or thiazide/thiazide-like) or potassium binders. Note that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists may also contribute to the hyperkalemia; continue these agents if they’re being used to decrease proteinuria and restrict dietary potassium instead, or increase potassium excretion from the body (see Potassium Disturbances).

Dietary protein intake has been the focus of several trials; however, there is a lack of convincing evidence that a long-term protein-restricted diet (<0.7 g/kg/day) delays the progression of CKD. A diet that is protein-controlled (0.8–1 g/kg/day) is recommended.

Referral to a renal dietitian is recommended to guide sodium, potassium and protein intake.

Encourage weight loss if patient has obesity (BMI >30 kg/m​[^2]) or is overweight (BMI 25–29 kg/m​[^2]) to lower the risk of CVD.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antihypertensives

Encourage patients with hypertension to purchase a Hypertension Canada–approved BP monitor for home use; suggest a monitoring plan and review these measurements at the medical follow-up. Blood pressure targets for nondiabetic CKD patients should be individualized (see Table 5). In adult patients with diabetes mellitus, the BP target is ≤130/80 mm Hg.​[^[16]] 

Based on the results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), a SBP target <120 mm Hg may be appropriate in patients 50–75 years of age with a 10-year Framingham risk >15% who do not have comorbidities such as diabetes, stroke or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2].​[^[17]] This target also may be appropriate in patients who can achieve it without requiring a high number of antihypertensives and who are not experiencing adverse effects of therapy. 

Patients prescribed ACEI/ARBs or diuretics who are targeting a SBP <120 mm Hg must be reliable and able to hold these medications on sick days when they are unable to maintain adequate fluid intake due to the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

| Patient Type | Systolic Blood Pressure Target |
| --- | --- |
| Meet SPRINT criteria​[a] | <120 mmHg |
| Polycystic kidney disease | <110 mmHg |
| Frail individuals, long-term care residents, previous stroke, limited life expectancy (<3 y), polypharmacy (>5 meds) and standing systolic BP <110 | <140 mmHg |
| Note: Use caution when treating systolic BP to target; risks may outweigh benefits when diastolic BP <60 mm Hg |  |


Table 6 presents guidelines on the choice of antihypertensive agent in CKD.

| Clinical Condition | Antihypertensive |
| --- | --- |
| Diabetic kidney disease(ACR >3 mg/mmol) | ACEI or ARB as initial therapy.For persons in whom combination therapy with an ACEI is being considered, a dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, based on the results of the ACCOMPLISH trial (see Hypertension). |
| Nondiabetic proteinuric CKD (ACR ≥30 mg/mmol or urine protein >500 mg/24 h) | ACEI or ARB.Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics are recommended as additive antihypertensive therapy. For patients with CKD and volume overload, loop diuretics are an alternative. |
| Nondiabetic nonproteinuric CKD (ACR <30 mg/mmol) | Choose agents based on current hypertension guidelines (see Hypertension). |

#### ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred agents for certain types of CKD (see Table 6) because they have the following class effects:​[^[18]]



Increase the ACEI or ARB dose in patients whose BP is above target, and consider increasing in patients with higher levels of proteinuria if BP is within target, although careful follow-up of kidney function and BP will be required.​[^[18]] Moderate to high doses of ACEIs and ARBs have been associated with slowing the progression of CKD.​[^[19]] Begin with low doses and increase at 4- to 6-week intervals while monitoring for adverse effects and hypotension. The dosage range for each ACEI can be found in Hypertension, Table 7.

Measure eGFR and serum K​[^+] prior to and 2 weeks after initiating or increasing the dose of ACEI or ARB. Repeat ACR or PCR in 4–6 weeks.​[^[18]] Suggestions for monitoring and modifying ACEI and ARB therapy are provided in Table 7.

ACEIs/ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy. Counsel premenopausal patients on appropriate contraception (see Contraception). 

ACEIs/ARBs should be held if a patient has severe vomiting, diarrhea or volume depletion, and patients should be made aware of this.​[^[20]]

| Test | Monitoring Frequency | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eGFR | If eGFR ≥60 mL/min, repeat in 4–12 wkIf eGFR 30–59 mL/min, repeat in 2–4 wkIf eGFR <30 mL/min, repeat in ≤2 wk | Dosage adjustment is based on change in eGFR since previous test: eGFR decreased by 0–14%: no dose changeeGFR decreased by 15–29%: no dose change, but repeat eGFR in 10–14 dayseGFR decreased by 30–50%: reduce dose and repeat eGFR every 5–7 days until eGFR within 30% of baselineeGFR decreased by >50%: discontinue ACEI or ARB and repeat eGFR every 5–7 days until eGFR is within 15% of baseline value |
| K​+ | If eGFR ≥60 mL/min, repeat in 4–12 wkIf eGFR 30–59 mL/min, repeat in 2–4 wkIf eGFR <30 mL/min, repeat in ≤2 wk | K​+ 5–6 mmol/L: advise dietary potassium restriction K​+ 6–6.5 mmol/L: prescribe loop diuretic if tolerated ± cation exchange resin |

#### Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are now considered part of standard care in type 2 diabetic CKD.​[^[7]] They are also recommended for adults with CKD and albuminuria (urine ACR ≥20 mg/mmol) or those with heart failure (regardless of albuminuria).​[^[7]] Studies have shown SGLT2 inhibitors significantly slow progression of kidney disease, reduce the need for dialysis or transplantation, and decrease mortality in patients with and without diabetes.​[^[7]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]] When used for patients with type 2 diabetes, the degree of blood glucose lowering diminishes as GFR declines, but the beneficial renal effects are retained (see Figure 3). More recent studies used a lower eGFR cut-off of ≥20 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2] for starting SGLT2 inhibitors and continued until patients reached dialysis or kidney transplantation.​[^[7]]​[^[21]]

The volume status of patients should be assessed prior to starting an SGLT2 inhibitor, and concurrent diuretics may require adjustment. An initial decline of 3–4 mL/min in eGFR is expected; if eGFR declines >20–25%, the medication should be stopped and the patient assessed for acute kidney injury (AKI).​[^[23]] The greatest risk of SGLT2 inhibitor use is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus the risk is estimated to be 0.3–6.3 per 1000 person-years.​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Most patients presenting with euglycemic DKA while taking an SGLT2 inhibitor will do so within 2 months of starting the medication. As well, most patients have a precipitating event, with dehydration, infection, surgery and changes in insulin dose being commonly reported. The incidence of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors is significantly higher in patients with type 1 diabetes; use in these patients is not recommended.​[^[26]] More common adverse effects are genital mycotic infections and urinary tract infections. Keeping the perineal area clean and avoiding use in high-risk individuals, such as those with an indwelling urinary catheter, are risk-reduction strategies.​[^[27]]

Figure 3 suggests a process for initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor and shows the HbA1c reductions that may be expected.

#### Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease

Follow Diabetes Canada guidelines for glycemic targets (see Diabetes Mellitus). 

First-line antihyperglycemic therapies for type 2 diabetes and CKD include metformin plus a SGLT2 inhibitor (see Figure 2). A figure outlining the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes and CKD is found in the online 2022 KDIGO Diabetes Guideline.

Discontinue metformin when ClCr or eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2] due to an increased risk of lactic acidosis.​[^[28]] Metformin should also be discontinued when there are acute decreases in kidney function, and illnesses or procedures that could lead to acute kidney injury (e.g., nausea/vomiting, dehydration, administration of IV contrast dye) or cause hypoxia (e.g., cardiac or respiratory failure), as these also are risk factors for lactic acidosis.​[^[3]] Diabetes Canada suggests medications (see Diabetes Mellitus - Chronic Complications, Table 1), including metformin, that should be held during acute illness.​[^[29]] 

Patients with CKD are at higher risk of developing hypoglycemia because the ability of the kidney to metabolize insulin is impaired. In patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2], emphasize how to recognize and treat hypoglycemia. 

#### Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

**Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** have been shown to improve glycemic control, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. They are recommended in addition to metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor for additional glucose lowering or as an alternative if these medications are not tolerated (see Figure 2).

The FLOW trial published in 2024 was a large (n = 3533) randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing semaglutide 1 mg SC once weekly versus placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes and diagnosed CKD (eGFR 50–75 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2] and ACR 34–565 mg/mmol, or eGFR 25–49 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2]and ACR 11-565 mg/mmol).​[^[30]] Major kidney disease events and the annual rate of eGFR decline was reduced along with a reduction in major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality with semaglutide.​[^[30]]​[^[31]] Over 95% of patients were on a stable, maximally tolerated dose of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor; however, only about 16% of patients were on an SGLT2 inhibitor, and finerenone use was not reported. Although the benefit of combination therapy is theorized to be additive due to their complementary mechanisms of action, this has yet to be studied in a large outcome trial. Randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of combination therapy are anticipated.

The most common side effects associated with semaglutide are nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Hypoglycemia may also occur, especially when used in combination with insulin. Patients with uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy were excluded from the trial, as semaglutide has been associated with increased incidence of diabetic retinopathy complications.​[^[30]]

#### Non-steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

Finerenone is the first non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (nsMRA) approved in Canada. It is indicated in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease, as an adjunct to standard therapy to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease and sustained decrease in eGFR, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and hospitalization for heart failure. Two large randomized placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes demonstrated a reduction in the risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events when added to maximum tolerated ACEI or ARB.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]]​[^[35]] Very few patients were on SGLT2 inhibitors since the trials began before they became standard of care.

Finerenone is recommended in addition to maximum tolerated doses of ACEI or ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease, an eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2], albuminuria (UACR ≥3 mg/mmol) and serum K ≤5 mmol/L. Finerenone may also be considered in patients on ACEI or ARB with albuminuria (UACR ≥3 mg/mmol) who do not tolerate an SGLT2 inhibitor.​[^[35]] Since clinical experience is limited, the manufacturer recommends discontinuing treatment when the eGFR falls below 15 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2].​[^[36]] Finerenone is contraindicated in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) and should not be used in combination with other mineralocorticoid antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone.​[^[36]]

Finerenone can cause hyperkalemia; therefore, routine monitoring of serum potassium is required. Dose adjustments may be needed based on the test results.​[^[7]]​[^[36]]

#### Cardiovascular Risk Reduction for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

Both a reduced eGFR and proteinuria confer substantial increases in progression of CKD, cardiovascular risk and death.​[^[4]]​[^[8]] The prognosis associated with a given level of eGFR varies substantially based on the presence and severity of proteinuria. In fact, patients with heavy proteinuria but with overtly normal eGFR appear to have worse clinical outcomes than those with moderately reduced eGFR without proteinuria.​[^[4]]

#### Lipid-Lowering Agents for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction

Use a statin in patients with CKD who are ≥50 years of age or in those ≥18 years of age with CKD and diabetes, known coronary artery disease, prior stroke or 10-year Framingham risk >10%.​[^[10]] Suggested doses for primary prevention are presented in Table 8. 

In adults with CKD and hypertriglyceridemia, therapeutic lifestyle changes are suggested. Treatment with fibrates is not recommended.​[^[28]]

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Atorvastatin | 20 mg | Pravastatin | 40 mg | Simvastatin | 40 mg |
| Fluvastatin | 80 mg | Rosuvastatin | 10 mg | Simvastatin/Ezetimibe | 20 mg/10 mg |


#### ASA for Primary Cardiovascular Risk Reduction

There is controversy over the use of ASA for primary prevention in patients with CKD. A meta-analysis reported no reductions in CV events or mortality, but major bleeding events were increased, which led to the conclusion that there is no clear benefit of ASA for primary prevention.​[^[38]] The randomized controlled trial data in this area is insufficient to recommend universal use or avoidance of ASA for primary prevention. Current CKD guidelines recommend ASA for patients with known ischemic cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention).​[^[7]]

#### Drug Therapy Adjustment in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

Dosage adjustment of drugs in renal impairment is described in Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment.

Very few drugs are absolutely contraindicated in patients with CKD; however, medications that are generally avoided in patients with stages G4–G5 CKD are listed in Table 9.

| Medication | Complication |
| --- | --- |
| Aluminum-containing medications, e.g., antacids | For short-term use only (≤4 wk) in patients with severe hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphorus >2.23 mmol/L) despite treatment with other nonaluminum phosphate binders. Long-term use associated with aluminum toxicity (e.g., bone disease, dementia). |
| Apixaban | Caution with ClCr 15−24 mL/min; not recommended <15 mL/min. |
| Baclofen | Increased neurotoxicity even at very low doses.​[39] |
| Dabigatran | Not recommended with ClCr <30 mL/min due to increased risk of bleeding. In patients with ClCr 15−29 mL/min, 75 mg BID is suggested, but safety has not been established.​[40]​[41] |
| Edoxaban | Patients with ClCr <30 mL/min were excluded from the venous thromboembolism trials. Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: avoid if ClCr <15 mL/min. |
| Magnesium-containing medications, e.g., antacids, bowel preparations, laxatives | Magnesium accumulation. |
| Meperidine (pethidine) | Accumulation of an active metabolite that can lead to seizures. |
| Metformin | Risk of lactic acidosis with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m​2. |
| Morphine | Accumulation of active metabolites (morphine-3-glucuronide [CNS stimulation/lower seizure threshold], morphine-6-glucuronide [analgesic]) significant in patients with reduced kidney function. Use with caution and at reduced doses. Hydromorphone is preferred. |
| Nitrofurantoin | ClCr <30 mL/min: avoid use as ineffective (not excreted into the urine). |
| NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and other nephrotoxins | Increased risk of acute kidney injury. |
| Phosphorus-containing products, e.g., phosphate enemas | Deaths due to hyperphosphatemia and resulting hypocalcemia have been reported; these products can also cause acute phosphate nephropathy.​[42]​[43] |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics and herbals, e.g., alfalfa, dandelion, noni juice | Risk of hyperkalemia.​[44] |
| Rivaroxaban | Caution with ClCr 15−30mL/min; not recommended <15 mL/min. |
| Sotalol | Risk of accumulation and torsades de pointes.​[45] |
| Vitamin A | Risk of accumulation secondary to decreased renal catabolism and increased serum levels of retinol-binding protein.​[46] |
| Vitamin C | Limit to no more than 60–100 mg/day as the metabolite (oxalate) can result in kidney stones and deposits of calcium oxalate in soft tissues.​[46] |


#### Complications of Chronic Kidney Disease

Complications are seen in stages G3–G5 CKD, and management by a nephrologist is recommended. These complications include:

Anemia: detailed clinical practice guidelines are provided by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes​[^[47]] (see also Common Anemias).

Hyperkalemia: refer to Potassium Disturbances.

Itchy skin: refer to Pruritus.

Metabolic acidosis: treat with sodium bicarbonate tablets or Shohl solution (citric acid/sodium citrate). Titrate the dose to achieve a CO2 level ≥18 mmol/L.​[^[7]] Avoid serum bicarbonate >32 mmol/L as it is associated with increased mortality in patients with CKD.​[^[48]] Monitor closely since some patients will experience fluid retention and heart failure.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart titled "Consideration of SGLT2 inhibitor use in T2D" and outlines the decision-making process for using SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The flowchart is divided into two main pathways based on the intended benefits: cardiorenal benefits and metabolic effects.

### Cardiorenal Benefits Pathway:
1. **Criteria**: For cardiorenal benefits and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73m².
2. **Review Glycemic Control**:
   - If HbA1c < 7% and taking insulin/SU or history of hypoglycemia:
     - Consider reducing insulin by at least 10–20% or reducing SU dose.
     - Start SGLT2 inhibitor once hypoglycemic concern is resolved.
3. **Assess Volume Status and Blood Pressure**:
   - If blood pressure is normal/elevated and clinically euvolemic/hypervolemic:
     - Start SGLT2 inhibition.
     - Continue baseline ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in most patients.
     - Continue diuretics and antihypertensives in most patients.
   - If hypotension and/or volume depletion:
     - Then discontinue concomitant blood pressure, diuretic agents.
     - If euvolemia/normotension is restored, start SGLT2 inhibition.
   - In normotensive, euvolemic patients, consider reducing high-dose loop diuretic by 50% and then up-titrate as required.

### Metabolic Effects Pathway:
1. **Criteria**: For metabolic effects (glycemic control, weight loss).
2. **eGFR Categories**:
   - **eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m²**:
     - Anticipate a 0.7–0.9% reduction in HbA1c and 2–3 kg weight loss.
   - **eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73m²**:
     - Anticipate a 0.3–0.5% reduction in HbA1c and 2 kg weight loss.
   - **eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73m²**:
     - Anticipate no change in HbA1c and 1–2 kg weight loss.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to deciding on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D, considering both cardiorenal and metabolic benefits, and adjusting treatment based on eGFR levels and patient-specific factors.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **sodium bicarbonate** (generics) | Start at 325–500 mg BID or TID. Titrate to achieve an HCO3​- level ≥18 mmol/LMax dose: 5850 mg/day 325 mg tablet = 3.8 mmol bicarbonate500 mg tablet = 5.8 mmol bicarbonateBaking soda dissolved in water may be used as an alternative in patients who cannot take tablets (⅛ teaspoon = 7.1 mmol bicarbonate) | Bloating, flatulence, increased Na​+ absorption. | Reduced absorption of medications requiring an acidic gastric pH, e.g., atazanavir, calcium carbonate, iron tablets, itraconazole, ketoconazole. |
| **citric acid** (Dicitrate Solution, generics) | 1 mmol bicarbonate/mLStart at 0.5 mmol/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses. Titrate to achieve an HCO3​- level ≥18 mmol/L | Bloating, flatulence, increased Na​+ absorption. | Reduced absorption of medications requiring an acidic gastric pH, e.g., atazanavir, calcium carbonate, iron tablets, itraconazole, ketoconazole. |
| **cinacalcet** (Sensipar, generics) | Start at 30 mg PO daily with food. Titrate every 2–4 wk to PTH <53 pmol/L | Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia.Not for use in predialysis CKD. | Cinacalcet strongly inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase levels of metoprolol, flecainide, vinblastine, thioridazine and most tricyclic antidepressants. |
| **semaglutide** (Ozempic) | Initial: 0.25 mg weekly SC for 4 wk; increase to 0.5 mg weekly SC from wk 5 onwardMay increase to 1 mg weekly SC after a further 4 wk | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, injection site reactions, acute pancreatitis (rare). | May reduce rate of absorption of some oral medications. |
| **finerenone** (Kerendia) | If eGFR ≥25 to <60 mL/min/1.73m​2, start at 10 mg PO daily. May increase to 20 mg PO daily in 4 wk if eGFR has not decreased >30%If eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m​2, start at 20 mg PO daily Hold if serum K​+ >5.5 mmol/L | Hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hypotension. | Contraindicated in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, e.g., itraconazole.Avoid combination with inducers of CYP3A4, e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin. |
| **calcium carbonate** (Caltrate, Tums, generics) | Start at 250–500 mg elemental Ca​++/day TID PO with meals. Titrate to achieve a PO4 level in the normal rangeCalcium carbonate is 40% elemental calcium | Constipation and nausea are the most common. Others: hypercalcemia. | Oral iron salts, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and levothyroxine: absorption reduced. Give 2 h before or 4 h after calcium.H2-blockers (e.g., ranitidine), proton pump inhibitors and sodium bicarbonate increase gastric pH and reduce dissolution and phosphate binding of calcium carbonate. |
| **calcium citrate** (generics) | Start at 300–900 mg elemental Ca​++ (1–3 tablets) TID PO with meals. Titrate to achieve a PO4 level in the normal range | Constipation and nausea are the most common. Others: hypercalcemia. | Oral iron salts, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and levothyroxine: absorption reduced. Give 2 h before or 4 h after calcium.H2-blockers (e.g., ranitidine), proton pump inhibitors and sodium bicarbonate increase gastric pH and reduce dissolution and phosphate binding of calcium carbonate.Less dependent on acidic gastric pH for dissolution.May increase absorption of aluminum from aluminum-containing antacids. |
| **lanthanum carbonate** (generics) | Start at 250–500 mg TID PO with meals. May be used in combination with other PO4 binders | Nausea, diarrhea, flatulence. Potential for accumulation of lanthanum due to GI absorption, but long-term clinical consequences unknown. | Reduced absorption of levothyroxine and mycophenolate mofetil. Administer lanthanum 2 h after these drugs. |
| **sevelamer carbonate** (Renvela, generics) | 800–2400 mg TID PO with meals. May be used in combination with other PO4 binders | Heartburn, bloating, gas. | Cholesterol-lowering drugs may need to be reduced, as sevelamer can lower LDL cholesterol by an average of 30%. Reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine and mycophenolate mofetil. Administer sevelamer 2 h after these drugs. |
| **sevelamer hydrochloride** (Renagel) | 800–2400 mg TID PO with meals. May be used in combination with other PO4 binders | Heartburn, bloating, gas. If used alone in patients with nondialysis CKD, monitor CO2 levels as can worsen uremic metabolic acidosis. | Cholesterol-lowering drugs may need to be reduced, as sevelamer can lower LDL cholesterol by an average of 30%. Reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine and mycophenolate mofetil. Administer sevelamer 2 h after these drugs. |
| **sucroferric oxyhydroxide** (Velphoro) | 500–1000 mg TID PO with meals | Diarrhea, nausea, discoloration of stool. | Reduced absorption of other drugs.Administer alendronate and levothyroxine 1 h before sucroferric oxyhydroxide.Administer doxycycline 1 h before or 2 h after sucroferric oxyhydroxide. |
| **canagliflozin** (Invokana) | 100 mg PO once daily | Volume depletion, urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections.In those with T2DM:hypoglycemia, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. | Reassess diuretic dose; consider dose reduction if euvolemic.Reassess sulfonylurea and insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia in those with T2DM. |
| **dapagliflozin** (Forxiga, generics) | 10 mg PO once daily | Volume depletion, urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections.In those with T2DM:hypoglycemia, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. | Reassess diuretic dose; consider dose reduction if euvolemic.Reassess sulfonylurea and insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia in those with T2DM. |
| **empagliflozin** (Jardiance) | 10 mg PO once daily | Volume depletion, urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections.In those with T2DM:hypoglycemia, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. | Reassess diuretic dose; consider dose reduction if euvolemic.Reassess sulfonylurea and insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia in those with T2DM. |
| **alfacalcidol** (One-Alpha, generics) | Start at 0.25 mcg PO every other day or daily. Titrate to PTH <53 pmol/L | Hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia. | Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, thiazide diuretics may reduce levels of alfacalcidol. |
| **calcitriol** (Rocaltrol, Calcitriol-Odan, other generics) | Start at 0.25 mcg PO every other day or daily. Titrate to PTH <53 pmol/L | Hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia. | Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, thiazide diuretics may reduce levels of calcitriol. |
