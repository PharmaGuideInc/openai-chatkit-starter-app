#### Introduction

Constipation is broadly defined as unsatisfactory defecation characterized by infrequent stools, difficult stool passage or both.​[^[1]] On the basis of pathophysiological features, there are 3 primary types of constipation: slow transit constipation, defecatory disorders (pelvic floor dysfunction or dyssynergia) and normal transit (functional) constipation.​[^[2]] Functional constipation may be more precisely defined by the Rome IV criteria as outlined in Table 1.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly the constipation-predominant type (IBS-C), is closely related to functional constipation but with an added component of abdominal pain related to bowel movements (see Irritable Bowel Syndrome).​[^[3]]

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Establishing the potential cause and correcting it are the primary objectives of treatment.

| The presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms for the past 3 months and symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis:Lumpy or hard stools in >25% of defecationsStraining in >25% of defecations<3 spontaneous bowel movements per weekA sensation of incomplete evacuation in >25% of defecationsA sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage in >25% of defecationsManual maneuvers to facilitate >25% of defecations, e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floorLoose stools (including laxative-induced) are not presentCriteria for irritable bowel syndrome are not met |


#### Goals of Therapy

After ruling out “red flag” pathology (see Table 2), the ultimate goal of therapy is to improve the patient’s quality of life.



#### Investigations

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a table illustrating the Bristol Stool Chart, which categorizes stool types based on their form and appearance. It is divided into three columns: "Stool form," "Appearance," and "Type."

1. **Type 1**:
   - **Stool form**: Separate hard lumps like nuts, hard to pass.
   - **Appearance**: Small, round, hard lumps.
   - **Description**: Result of slow transit.

2. **Type 2**:
   - **Stool form**: Sausage-shaped but lumpy.
   - **Appearance**: Larger, lumpy mass.

3. **Type 3**:
   - **Stool form**: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface.
   - **Appearance**: Sausage-shaped with surface cracks.

4. **Type 4**:
   - **Stool form**: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
   - **Appearance**: Smooth, elongated form.

5. **Type 5**:
   - **Stool form**: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges, easy to pass.
   - **Appearance**: Soft, distinct blobs.

6. **Type 6**:
   - **Stool form**: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool.
   - **Appearance**: Fluffy, irregular pieces.

7. **Type 7**:
   - **Stool form**: Watery, no solid pieces.
   - **Appearance**: Completely liquid.
   - **Description**: Result of very fast transit.

This chart is used to help identify different types of bowel movements and can be a useful tool in diagnosing digestive conditions.

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 2 outlines the management of constipation in adults. Nonpharmacologic management is generally attempted prior to initiating pharmacologic therapies.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices







#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 4 details the drugs used in the management of constipation. In general, use drug therapy only when nonpharmacologic approaches have failed. Moreover, continue to reinforce nonpharmacologic therapy when drug therapy is initiated.



#### Management of Opioid-Induced Constipation



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Constipation is a common condition during pregnancy; a greater prevalence is observed during the first 2 trimesters relative to the third trimester and the postpartum period.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] In late pregnancy, constipation is attributed to increased circulating progesterone, which reduces GI motility.​[^[57]] Iron supplementation during pregnancy may also contribute to constipation. Constipation in pregnancy is commonly associated with symptoms of straining, hard stools and incomplete evacuation, but not infrequent defecation.​[^[55]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing a patient who complains of constipation. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Step:**
   - **Patient complains of constipation.**

2. **History and Definition:**
   - **Obtain history to determine usual bowel habits and patient's definition of constipation.**
   - **Decision Point:** Is the patient constipated?
     - **No:** Reassure and educate the patient.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to the next step.

3. **Identify Causes:**
   - **Any identifiable medical condition or drug cause of constipation?**
     - **Yes:** Optimize management of the identified condition or drug cause of constipation.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next step.

4. **Red Flags:**
   - **Any red flags? (see Table 2)**
     - **Yes:** Requires further assessment and treatment.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next step.

5. **IBS-C Criteria:**
   - **Meet IBS-C criteria?**
     - **Yes:** For the treatment of IBS-C, refer to the Compendium of Therapeutic Choices: Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
     - **No:** Proceed to lifestyle modifications.

6. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - **Recommend lifestyle modifications, e.g., increased fluid, exercise, and dietary fiber.**
   - **Decision Point:** Not effective?
     - **Yes:** Check adequate fiber intake.
     - **No:** Continue with lifestyle modifications.

7. **Fiber Intake:**
   - **Adequate fiber intake?**
     - **No:** Use a bulk-forming agent.
     - **Yes:** Trial of osmotic laxative (e.g., lactulose, magnesium citrate, or PEG) for 4–8 weeks + fiber supplement.

8. **Further Steps if Not Effective:**
   - **Not effective?**
     - **Rescue therapy:**
       - Glycerin suppository
       - Stimulant laxative (e.g., bisacodyl)
       - Enema
     - **Trial of linaclotide or prucalopride for 8–12 weeks.**

9. **Final Step:**
   - **Refer for further assessment and treatment if not effective.**

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing constipation, considering lifestyle changes, medication, and further medical evaluation if necessary.
