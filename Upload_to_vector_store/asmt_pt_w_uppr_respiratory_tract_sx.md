#### Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infection is a nonspecific term used to describe a spectrum of acute infections that may involve the ear, nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx and trachea. These infections are common in adults and children and are generally caused by a virus (most commonly rhinovirus, parainfluenza). Most viral infections are self-limiting, resolve spontaneously and are managed symptomatically. Some patients who are at risk of complications of viral infections, including influenza (see Table 1), SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) (see Table 2) and respiratory syncytial virus (see Table 3), may require specific antiviral treatment. Bacterial infections or complications should be medically evaluated to determine the need for antibiotic therapy and further specific intervention. A differential diagnosis of common acute respiratory tract bacterial and viral infections is presented here.

#### Patient Assessment

Viral and bacterial infections can be difficult to differentiate. Signs and symptoms, along with a medical history, can help determine the next steps for assessment and care (see Figure 1). Investigation for possible bacterial infection is indicated in the presence of fever lasting more than 72 hours, high fever, chills, severe sudden throat pain, prolonged congestion (>7 days), difficulty breathing, earache (especially in children) or double sickening (worsening after a few days of initial improvement).​[^[6]] The patient should be assessed for the presence of complications, the level of care required and the need for antibiotics.

See Table 4 for a comparison of common upper respiratory tract ailments.

When patients are afflicted with the common cold, they usually first complain of throat discomfort (dryness, scratchiness), followed by nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Nasal discharge is clear and watery at the beginning and becomes mucopurulent as the infection progresses. Cough may be present and may persist for 1–2 weeks. The cough is usually dry to start and often becomes productive. See also Viral Rhinitis.

With pharyngitis, the onset of throat pain is more rapid and the pain is more severe compared to the common cold. Acute sore throat infections, which include pharyngitis and tonsillitis, are usually viral in nature. However, when additional symptoms include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or rash, streptococcal throat infections should be suspected and treated accordingly. See also Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis and Viral Pharyngitis.

In the vast majority of cases, rhinosinusitis is viral in nature. However, bacterial involvement is suspected if symptoms persist >7 days or if symptoms worsen after initial improvement. Prolonged nasal congestion and purulent drainage are consistent with possible rhinosinusitis, especially if accompanied by fever, headache, facial swelling/redness, facial pain, and nausea and vomiting. See also Acute Rhinosinusitis.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses infections should be considered when patients present with fever, cough, sore throat, anosmia, or shortness of breath or have been exposed to high-risk contacts. Additional symptoms include muscle aches and headaches. The outcomes in affected patients can vary from asymptomatic infections to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is needed when symptoms are consistent with COVID-19 based on local epidemiology. Please consult local health authorities for updated recommendations. See also COVID-19.

Cough is present in most upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and COVID-19. However, it may be caused by other conditions, many of which require diagnosis by an appropriate health-care practitioner (see Acute Cough, Table 1). Cough persisting longer than 3 weeks should be assessed more thoroughly.

 For more detailed information, see also Influenza, Viral Rhinitis, Acute Rhinosinusitis and Viral Pharyngitis.

The supraglottic larynx is a common site for airway obstruction. When infected, it can lead to croup, epiglottitis or supraglottitis mostly in children and rarely in adults. See also Croup. Otitis media can be confirmed on visualization of the middle ear and observation of bulging of the tympanic membrane. See also Acute Otitis Media in Childhood. It can be preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection that usually leads to bacterial involvement. Viral infections will often produce otitis media with effusion that should be differentiated from otitis media alone. The presence and colour of middle ear fluid that is more often dark yellow or red is a sign of otitis media with effusion. Symptoms suggestive of croup, epiglottitis or otitis media (see Table 5) require further assessment for a tailored workup and treatment.

Allergic rhinitis can resemble the common cold but does not have an infectious etiology. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by sneezing and rhinorrhea that may progress to nasal congestion. Eye symptoms such as conjunctivitis and lacrimation may also be present. See Conjunctivitis and Allergic Rhinitis.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for assessing patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

### Initial Assessment
- **Patient presents with upper respiratory tract symptoms.**

### Red Flags Check
- **Are any of the following RED FLAGS present?**
  - Respiratory difficulty: respiratory rate >24 breaths per minute or oxygen saturation <94%
  - Stridor, unusual drooling, severe dysphonia
  - Confusion
  - Lethargy
  - Worsening shortness of breath in chronic diseases (COPD, asthma, heart failure)
  - Severe dehydration

  - **If Yes:** Consider urgent care or emergency room referral.
  - **If No:** Proceed to assess for COVID-19 symptoms.

### COVID-19 Assessment
- **Assess patient for COVID-19 symptoms** (e.g., fever, cough, headache, shortness of breath) and risk factors (e.g., unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, recent high-risk exposure, or close contact with infected person).
  - If COVID-19 is suspected, provide recommendations that follow local public health guidance for diagnosis and ongoing management.
  - If COVID-19 is excluded, continue to the next step.

### Further Symptom Assessment
- **Are any of the following present?**
  - High fever (>40.5°C)
  - Fever >38.5°C for >72 h

  - Chronic respiratory disease (e.g., COPD, asthma)
  - Prolonged nasal congestion (>7 days) with purulent discharge, facial or maxillary pain
  - Cough for >3 weeks
  - Severe throat pain
  - Difficulty and/or painful swallowing
  - Signs of dehydration in an infant (decreased urination, no tears, sunken fontanel)

  - **If Yes:** Requires additional assessment and treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner.
  - **If No:** Continue to assess specific conditions.

### Specific Conditions Assessment
- **Is patient a child with any of the following?**
  - Symptoms consistent with croup or ear infection (see Table 5)
  - Excessive lethargy or irritability
  - Skin rash
  - Cough associated with vomiting

  - **If Yes:** Requires additional assessment and treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner.
  - **If No:** Continue to assess for allergic rhinitis.

- **Are symptoms consistent with allergic rhinitis?** (see Table 4)
  - **If Yes:** See Allergic Rhinitis.
  - **If No:** Continue to assess for influenza or common cold.

- **Are symptoms consistent with influenza or common cold?** (see Table 4)
  - **If Yes:** Assess severity of symptoms.
  - **If No:** Follow other diagnostic pathways.

### Severity and Risk Assessment
- **Are symptoms severe? Has patient's food or fluid intake been significantly reduced (especially important if older adult)?**
  - **If Yes:** Consider need for antivirals and review immunization status.
  - **If No:** Diagnose as common cold or influenza.

- **Is patient at risk of severe influenza complications?** (see Table 1)
  - **If Yes:** Consider need for antivirals and review immunization status.
  - **If No:** Institute nonpharmacologic measures and consider symptomatic treatment.

### Symptomatic Treatment
- **Nasal congestion:**
  - Short-term decongestant in adults.

- **Cough:**
  - Productive: Avoid antitussives.
  - Nonproductive: Consider antitussives.

- **Sore throat:**
  - Consider local treatment and/or systemic analgesics.

- **Fever or myalgias:**
  - Consider systemic antipyretics and/or analgesics.

- **Sneezing or rhinorrhea:**
  - Consider trial of first-generation antihistamine.
