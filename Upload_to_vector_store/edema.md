#### Introduction

Edema is a sign of an underlying disorder that should be investigated and identified. The underlying disorder should be treated prior to or concurrently with initiation of directed therapy for the edema. Edema is caused by an imbalance of fluid homeostasis that leads to increased extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Specifically, it reflects an increase in the major cation (sodium) and anion (chloride) of the ECFV. 

Peripheral edema is swelling in a lower body part (dependent area) that is visible on physical examination. Palpation can differentiate pitting (indentation left when pressure applied) from nonpitting edema. Anasarca is gross, generalized edema. To be visible on the physical exam, the ECFV is increased by many litres. It takes many days for edema to develop when the intake of NaCl exceeds the excretion of NaCl.

Common conditions associated with edema include heart failure (HF); liver failure, including hepatic cirrhosis; and kidney failure, especially nephrotic syndrome. The main focus of this chapter is on the management of peripheral edema. For edema associated with specific conditions, see Heart Failure and Chronic Liver Diseases. 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 suggests a strategy for the management of edema.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Consider if nonpharmacologic actions do not significantly reduce the symptoms related to the edema and if treatment of the underlying disorder has been implemented.

#### Diuretic Therapy

Diuretics decrease sodium reabsorption at various sites in the nephron by interfering with NaCl reabsorption via varied solute transporters, channels and/or pumps.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Diuretics increase sodium chloride and, hence, free water losses; this decreases extracellular fluid volume and improves the edema. Closely monitor for electrolyte imbalances (K​[^+], Cl​[^−], Ca​[^++], Mg​[^++], HCO3​[^−]) and prekidney azotemia (urea, creatinine) to identify and respond to significant alterations.

Peripheral edema, in the absence of respiratory or cardiac compromise (shortness of breath, decreased functional capacity, chest pain), is not life-threatening, and fluid removal must be slow to avoid intravascular volume depletion relative to interstitial fluid. Accurate daily weights are a priority. The maximum recommended rate of weight loss is 1 kg/day if significant peripheral edema is present.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[5]] Diuretics are not effective if daily intake of NaCl is not limited. Diuretics (see Table 1) are also not effective when lymphatic or venous drainage obstruction is the underlying problem. Diuretics should not be prescribed in pregnancy (see Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding).

#### Loop Diuretics

The loop diuretics furosemide, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide and torsemide (not available in Canada) are potent diuretic agents that act in the loop of Henle in the nephron, specifically inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl transporter located at the luminal membrane of the medullary thick ascending limb. The onset and duration of action are short. Loop diuretics are particularly useful in the presence of moderate to severe kidney dysfunction (ClCr ≤50 mL/min). If there is no response with the maximum dose, switching to an alternative loop diuretic is unlikely to improve efficacy.​[^[6]]

Bumetanide and torsemide have no clear advantages over furosemide despite differing sites of metabolism and increased and more predictable bioavailability. Torsemide has a longer half-life, so once daily dosing may be used. Ethacrynic acid is reserved for use in patients with known hypersensitivity to sulfonamide diuretics. There are reports of ototoxicity with all the loop diuretics including ethacrynic acid.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

#### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Spironolactone and eplerenone are steroidal aldosterone receptor antagonists and therefore may be helpful in situations where aldosterone levels are raised. Spironolactone is recommended in patients with hepatic disease, either alone or in combination with furosemide.​[^[7]] Spironolactone or eplerenone is recommended as part of therapy for HF.​[^[8]] Eplerenone is a more selective antagonist for aldosterone with a low affinity for progesterone and androgen receptors. This may result in lower propensity for side effects such as gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction​[^[9]] (see also Heart Failure and Chronic Liver Diseases). Finerenone is a recently approved nonsteroidal aldosterone receptor antagonist that may be useful in CKD patients with HF, especially in diabetic patients.

Amiloride and triamterene are potassium-sparing diuretics that act independently of aldosterone in the collecting duct (direct inhibitors). They are useful in combination therapy with loop diuretics for resistant edema or if hypokalemia complicates the initial diuretic therapy used.​[^[4]]

#### Thiazides

Thiazide diuretics are useful first-line agents if the creatinine clearance is >50 mL/min.​[^[4]] Thiazides work in the distal convoluted tube of the nephron and have a longer duration of action than the loop diuretics. Their specific site of action is the NaCl cotransporter at the luminal membrane of the distal convoluted tubule. They are effective antihypertensive agents and are useful adjuncts to loop diuretic therapy for resistant edema. Hyponatremia, as a complication of diuretic therapy, is more common with thiazide diuretics, perhaps mediated by total body solute depletion.​[^[2]] Alternate thiazides, such as chlorthalidone, may be more potent and act for a longer duration, but have no major clinical advantage over hydrochlorothiazide given in adequate doses in patients with normal kidney function.​[^[4]]​[^[10]]

#### Vasopressin V2–Receptor Antagonists

Tolvaptan is the only selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist (vaptan) available in Canada. Antagonism of vasopressin causes an increase in urine water excretion resulting in increased free water clearance. Use of vaptans should be limited to directed specialist care in cases of volume overload with significant hyponatremia when other measures fail, including the use of urea to augment free water excretion.

#### Management of Resistant Edema









#### Combination Diuretic Therapy



#### Idiopathic Edema



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

 Patients who are pregnant should be referred to a specialist in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Diuretics are usually not recommended in order to avoid intravascular contraction and potential negative effects on placental perfusion. Impairment in placental perfusion and blood flow insufficiency have been implicated in the etiology of gestational preeclampsia. 

Edema is usually self-limiting in postpartum patients. For breastfeeding patients, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can be used, since their transfer into breast milk is very low and no adverse effects have been documented in babies. However, intense diuresis should be avoided as, in theory, diuretics may compromise milk production by depleting intravascular volume.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
