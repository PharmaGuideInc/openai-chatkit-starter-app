#### Introduction

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disorders, typically starting at puberty. There is a high degree of variability in the age of onset, distribution, severity and age of resolution. It may result in disfigurement, scarring and/or emotional distress. Even mild acne can cause major and sometimes permanent psychological disturbance.​[^[1]] Fortunately, acne can be safely and effectively treated.

Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease centred on the pilosebaceous gland of the skin. The understanding of acne pathogenesis is continuing to evolve. Key pathogenic features in the development of acne are follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization with Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), sebum production, and complex inflammatory mechanisms involving both innate and acquired immunity. In addition, studies have suggested that hormones, diet, and genetic and other factors such as impaired skin barrier may contribute to the multifactorial process of acne pathogenesis.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

The above pathogenic features can trigger comedones (pilosebaceous glands that have developed a keratin plug). If the plug is high in the duct, the keratin becomes oxidized, resulting in the appearance of a blackhead or open comedone. When the blockage is deeper, a skin-coloured papule or closed comedone develops. It has been proposed that as these lesions progress, cytokines are released, causing transformation into an inflammatory papule that may develop a central pustule. If this inflammatory lesion ruptures below the dermis, an inflammatory cyst or nodule ensues. These are the lesions most likely to trigger scarring. 

Acne vulgaris is usually classified by the number, type and distribution of acne lesions. Mild acne tends to consist of comedones, a few papules and pustules; moderate acne has several papules, pustules and may contain a few nodules; severe acne has numerous papules, pustules, multiple nodules, cysts and scarring.​[^[5]]

There are many other conditions that can mimic acne, including rosacea, periorificial dermatitis, folliculitis, milia, sebaceous hyperplasia and drug reactions.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The management of acne is primarily pharmacologic. The relationship between diet and acne is controversial. However, there have been studies suggesting an association between acne and high glycemic load diets or dairy ingestion. Dietary changes in isolation, particularly for severe acne, are likely not sufficient to replace pharmacologic management.​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]]

Lack of or improper cleansing is not thought to play a significant role in acne.​[^[9]] One study found that cleansing the skin twice daily may lead to improvement in both open comedones and total non-inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne;​[^[10]] however, a systematic review found that overall the evidence regarding cleansing is limited and of low-quality, making reliable recommendations difficult to formulate.​[^[11]] Cleansing regimens must take patient-related factors such as skin oiliness and sensitivity as well as pharmacological treatments being used, into consideration.

Picking, squeezing or excoriation of inflammatory lesions delays healing and promotes scarring.

Sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light are rarely recommended in view of the risks of photodamage, carcinogenic effects and exacerbation of postinflammatory erythema and hyperpigmentation. High-quality evidence regarding the use of light therapies for acne is lacking.​[^[12]] Various lasers, intense pulsed light, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, photodynamic therapy and comedone extraction are all helpful in certain situations, but can be costly and may need to be administered on an ongoing basis.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Information about pharmacologic choices for acne can be found in Figure 1.

Numerous pharmacologic agents can have a positive effect on acne. It can take 2–3 months to see significant improvement with the use of topical and/or systemic agents. In a patient who has achieved good control with a combination of topical and systemic therapy, consider withdrawal of the systemic agent and maintenance with topical therapy alone.

#### Topical Agents

Information about topical agents for acne can be found in Table 1.

Benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial and mildly comedolytic. Its oxidation of bacterial proteins is not subject to bacterial resistance.​[^[23]] Benzoyl peroxide has the ability to prevent or eliminate C. acnes on the surface of the skin and in the sebaceous follicles.​[^[24]] It is a mild skin irritant and rare allergen. Formulations can bleach clothing. The limited available evidence shows that 2.5% products have efficacy similar to 5% and 10% formulations, but that there is no improvement in irritation-related adverse effects with 2.5% compared with 5% products.​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]

Topical retinoids are the most powerful comedolytic agents, yet they still take months to be effective. They are also effective for inflammatory lesions. Innate differences in efficacy between the topical retinoids appear to be minor, with strength and vehicle used being the most important factors affecting response.​[^[22]] In general, tretinoin is the most cost-effective but also the most photosensitizing, adapalene is the least irritating and tazarotene is the most potent.​[^[22]]​[^[25]] There is currently limited evidence on how trifarotene compares with other retinoids. Apply topical retinoids at a different time of day than benzoyl peroxide (unless combined in a commercial product) to avoid any potential decrease in topical retinoid stability when the 2 drugs are mixed: usually benzoyl peroxide in the morning and retinoid at bedtime.

Of the topical antibiotics, clindamycin is the most commonly used.​[^[13]] When used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, the risk of bacterial resistance is reduced. It is mainly used in papulopustular acne to decrease skin colonization with C. acnes.

Glycolic acid (an alpha-hydroxy acid) is mildly comedolytic and can be used when topical retinoids are not tolerated. At higher concentrations (typically 30–70%), it is used in chemical peels, which are a rapid but irritating method of clearing comedones.

Azelaic acid is comedolytic and antibacterial but does not promote resistant organisms. It is mildly irritating and can reduce hyperpigmentation.

Salicylic acid is comedolytic. Concentrations of 1–2% are tolerated; higher concentrations are usually too irritating. It is most commonly found in nonprescription products.

Dapsone, a synthetic sulfone, is an anti-inflammatory agent effective for acne when given orally, but is not commonly used systemically due to the risk of serious side effects. A topical gel formulation of dapsone is effective for inflammatory acne,​[^[26]]​[^[27]] thus far without the same risks as systemic dapsone.​[^[28]] Topical dapsone may be mildly irritating.

Injection of intralesional corticosteroids (triamcinolone) is a technique that can be used for treatment of the occasional or stubborn nodule or cyst. It can result in rapid improvement and reduced pain. The most common side effect is localized atrophy. It is not appropriate for use in patients with multiple lesions.​[^[2]]

#### Systemic Agents

Information about systemic therapy for acne can be found in Table 2.

Consider systemic therapy when topical therapy has not been effective after 2–3 months, or has only a small chance of success (such as with moderate-severe acne).​[^[35]]

 The tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline and tetracycline) are effective first-line options when systemic antibiotics are indicated (see Figure 1).​[^[2]]​[^[13]] Because minocycline does not appear to be more effective than other systemic therapies,​[^[36]] and is associated with an increased risk of drug-induced lupus or hepatitis, some experts recommend the use of doxycycline or tetracycline over minocycline.​[^[13]] Due to concerns about development of bacterial resistance, use of other effective antibiotics (such as macrolides and sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim) should be reserved for those patients in whom tetracyclines are contraindicated, not tolerated or not effective.​[^[2]]​[^[13]] Evidence regarding duration of use of antibiotics is lacking; recommendations are based on expert opinion. Allow at least 6 weeks to see if an antibiotic is effective. Bacterial resistance can be reduced by using oral antibiotics in combination with benzoyl peroxide.​[^[35]] When possible, limit duration of oral antibiotic therapy to 3 months while maintaining topical therapy. If acne relapses despite appropriate topical therapy, consider alternative systemic therapy. The major concern regarding long-term oral antibiotic therapy remains bacterial resistance; guidelines recommend that systemic antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy.​[^[2]]​[^[13]]

Hormonal therapy for acne is a useful option for females, particularly those who notice a flare of their acne associated with their menstrual cycle. **Oral** contraceptives are effective for the treatment of acne,​[^[37]] and several are indicated for this purpose in Canada (see Table 2). Oral contraceptives with minimal androgenic effects (see Contraception) and those containing the antiandrogens cyproterone **acetate** or drospirenone are especially useful in women with other signs of androgen excess. There is a small risk of venous thromboembolic events with the use of any combined oral contraceptive.​[^[38]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]] This risk is slightly higher with those that contain cyproterone or drospirenone.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] Although there is a lack of good-quality evidence,​[^[42]]​[^[43]] some sources recommend the use of spironolactone as a form of antiandrogenic hormonal therapy in select women based on the evidence that is available combined with experience and expert opinion.​[^[2]] Due to animal data showing feminization of a male fetus early in gestation,​[^[44]] effective contraception is recommended for women of child-bearing age who are taking spironolactone.​[^[2]]

Isotretinoin is a systemic retinoid. It remains the most powerful anti-acne agent, with the majority of patients achieving clearing and sustained remission, even in the most severe cases. It is a well-documented and potent teratogen. Baseline and monthly pregnancy tests must be performed by women of child-bearing age. Women must use 2 reliable methods of contraception until off isotretinoin for 1 month. Evidence of an association between isotretinoin use and psychiatric disorders (including depression and suicidality) is inconclusive given that acne itself is associated with these conditions.​[^[45]] Systematic reviews have found no increased risk of depression (and possibly amelioration of depressive symptoms) with isotretinoin treatment of acne.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] However, it is still prudent to discuss these potential side effects with patients and to consider the risks and benefits of treatment carefully.​[^[45]] Concerns about an association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease have not been confirmed by the available evidence.​[^[48]]​[^[49]]​[^[50]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Acne and Pregnancy

The effect of pregnancy on acne vulgaris is unpredictable. For most women, the changes will be minimal; however, some women's acne flares and some improves. Withdrawal of medications such as oral contraceptives and antibiotics can explain some flares.

#### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

Oral isotretinoin must be stopped at least 1 month prior to becoming pregnant.​[^[51]] Small amounts of isotretinoin are found in semen; however, safety reporting has not indicated any risk of harm to a fetus due to paternal exposure to isotretinoin, and special precautions are not required.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] Men who are still concerned can use condoms or postpone conception until their treatment course is completed. After stopping **oral** contraceptives, women should avoid attempting to conceive until there has been at least 1 spontaneous menstrual cycle. A specific waiting period after stopping spironolactone has not been determined; however, the drug and its active metabolites should be cleared from the body 5 days after discontinuation.​[^[53]] **Tetracyclines** are cleared from the body within 1 week of discontinuation.

#### Management during Pregnancy

Experience with topical use of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin during pregnancy is extensive and both are generally considered safe.​[^[54]] Topical clindamycin is considered safe. Glycolic acid and azelaic acid have low systemic absorption and are unlikely to pose a risk to the fetus.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] Although systemic absorption of topical dapsone appears to be low, safety in pregnancy has not been established.​[^[57]] Safety of topical retinoids (adapalene, tretinoin and tazarotene) has not been sufficiently documented and their use remains contraindicated;​[^[51]] however, 1 meta-analysis showing no major malformations may be reassuring to those experiencing inadvertent exposure during early pregnancy.​[^[58]] Intralesional corticosteroids (e.g., triamcinolone) are not expected to pose a risk to the fetus due to the small dosages used and their limited absorption.​[^[59]] Oral isotretinoin is a well-documented teratogen and must be avoided in pregnancy. Proper use includes ensuring the woman is not pregnant prior to initiation, the use of 2 forms of birth control to prevent pregnancy and regular pregnancy tests.​[^[60]] Erythromycin (with the exception of the estolate salt) is considered safe to use and is the most commonly prescribed oral antibiotic for acne during pregnancy. Tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline are contraindicated, as second- and third-trimester exposure can cause dental staining and enamel hypoplasia in the baby and liver toxicity in the mother.​[^[55]]​[^[61]]​[^[62]] Inadvertent exposure during the first few weeks of pregnancy is unlikely to cause harm.​[^[61]] Tetracyclines can also temporarily inhibit fetal bone development, but the effect is rapidly reversible on discontinuation of the drug and no permanent effects have been observed.​[^[63]]​[^[64]] Avoid sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim, as trimethoprim is associated with antifolate teratogenicity when administered in the first trimester and there are concerns that sulfonamides may increase risk of kernicterus in hyperbilirubinemic neonates if given after 32 weeks of pregnancy,​[^[65]] although 1 systematic review of use near term did not show an association.​[^[66]] Hormonal therapy with spironolactone and **oral** contraceptives is contraindicated.​[^[67]]

#### Management during Breastfeeding

Topical antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, azelaic acid and glycolic acid have minimal systemic absorption and are compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] Systemically administered dapsone is transferred into breast milk:​[^[57]] although systemic absorption of topical dapsone is low and risk to a breastfeeding infant is expected to be minimal,​[^[62]] other topical medications have more evidence of safety. With the use of any topical medication, care should be taken to avoid direct contact of the infant's skin with treated areas of the mother. Minimal amounts of systemically administered isotretinoin are found in breast milk but its safety has not been documented and it remains contraindicated.​[^[55]] Oral erythromycin is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding; although some reports suggest increased risk of infantile pyloric stenosis in the early postnatal period,​[^[55]]​[^[68]]​[^[69]] data is conflicting.​[^[70]] Sulfamethoxazole poses a potential risk of hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)–deficient infants and has been thought to cause bilirubin displacement and kernicterus in stressed neonates and premature infants;​[^[68]]​[^[71]] however, a systematic review concluded that its use in breastfeeding women was not associated with neonatal kernicterus.​[^[66]] Long-term use of trimethoprim may interfere with folate metabolism in the infant. Although the short-term use of tetracyclines (<3 weeks) is not contraindicated during breastfeeding, daily use in acne is not recommended as the absorption of small amounts over a prolonged time could result in dental staining.​[^[68]] Spironolactone is compatible with breastfeeding as minimal amounts are found in breast milk; decreased milk production is unlikely as spironolactone exerts only a mild diuretic effect.​[^[68]]​[^[71]] See Contraception for a discussion of oral contraceptive use while breastfeeding. Progestin-only products may worsen acne.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
