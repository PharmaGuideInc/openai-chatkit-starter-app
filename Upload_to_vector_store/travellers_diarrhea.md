#### Introduction

The incidence of travellersʼ diarrhea (TD) has been decreasing due to improved global sanitation and hygiene; however, it remains a frequent health problem, particularly for travellers from high-income countries who visit low- and middle-income countries.​[^[1]] As the incubation period is short (<2 wk), the incidence rate of TD within the initial 2 weeks of stay determines whether the destination is considered high-risk (>20%), intermediate-risk (8–20%) or low-risk (<8%) for TD. 

Since the clinical course of TD cannot be predicted and reliable medical care is frequently unavailable during travel, travellers may benefit from being prepared to institute self-therapy. Fortunately TD is often self-limited even without therapy, lasting <48 hours in 50% of cases and rarely requiring alteration of travel plans.​[^[1]] An episode of TD does not confer protection against future attacks, and more than one episode can be experienced in a single trip.

TD is defined in Table 1​[^[2]] and the causative pathogens are listed in Table 2.​[^[3]]

| TD is defined as the sudden onset of abnormally loose or liquid frequent stools with functional impact assessed by the patient: |
| --- |
| Mild | Diarrhea is tolerable, not distressing, does not interfere with planned activities. |
| Moderate | Diarrhea is distressing or interferes with planned activities. |
| Severe | Diarrhea is incapacitating or completely prevents planned activities. |
| Dysentery | Passage of grossly bloody stools; all dysentery is considered severe.​[b] |
| Persistent | Diarrhea lasts ≥2 wk. |


| Bacteria​[a] | Virus | Protozoa |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) | norovirus | Giardia |
| Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) | astrovirus | Cryptosporidium |
| Campylobacter | rotavirus |  |
| Salmonella |  |  |
| Shigella |  |  |

#### Prevention of Travellersʼ Diarrhea

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 lists medications used for the prevention and treatment of TD.

#### Bismuth Subsalicylate

Bismuth subsalicylate** (BSS)** has been shown to be effective in preventing TD.​[^[13]] It may have antibacterial activity as well as antisecretory and anti-inflammatory properties. Side effects are minimal with short-term use (<3 wk) at recommended doses. Black stools produced by BSS may create diagnostic confusion by simulating melena. Do not recommend BSS in travellers taking anticoagulants or salicylates or those who are allergic to salicylates. Chemoprophylaxis with BSS is also not recommended for young children due to concerns regarding excessive salicylate absorption and risk of bismuth encephalopathy at higher doses.​[^[14]]

#### Antibiotics

The routine use of **antibiotics** to prevent TD is not recommended due to the risk of adverse events, Clostridioides difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis only for those who are at greatest risk of TD or its complications (e.g., patients who are immunocompromised or have comorbid disease), those who undertake critical travel (e.g., diplomatic missions) or those who have diarrhea every time they travel. When used for prevention of TD, antibiotics should be prescribed for short courses only (<3 wk).​[^[15]]​[^[16]]

Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin) have been shown to reduce the risk of developing TD; however, resistance to fluoroquinolones has increased and geographical patterns of resistance have evolved since the TD-prevention studies were conducted. The efficacy may be lower than previously reported.​[^[17]] Bacterial resistance has severely limited fluoroquinolone use in Southeast Asia including Thailand,​[^[18]]​[^[19]] India,​[^[20]] Nepal​[^[21]] and Indonesia.​[^[22]] Azithromycin may be considered as an alternative to fluoroquinolones but efficacy and safety data for this indication are limited.​[^[6]]​[^[15]]

Rifaximin has been shown to be effective in preventing TD compared with placebo and is recommended by CATMAT for both prevention and treatment; however, the dosage form available in Canada is not appropriate for treatment (see Table 3). Antimicrobial resistance patterns must be monitored.​[^[17]]​[^[23]]

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and doxycycline are no longer recommended for prevention of TD due to significant bacterial resistance.​[^[24]]

#### Vaccines

The inactivated oral cholera vaccine Dukoral contains the nontoxic B subunit of cholera toxin, which has significant homology with the toxin of enterotoxigenic *Escherichia coli* (ETEC) and is approved in Canada for prevention of TD caused by ETEC. A 2013 Cochrane review concluded there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of this vaccine for protecting travellers against ETEC diarrhea,​[^[25]] and the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) advises that the oral cholera vaccine not be routinely administered to Canadian travellers as a means of preventing TD.​[^[6]] CATMAT suggests the vaccine may be considered in short-term travellers at high risk of health complications or serious inconvenience from TD.​[^[6]] The use of this oral vaccine to prevent cholera is not discussed in this chapter; information on cholera prevention may be found in the *Canadian Immunization Guide*.​[^[26]]

#### Probiotics

There is limited evidence to support the use of probiotics to prevent TD. The available data indicate Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii are safe and may provide benefit.​[^[6]]

#### Self-Treatment of Travellersʼ Diarrhea

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 discusses the self-management of TD in adults.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Travellers with mild diarrhea may benefit from a simple diet that maintains hydration, contains a modest amount of sugars and electrolytes, and is devoid of fatty or oily foods and natural laxatives (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excessive fruit). Bananas can replenish mild potassium losses. Dietary fibre may aggravate bloating and cramping.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 lists medications used for the prevention and treatment of TD.

#### Oral Rehydration Therapy

Oral rehydration, especially in infants, pregnant women and the frail elderly, is the cornerstone of all therapy. Commercially available sachets of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), e.g., Gastrolyte, Pedialyte, are dissolved in safe water and the resulting liquid is consumed until thirst is quenched. The traveller should carry sufficient sachets to produce 2–4 litres of oral rehydration solution (ORS). If ORS is unavailable, an emergency substitute can be prepared by adding one-half teaspoonful (2.5 mL) of table salt and 6 teaspoonfuls (30 mL) of sugar to 1 litre of safe water.​[^[6]]​[^[27]] See Dehydration in Children for more information on available oral rehydration solutions.

#### Bismuth Subsalicylate

**Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS)** is considered a safe and effective treatment option for mild TD.​[^[2]]​[^[6]]​[^[28]] It has been shown to modestly reduce the duration of diarrhea and frequency of stools with no serious adverse effects. BSS is not recommended for children <2 years of age or those with an allergy to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).

#### Antimotility Agents

Loperamide provides relief for mild to moderate diarrhea in adults and older children.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] Antimotility agents should not be used in children <2 years of age due to the risk of developing toxic megacolon and obscuring the severity of fluid loss.​[^[6]] The use of antimotility agents alone in patients with bloody diarrhea or fever (temperature >38.5°C) is generally not recommended since the resulting inhibition of peristalsis could, theoretically, prolong the infection and lead to complications; however, evidence is limited.​[^[31]] The combination of loperamide and an antibiotic has been proven safe and more effective than either alone in reducing the duration of diarrhea.​[^[6]]​[^[32]]

#### Antibiotics

Mild diarrhea should be managed with oral rehydration, loperamide and/or bismuth subsalicylate.​[^[6]] If this approach fails or more serious symptoms are present, antibiotics are recommended. To minimize the impact of a potential case of moderate to severe TD, advise patients to obtain a 1- to 3-day supply of antibiotics to take with them on their travels and to initiate therapy if symptoms persist or are severe, especially if diarrhea is associated with blood, cramps or high fever. 

The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and norfloxacin effectively reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea relative to placebo. They are most effective in areas where ETEC is predominant (Latin America and Africa).​[^[6]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]] Campylobacter is often fluoroquinolone-resistant, making **azithromycin** the antibiotic of choice in Asia (particularly Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal and India) where it is a common pathogen.​[^[34]]​[^[35]] Azithromycin has also proven safe and effective for TD acquired in Mexico.​[^[36]]

**Rifaximin** has demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to fluoroquinolones in the treatment of TD; however, this is not currently an approved indication in Canada.​[^[6]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]] Antimicrobial-resistance patterns have been difficult to assess for this agent and require monitoring. Rifaximin is not recommended for treating patients with dysentery.

Clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of a single dose of antibiotic in the treatment of TD (see Table 3 for recommended doses). The addition of loperamide to a single dose of antibiotic may be particularly effective.​[^[40]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]]

Antimicrobial resistance has increased and geographical patterns of resistance have evolved since the studies of treatment of TD were conducted; therefore, the efficacy of the various antibiotics may be lower than previously reported, and future benefit may be further affected. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is no longer recommended for TD due to widespread resistance.

International travel poses a risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing *Enterobacteriaceae* (ESBL-PE), and the use of antibiotics while travelling significantly increases the risk. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 trials found the odds of acquiring ESBL-PE were increased when antibiotics were used during travel (odds ratio 2.37), with fluoroquinolones posing the greatest risk (odds ratio 4.68).​[^[43]] While the clinical implication of MDRO carriage is unclear, the possibility of MDRO should be considered if the traveller presents for medical care in the months post travel. As MDRO may be transmitted to household contacts and medical care settings upon return from travel, and 10% of travellers have been shown to carry MDRO for up to 1 year after return, there is a potential impact to travellers, their households, their communities and global antimicrobial resistance.​[^[2]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]]​[^[46]]

#### Travellersʼ Diarrhea in Children

The management of TD in children and infants is difficult because of the increased risk and rapid onset of severe and life-threatening dehydration, different infectious agents (e.g., rotavirus in children <3 y) and more limited antibiotic choices (e.g., fluoroquinolones are not recommended in children). Parents should be educated on the symptoms of dehydration and the proper use of **oral rehydration therapy** and should be advised to travel with commercial oral rehydration solutions (see Oral Rehydration Therapy) and seek medical help early if their child is affected.​[^[47]]

**Loperamide** is not recommended in children <2 years of age​[^[6]] or in those who are malnourished, moderately or severely dehydrated, or systemically ill, or in those with fever or bloody diarrhea, since adverse events would outweigh benefits.​[^[47]]​[^[48]] Loperamide may be used in travelling children >2 years of age, but data are limited and treatment should not exceed 2 days.​[^[6]] Bismuth subsalicylate is contraindicated in children <2 years of age​[^[6]] and should be used cautiously in older children because of the risks of Reye syndrome.

**Azithromycin** is safe in children and is the antibiotic of choice for childhood TD if antibiotics are deemed necessary.​[^[47]] Ciprofloxacin has been avoided in children because of concern over its potential effects on cartilage development; however, the short courses (1–3 days) used to treat TD may be safe.​[^[49]] Use of TMP/SMX in children is limited by the same resistance problems seen in adults.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Travellersʼ Diarrhea during Pregnancy

The pregnant traveller may be at increased risk of TD and subsequent complications.​[^[50]] Decreased gastric acidity due to commonly used products for pregnancy-related heartburn and reflux may increase the risk of diarrhea. Altered motility may worsen the outcome, and significant volume depletion may precipitate premature labour, placental insufficiency or shock. Early fluid, energy and electrolyte replacement remain the cornerstone of management.​[^[50]]

#### Management

Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended during pregnancy.​[^[50]] Pregnant travellers should pay special attention to safe food and water preparation, which may include travelling with sufficient material to boil water.​[^[50]] Iodine is not recommended as a water disinfectant because of the potential risk of causing thyroid disease in the fetus.

It is prudent for the pregnant traveller to carry adequate supplies of **oral rehydration therapy** and to be familiar with proper use (see Oral Rehydration Therapy). Loperamide is considered safe and can be used when necessary. Azithromycin is considered safe in pregnancy and is the agent of choice if antibiotics are needed.​[^[50]] Bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended because of the risk of bismuth encephalopathy; fluoroquinolones are contraindicated because of the potential risk to the fetus, although the short courses used in management of TD have not been shown to increase teratogenicity.

#### Travellersʼ Diarrhea during Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding should be continued during travel, as it reduces the risk of contaminated food products infecting the infant. Those who are breastfeeding must be meticulous in handwashing and breast hygiene to prevent infecting organisms being passed to the infant.

#### Management

Adequate management of diarrhea during breastfeeding hinges on proper fluid, energy and electrolyte replacement.​[^[51]] **Azithromycin** and loperamide may be used in severe diarrhea.​[^[51]] Iodine for water sterilization, bismuth preparations and fluoroquinolones are best avoided in breastfeeding travellers.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
