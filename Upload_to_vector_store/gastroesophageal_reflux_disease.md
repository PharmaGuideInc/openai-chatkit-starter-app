#### Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common GI complaint reported to physicians. Although acid reflux into the lower esophagus can occur silently, its symptoms range from mild to severe. The severity of symptoms (primarily heartburn and regurgitation) and esophageal mucosal injury generally correlate with the total time the esophageal mucosa is exposed to acid (at pH <4) per 24-hour period.​[^[1]] Mild symptoms do not interfere with daily activity and are usually of low intensity, short duration, not nocturnal, infrequent (<3 times weekly) and without major complications. Severe symptoms regularly interfere with daily activity and are usually of high intensity, persistent (>6 months), nocturnal, frequent and often associated with complications. Dysphagia, defined as difficulty in swallowing, is ominous and necessitates endoscopic evaluation. In contrast, the more common GERD symptom of globus (a continuous feeling of a lump in the throat that does not interfere with swallowing) is a minor feature of acid reflux, does not require investigation and usually responds to effective acid reduction.

The primary basis for reflux is incompetence of the gastroesophageal junction involving the crura of the diaphragm and lower esophageal sphincter (LES), as occurs with a hiatal hernia. Further, pronounced transient relaxations of the LES allow acidic gastric liquid to reflux. GERD can produce esophageal complications (esophagitis, peptic stricture and Barrett esophagus) and oropharyngeal-respiratory problems.​[^[1]] In some 20% of patients, acid-pepsin reflux causes *erosive esophagitis*, which manifests endoscopically as mucosal breaks in the distal esophagus and complications such as ulcer, bleeding or stricture formation. Chronic esophagitis can evolve, through attempted repair, into metaplastic columnar epithelium (Barrett esophagus) and the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Most patients with GERD symptoms have no demonstrable erosive injury on endoscopy, termed *nonerosive reflux disease* (NERD), yet demonstrate abnormal esophageal acid exposure on ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring.​[^[2]] Other patients may experience *functional heartburn* in which the heartburn is not accompanied by any evidence of abnormal acid reflux or esophagitis. Another GERD phenotype is *reflux sensitivity*—physiological reflux episodes that elicit heartburn. Lastly, gastroesophageal reflux may be associated with extraesophageal syndromes such as belching, chronic cough, throat clearing, asthma, laryngitis, oropharyngeal ulceration or dental erosions.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Weight loss, avoiding late evening meals, smoking cessation and elevating the head of the bed were found to be effective in a systematic review of lifestyle interventions.​[^[7]] Additional approaches are supported by evidence for addressing GERD symptoms:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

##### Proton Pump Inhibitors

The PPIs (dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole **magnesium**, pantoprazole **sodium** and rabeprazole) effectively block acid secretion by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium ATPase (the proton pump) on the apical surface of the parietal cell membrane. PPIs are more effective than H2RAs (see Table 1), providing twice the healing rates for esophagitis at standard once-daily doses (up to 90% by 12 weeks) and more successful long-term symptom relief.​[^[14]]

PPIs are prodrugs requiring proton pump activation for optimal efficacy; hence, they are best administered 30 minutes before a meal. Initial therapy should be once daily before a meal (e.g., before breakfast) for a duration of 8 weeks. For those with only a partial response, consider an increase to twice-daily dosing (30–60 minutes before meals) or using a delayed-release formulation (dexlansoprazole). See Management of GERD.

PPIs are the drugs of choice in most GERD patients with or without mucosal injury and for extraesophageal manifestations.​[^[15]] Though PPIs can heal ulceration, they do not reverse epithelial changes in patients with Barrett esophagus. Tachyphylaxis does not develop with continued PPI use. Acid rebound occurs with their discontinuation, likely the basis for symptomatic recurrence when PPIs are withdrawn.​[^[16]]

At equivalent doses, available PPIs offer similar symptom relief, mucosal healing, tolerability and safety (see Table 2).​[^[18]] Apparent differences in bioavailability and antisecretory potency upon initial dosing have no clinical importance in most settings; cost is the major factor to consider when selecting a PPI. Compared with other PPIs, esomeprazole is only slightly more effective in healing erosive esophagitis and relieving GERD symptoms.​[^[19]] Dexlansoprazole (an enantiomer of lansoprazole) uses a delayed-release formulation to prolong the plasma half-life and reduce the duration of acid secretion. Marketed at a higher dose than lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole may offer an advantage over lansoprazole in healing erosive esophagitis.​[^[20]] Less clear is the effectiveness of substituting one PPI for another in patients who have initially responded but then developed further GERD symptoms despite continued treatment.​[^[21]]

The occasional use of a PPI taken “as needed” does not reliably provide adequate acid inhibition and does not produce a consistent or satisfactory clinical response; therefore, a trial at adequate doses is necessary to gauge efficacy (see Table 2 for dosages). GERD symptoms that persist despite adequate PPI therapy are likely due to functional heartburn rather than acid reflux or may represent an overlap with functional dyspepsia. (See Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease).

PPIs are considered safe and well tolerated compared with other medications. Nevertheless, there is growing epidemiological evidence of potentially serious adverse effects with long-term use. Although a clear causal relationship has not always been established, PPIs appear to be associated with a heightened risk of Clostridioides difficile and other enteric bacterial infections,​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]]​[^[3]] community-acquired pneumonia,​[^[3]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]] gastric disease (fundic gland polyposis),​[^[27]]​[^[28]] osteoporosis,​[^[29]]​[^[30]] rare instances of acute hypomagnesemia,​[^[31]]​[^[32]] and perhaps cardiovascular events,​[^[33]]​[^[34]] kidney disease​[^[35]]​[^[36]] and dementia.​[^[37]]​[^[38]]

The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology recommends re-evaluating PPI therapy for GI symptoms on an annual basis through a trial discontinuation or dosage reduction,​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] and the Canadian Deprescribing Network recommends deprescribing PPIs (reducing dose, stopping, or using "on-demand" dosing) in adults who have completed a minimum of 4 weeks of PPI treatment for heartburn or mild to moderate GERD or esophagitis and whose symptoms are resolved.​[^[42]] These recommendations do not apply to patients with Barrett esophagus, severe erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles grade C or D) or GI bleeding; these conditions require long-term maintenance PPI therapy.​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[42]] See Deprescribing for information and resources to support deprescribing PPIs in appropriate patients.

##### Potassium-Competitive Acid Blockers

These potent drugs reversibly suppress acid via blocking potassium from binding to hydrogen-potassium ATPase. Although not yet available in Canada, this class has a rapid onset and is as effective as esomeprazole in healing erosive esophagitis in adults and for improving GERD.​[^[43]]

##### Histamine H2-receptor Antagonists

Cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine and ranitidine are equally effective. Their rapid onset of action makes them attractive for “on-demand” use by some patients with mild GERD (mild symptoms <3 times/week). Bedtime dosing of H2RAs may improve nocturnal reflux symptoms as an adjunct to daytime PPI therapy.​[^[45]] The safety profile of famotidine, nizatidine and ranitidine is excellent; however, cimetidine can elicit reversible impotence and gynecomastia and has pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized through the P450 enzymatic pathway, all of which makes this therapeutic agent less desirable.

This class of drugs is not always effective for esophagitis and should not be used for erosive esophagitis (see Table 1). Twice-daily doses may relieve symptoms in 60% of patients with moderate to severe GERD but H2RAs have limited efficacy in erosive esophagitis. H2RAs are limited by their inability to adequately suppress meal-related acid secretion and by the swift development of tachyphylaxis for maintenance therapy.

Nitrosamine impurities (probable human carcinogens) have been detected in some H2RA products, prompting Health Canada to issue drug recalls and implement enhanced safety measures.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] For the current status, consult Health Canada’s recalls and safety alerts database.

##### Prokinetic Agents

Although the basis for acid reflux is incompetence of the antireflux barrier, impaired esophageal clearance of acid and delayed gastric emptying, no effective motility agent is currently available. The same applies to inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation like GABABagonists.

##### Antacids and Alginates

Antacids like calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide neutralize gastric acid in the lower esophagus and provide rapid relief. Effectiveness is short-term and limited, and they fail to heal esophagitis or prevent GERD complications. Their use is therefore limited to managing mild symptoms.

Alginates are natural polysaccharide polymers that precipitate into a gel with near-neutral pH on contact with gastric acid. This creates a physical barrier that floats upward to displace the acid pocket within the proximal stomach, moving it away from the gastroesophageal junction. The gel then refluxes rather than the acid.

|  | Acute Treatment |  | Drug Class | Symptoms | Esophagitis | Prevention of Recurrences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Antacids | + | – | – |  |  |  |
| Alginates/antacids | + | – | – |  |  |  |
| Histamine H2-receptor antagonists | ++ | + | ± |  |  |  |
| Proton pump inhibitors | +++ | +++ | +++ |  |  |  |


#### Management of GERD

When possible and appropriate, eliminate drugs that impair esophageal motility and lower esophageal sphincter tone, e.g., alpha agonists, anticholinergic agents, beta-adrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers, estrogen, nitrates, opioids, theophylline, tricyclic antidepressants.

#### Trivial to Mild Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Most people with mild symptoms do not seek medical attention and will obtain symptomatic relief with antacids, alginates or H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Additional therapy becomes necessary if these agents fail to sufficiently control symptoms or GERD severity increases (see Figure 1).

#### Moderate to Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

If antacids or H2RAs alone are not effective, or if there is endoscopic evidence of erosive esophagitis, the most effective and common approach is an 8-week course of any of the PPIs.​[^[3]] The goal is to eliminate symptoms, heal erosive esophagitis and prevent complications (see Figure 1).

#### Maintenance Therapy for Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

The recurrence rate following discontinuation of successful therapy is extremely high; almost 100% of patients with erosive esophagitis and 65% with NERD will relapse. PPIs can maintain remission far more effectively than H2RAs and are cost effective.​[^[44]] Maintenance PPI therapy for severe disease is frequently long term and is essential in severe erosive esophagitis and Barrett esophagus.

*Step-down therapy*: Once symptomatic relief has been achieved with full strength PPIs, the intensity of acid suppression is gradually decreased in NERD patients until breakthrough symptoms occur in order to determine the lowest dose that provides symptom relief, e.g., from twice daily to once daily dosing, then to one-half once daily dosing. Some patients can transition to H2RAs once symptomatic relief has been achieved with PPIs without adversely affecting quality of life.​[^[48]] In general, the lowest effective dose should be used to control symptoms and prevent complications (see Table 2).

*On-demand therapy*: On-demand therapy constitutes daily PPI use until resolution of the reflux symptoms is achieved (e.g., 8 wk), followed by discontinuation of the PPI. A subsequent drug-free remission may last for months. Medication is resumed when symptoms recur and is continued until they resolve.​[^[49]] On-demand PPI therapy is an alternative to a continuous maintenance regimen, particularly for those with NERD in whom symptom control is paramount.​[^[50]] In most cases of GERD, continuous PPI therapy provides better symptom control, quality of life and mucosal healing than on-demand therapy.

*As-needed therapy*: Sporadic, as-needed use for short treatment periods (e.g., once or twice weekly) is not suitable for PPI therapy. The response to PPIs does not have a rapid onset; only 30% experience heartburn relief with their first PPI dose.​[^[51]] H2RAs may have a role in as-needed therapy for mild, chronic GERD, although nonpharmacologic measures plus alginates usually suffice in these patients.

#### Management of the Refractory Patient

Despite their potent antisecretory properties, PPIs may not provide symptomatic relief or heal esophagitis; 10–40% of patients with GERD will have continuing symptoms despite standard-dose once-daily PPI therapy.​[^[52]] PPI failure (best defined after twice daily use) may relate to inadequate acid suppression or incorrect diagnosis



PPI therapy should be optimized in terms of adherence and administration (30 min before meals). Double-dosing the PPI (before breakfast and again before dinner) or switching to a delayed-release formulation (dexlansoprazole) for improved 24–hour coverage are common practices;​[^[53]]​[^[54]] further escalation has no value. Another option for refractory GERD, though not completely substantiated, is to switch to a different PPI, as some individuals may be more responsive to one PPI over another.

Acid breakthrough (gastric pH <4) during the night can occur despite twice-daily PPI therapy. Supplementary bedtime H2RA therapy temporarily improves nocturnal GERD. The development of tolerance limits continuous use of H2RAs, which are best employed intermittently or on-demand.​[^[55]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]



#### Procedural Treatments

Failed optimal medical therapy suggests refractory GERD might benefit from a mechanical intervention to restore normal barrier function to the gastroesophageal junction. A meticulous workup is necessary for appropriate patient selection. This should include endoscopy, barium swallow for hiatus hernia, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour esophageal pH and impedance study.​[^[58]] Indications for a procedural intervention include intractable reflux esophagitis despite optimal medical therapy (particularly in a young person), intolerance of PPIs, or complications such as severe erosive esophagitis, stricture formation or recurrent lung disease, e.g., aspiration pneumonia.

Laparoscopic fundoplication, the current surgical standard, wraps the fundus of the stomach around the lower portion of the esophagus and reduces any hiatus hernia, thus strengthening the gastroesophageal barrier. Such surgery effectively controls reflux in well-selected cases; nevertheless, postoperative complaints like dysphagia and the bloat-gas syndrome can arise. Unfortunately, GERD  eventually re-develops in up to one-half of surgical patients. Long-term outcome studies show little difference between surgical and medical treatment.​[^[59]] Drug therapy may even be less expensive than surgery.​[^[60]]​[^[61]]Nevertheless, fundoplication surgery appears superior to medical treatment in those whose reflux-related heartburn is truly unresponsive to twice-daily PPIs.​[^[62]]

A novel endoscopic approach, transoral incisionless fundoplication, creates an esophagogastric wrap around the distal esophagus, anchored by biopolymer devices, aiming to tighten the gastroesophageal junction. Another emerging treatment is magnetic sphincter augmentation in which a ring of titanium magnetic beads is fitted laparoscopically around the lower esophageal sphincter to augment sphincter closure yet allow it to open. The long-term safety and efficacy of these techniques have not yet been established. They are not currently recommended in the management of GERD outside of a clinical trial setting.​[^[63]]​[^[64]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

During pregnancy, progesterone reduces the tone in the lower esophageal sphincter and impairs gastric emptying, while the growing fetus mechanically increases intra-abdominal pressure, acting to increase the risk of gastroesophageal reflux.​[^[65]] GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation and dyspepsia) occur in 30–80% of pregnancies, increasing during the pregnancy and leading to a decreased quality of life.​[^[66]] The risk of GERD increases when heartburn existed before pregnancy and with increasing gestational age and parity. Although the heartburn of pregnancy can be relentless, esophagitis and its complications are infrequent in the absence of pre-existing GERD. Nevertheless, aspiration is a major risk during labour and immediately after delivery, presumably from the mechanical and physiological consequences of the pregnant state, compounded by delivery that entails assumption of a recumbent position or any sedation/anesthesia/intubation. GERD tends to resolve in the puerperium, but often recurs in subsequent pregnancies.​[^[66]]

Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone for treating mild symptoms.​[^[67]] This involves elevating the head of the bed;​[^[11]]​[^[12]] consuming small, frequent meals; and refraining from eating at least 3 hours before bedtime. If this fails, begin nonsystemic drug therapy with antacids. Antacids generally provide immediate relief and are safe for use in pregnancy, with the exception of sodium bicarbonate, which can cause fluid retention and metabolic alkalosis.​[^[68]] Antacids are not concentrated in breast milk and are safe for use when breastfeeding. Alginates are also safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some alginic acid products available outside Canada contain magnesium trisilicate, which can adversely affect the fetus; these should be avoided in pregnancy.​[^[68]]​[^[69]] Sucralfate provides mucosal protection with minimal absorption and may be acceptable during pregnancy and when breastfeeding,​[^[68]] but is not considered effective therapy for GERD in general.

The use of systemic acid-inhibiting drugs represents the next step in more resistant cases, beginning with H2RAs. Ranitidine is effective and safe during pregnancy and when breastfeeding, even with some passage into breast milk.​[^[68]] In more refractory cases, PPIs may become necessary and appear to be safe in pregnancy.​[^[70]]​[^[71]] While evidence of PPI use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited (being primarily from cohort analyses), when considered along with the pharmacokinetics of the PPI class, safety is implied for the fetus and neonate. Additionally, any small passage into breast milk is likely destroyed in the neonate’s stomach through acid hydrolysis. Given the effect of GERD on quality of life and functionality, the use of PPIs should not be overly restricted based solely on pregnancy or breastfeeding. 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
