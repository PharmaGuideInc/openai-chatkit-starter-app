#### Introduction

Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all sleep disorders. Although the term is used in a variety of ways, most often it is defined by an individual’s report of difficulty with sleep.​[^[1]] From a medical perspective, an insomnia diagnosis requires a predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with both sleep quantity and quality. This sleep disturbance occurs at a minimum of 3 nights per week for at least 3 months, is not substance-related or explained by another condition, and results in distress or functional impairment.​[^[2]]

The diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient’s subjective complaints and does not always correlate with objective measures such as sleep architecture, i.e., cyclic phases of REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep, or with a specific number of hours of sleep each night.​[^[3]] For a description of specific types of insomnia disorder, see Table 1.

Apart from insomnia disorder, there are other common sleep-wake disorders that include the following:



#### Pathophysiology

Insomnia is often considered a disorder of hyperarousal in both the central and peripheral (autonomic) nervous systems. Although the term “hyperarousal” is frequently used in the literature, it is not well defined. Some have conceptualized hyperarousal as heightened physiologic, affective or cognitive activity, which interferes with natural “disengagement from the environment” and decreases the likelihood of sleep.​[^[4]] In addition to self-report, hyperarousal can be quantified using measures such as increased cortisol, heart rate variability and EEG. However, determining a threshold to categorize or define hyperarousal is difficult, as all individuals have some level of background arousal present. As such, most studies have identified hyperarousal by noting differences between individuals with insomnia compared to control groups, rather than denoting a specific threshold.

#### Prevalence

Depending on the diagnostic criteria used and population studied, widely variable prevalence rates of insomnia have been reported. In epidemiologic studies assessing insomnia symptoms without restrictive criteria, the prevalence is approximately 22% (95% CI: 17–28%) in the general population.​[^[5]] If more stringent diagnostic criteria are applied, in which the symptoms of insomnia must persist for at least 1 month and not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder, mental disorder or as the direct physiologic effects of a substance or medical condition, the estimated prevalence is approximately 10–13%.​[^[6]]

Insomnia is reportedly more common in elderly patients (particularly those with health problems), in patients with comorbid psychiatric or medical illness, and in women more than men (ratio 1.4:1).​[^[5]]​[^[7]] (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as women or men. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identify of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients*.) Use of certain medications has also been associated with insomnia (see Table 2).

Insomnia is associated with more frequent use of health-care services, more days with limited activity, more days spent in bed, impaired job performance, higher rates of absenteeism, increased risk of traffic and workplace accidents, and reduced quality of life.​[^[8]]​[^[9]] It appears to be a predictor of psychiatric and medical comorbidities including depression,​[^[10]] hypertension,​[^[11]] diabetes​[^[12]] and cardiac events,​[^[13]] all of which contribute to an increase in health-care utilization.​[^[14]] Insomnia may also be a potential indicator of early dementia.​[^[15]] The impact of insomnia on overall health and well-being highlights the importance of making treatment options accessible to affected individuals.

#### Classification

Insomnia is no longer classified as primary or secondary in DSM-5. The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it is an independent condition or a comorbidity with a mental disorder, a medical condition or a different sleep disorder.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] The duration of symptoms can be episodic (1–2 months), persistent (≥3 months) or recurrent (2 or more episodes in a year). 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Specifier | Associated Factors |
| Independent condition(no identifiable medical cause) | Acute emotional or physical discomfort (e.g., acute illness; environmental disturbance such as noise, light or temperature; hospitalization; jet lag; life stress)Acute stressor usually related to work or family life (e.g., death or illness of a loved one, loss of job) |
| Comorbid with a mental health condition | Dementia; eating disorders; mood, anxiety or psychotic disorders; substance-use disorders |
| Comorbid with a medical condition | Cardiovascular disorders (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, untreated hypertension), chronic pain, GI conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease; stomach or gastric ulcer), hormonal changes (e.g., menopause, perimenopause, pregnancy), infection, neurologic conditions (e.g., epilepsy, head injury, Huntington disease, migraine, Parkinson disease), obstructive airway diseases, rheumatic diseases (e.g., arthritis) |
| Comorbid with another sleep disorder | Breathing-related sleep disorder (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hypoapnea, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation), circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (e.g., delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, irregular sleep-wake type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type, shift work type), parasomnias (e.g., non-rapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder, nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, restless legs syndrome) |

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

An assessment plan for patients suffering from insomnia is illustrated in Figure 1.

Table 2 lists medications that have been associated with insomnia.

A sleep diary is the best tool for thoroughly assessing a patient and identifying behaviours/patterns that may be targeted for intervention. For an example of a sleep diary, see Insomnia—What You Need to Know.

| Drug | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol | Acute intoxication may produce increased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams. Alcohol can aggravate breathing-related sleep disorders. With chronic use, alcohol has a short-lived sedative effect for the first half of the night, followed by sleep disruption in the second half. |
| Amphetamines (or other stimulants, e.g., methylphenidate) | Acute intoxication characterized by insomnia, whereas withdrawal results in excessive sleepiness. Drugs like MDMA lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 h of intake. |
| Caffeine | Produces insomnia in a dose-dependent manner. However, it has been reported that evening caffeine use may not be associated with increased insomnia, potentially due to regular use and subsequent tolerance to the effects of caffeine.​[18] |
| Cannabis | Acute use may shorten sleep latency, although arousing effects with increments in sleep latency also occur. In chronic users, tolerance to the sleep-inducing effect develops. Upon withdrawal, sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams may last for several weeks. Health Canada has online form for cannabis ADR reporting. |
| Nicotine | Chronic use associated with symptoms of insomnia, reduced sleep efficiency and increased daytime sleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep. Heavy smokers may have regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving. |
| Opioids | With chronic use, tolerance to the sedative effects develops followed by complaints of insomnia. |
| Sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics (e.g., benzodiazepines) | Acute intoxication produces the expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic use may cause tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia. Sedative-hypnotics can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep apnea events. Parasomnias are associated with benzodiazepines. Abrupt discontinuation of chronic use can lead to withdrawal and rebound insomnia. |
| Other pharmacological agents | Insomnia related to various effects on the central or autonomic nervous system has been reported with:Adrenergic agonists and antagonists (e.g., antihypertensives, bronchodilators) AntihistaminesCholinergic agonists and antagonists Corticosteroids Dopamine agonists and antagonistsHormonal therapy (e.g., anabolic steroids, estrogen, medroxyprogesterone, oral contraceptives, progesterone, thyroid hormone) Serotonergic modulators (e.g., MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs) Smoking cessation agents (e.g., bupropion, varenicline) |

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

A task force appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has reviewed and graded evidence regarding nonpharmacologic therapies for the treatment of chronic insomnia.​[^[19]] Its findings support both psychological and behavioural interventions, with the strongest evidence for cognitive behavioural therapy.​[^[19]] Similarly, a Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) technology review found consistent high- to moderate-quality evidence for nonpharmacological interventions that included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), multicomponent CBT, CBT combined with relaxation therapy, and multicomponent behavioural therapy.​[^[6]] Sleep-restriction therapy, multicomponent therapy (without cognitive therapy), biofeedback and paradoxical intention are also considered effective, but the evidence for their efficacy is not as strong. Sleep hygiene education is recommended as a general measure but has not been shown to be effective as monotherapy in the treatment of insomnia.​[^[20]]

#### Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) consists of any of the recommended behavioural therapies (e.g., stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, sleep restriction) in combination with cognitive procedures, such as identifying dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep and replacing them with a more adaptive substitute. It is aimed at creating a new attitude to minimize anticipatory anxiety and arousal that can interfere with sleep. CBT-I should be offered to all patients, as it has proven to be more effective than medication for the treatment of chronic and persistent insomnia, particularly in long-term maintenance.​[^[21]]​[^[22]] CBT-I has also demonstrated superiority over sleep education therapy in preventing incident and recurrent major depression in nondepressed older adults with insomnia disorder.​[^[23]] The Canadian Toward Optimized Practice (TOP) 2015 guidelines recommend CBT-I as first-line treatment for both acute and chronic insomnia.​[^[24]]

#### Stimulus-Control Therapy

Stimulus-control therapy is based on the concept that sleep is a conditioned response to temporal (bedtime) and environmental cues. The focus of stimulus-control therapy is to eliminate maladaptive behaviours with the overall goal of associating the bedroom with sleep. These measures complement, and are often included in, general sleep hygiene recommendations. Recommend the following to patients:



#### Sleep Hygiene Education

General sleep hygiene education focuses on behavioural and environmental factors that precede sleep and that may interfere with sleep. Stimulus-control therapy is often included in sleep hygiene recommendations (see Stimulus-Control Therapy for more information). Recommend the following to patients:



#### Relaxation Techniques

Relaxation techniques practised at bedtime may improve sleep latency times and sleep maintenance. They may be particularly helpful in cases where hyperarousal is believed to be the cause of insomnia. These techniques include the following:



#### Sleep Restriction

Sleep restriction involves controlling the amount of time spent in bed but increasing the percentage of time asleep. For example, a patient who sleeps for only 6 hours per night but stays in bed for 8 hours would be asked to decrease the time in bed to 7 hours (sleep time, plus 50% of nonsleep time). This would be accomplished by changing the bedtime while maintaining the wake-up time to establish a good sleep-wake cycle. The mild state of intentional sleep deprivation promotes more rapid sleep onset and more efficient sleep. The allowable time in bed is gradually lengthened by 30 minutes as sleep efficiency increases. In a randomized controlled trial, patients with insomnia independent of other specifiers reported improved sleep and reduced fatigue with sleep-restriction therapy.​[^[27]]

#### Paradoxical Intention

Paradoxical intention focuses on removing performance (sleep in this case) anxiety by having the patient partake in their most feared behaviour (remaining awake). In the case of insomnia, patients try to remain awake as long as possible when in bed, with their eyes open and the room darkened. By changing the emphasis from falling asleep to staying awake, the performance anxiety associated with trying to fall asleep slowly disappears.​[^[28]] Advise patients to avoid activities in the bedroom that are incompatible with sleep such as keeping the lights on, reading, watching television or using a computer device with a lighted screen.

#### Multicomponent Therapy

Multicomponent therapy combines several different interventions and may include cognitive, behavioural and sleep hygiene components. 

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Sleep Aid Products. For a description of nonprescription medications for insomnia, see Table 4.

 Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with significant sedative effect,​[^[29]]​[^[30]] is the mainstay of nonprescription pharmacotherapy for insomnia. Evidence for efficacy and safety of over-the-counter antihistamines is limited.​[^[31]]

Principles for nonprescription therapy include:​[^[32]]



 Prescription therapy for insomnia includes primarily benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam)​[^[33]] and nonbenzodiazepine GABA agonists (zolpidem, zopiclone).​[^[31]]​[^[33]] Newer hypnotic drugs include daridorexant, lemborexant, suvorexant and ramelteon (not available in Canada).​[^[31]] Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA agonists may be more efficacious than ramelteon.​[^[33]] Barbiturates and other hypnotics such as chloral hydrate are no longer recommended for the management of insomnia due to an unacceptable risk/benefit profile and rapid development of tolerance, respectively. Antidepressants with sedating effects have been used, particularly in patients with depressive symptoms, but with the exception of **trazodone** and **doxepin**,​[^[24]]​[^[31]] their use solely for insomnia is not generally supported.​[^[34]] Some antidepressants (e.g., reboxetine, vilazodone, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, venlafaxine, sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram) demonstrated higher odds of insomnia than placebo.​[^[35]] Likewise, antiepileptics and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended unless used primarily to treat other conditions.

For further information on prescription therapy, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Insomnia. 

Pharmacotherapy for insomnia, including diphenhydramine, should be recommended with caution, as these agents may be associated with cognitive impairment, increased risk of falls, work-related injuries, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal and rebound effects.​[^[36]] In older people with insomnia, the numbers needed to treat (sleep quality) and harm were 13 and 6, respectively, for all sedative hypnotics combined, indicating an unfavourable risk-to-benefit balance.​[^[37]] Nonbenzodiazepine GABA agonists are also associated with decreased mental alertness and driving impairment the morning after use, despite the patient feeling fully alert.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] Nonpharmacologic treatment of insomnia (e.g., CBT-I) has proven to be a safe and effective alternative to pharmacotherapy and should be considered a first-line treatment option.​[^[21]]​[^[22]] Deprescribing benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA agonists should be considered for appropriate patients, especially older ones.​[^[40]] CBT-I is recommended during and after tapering these medications. For further information on deprescribing, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices:* Deprescribing.

#### Natural Health Products

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Health Products: Combinations, Single Entity; Sleep Aid Products. For a description of nonprescription medications for insomnia, see Table 4.

Valerian (*Valeriana officinalis*) is marketed as a nonprescription therapy for insomnia. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported subjective improvement in sleep quality when outcome was measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e., yes or no).​[^[41]] However, most of the studies had significant problems with methodology and considerable variation in the doses, preparations and treatment lengths. Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported with valerian use.​[^[42]] Valerian is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​[^[43]]

Emerging evidence suggests that medicinal cannabis may improve impaired sleep, but the benefit is likely small and limited by small study populations.​[^[44]]​[^[45]] Medicinal cannabis may be associated with a modest risk of dizziness and a smaller risk of somnolence, dry mouth, fatigue and nausea.​[^[45]] The evidence for the use of cannabis in insomnia is still evolving, and further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks.

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone produced primarily by the pineal gland. Melatonin has been reported to increase total sleep time, relieve or prevent daytime fatigue associated with jet lag, reduce sleep latency, help reset the body’s sleep-wake cycle, and improve overall sleep quality.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] However, the absolute benefit of melatonin compared with placebo may be smaller than other pharmacological treatments for insomnia.​[^[47]] Current guidelines recommend melatonin 2 mg timed-release formulation as a first-line agent for patients over 55 years of age and children, particularly children with sleep-onset insomnia or delayed sleep phase syndrome and learning difficulties, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.​[^[48]] 

L-tryptophan is also available without a prescription at lower doses (<220 mg). L-tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid and precursor for melatonin; it may be beneficial for the treatment of sleep disorders.​[^[49]] Limited evidence supports efficacy at higher doses (1–15 g/day); these doses require a prescription and medical supervision.​[^[50]]

There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of herbals such as German chamomile (*Matricaria recutita*), eleuthero (*Siberian ginseng*), hops (*Humulus lupulus*), lavender (*Lavandula angustifolia*, lemon verbena (*Aloysia citrodora*), passion flower (*Passiflora*), reishi (*Ganoderma lucidum*), St. John’s wort (*Hypericum perforatum*), violet oil (*Viola odorata*) and wild lettuce (*Lactuca virosa*) for insomnia. Kava kava (*Piper methysticum*) may promote sleep but was removed from the Canadian market in 2002 because of reports of hepatotoxicity. 

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 3 provides a framework for a monitoring plan that should be individualized.

Points to cover when counselling patients who choose drug therapy for insomnia: 



| Insomnia Symptoms | Therapeutic Goals | Frequency of Monitoring | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inability to fall asleep | Decrease in sleep latency to ≤30 min | Patient: daily while on drug therapyHealth-care practitioner: after 3 and 7 days of therapy or next visit | If ineffective after 3 evenings of therapy and treatment still required, assess for further therapy or consultation. If drug therapy is required for more than 7 consecutive days, assess for further therapy or consultation. |
| Frequent nocturnal awakenings | Decrease in or no nocturnal awakenings |  |  |
| Early morning awakening | Duration of sleep between 5–7 h per night |  |  |
| Reduced overall quality of sleep | Improved subjective sleep quality with 3 nights of therapy |  |  |
| Therapy Side Effects | Therapeutic Goals | Frequency of Monitoring | Actions |
| Morning drowsiness, grogginess and/or dizziness (elderly are more at risk) | Minimal/acceptable morning drowsiness, grogginess and/or dizziness throughout therapy | Patient or family member: dailyHealth-care practitioner: after 3 and 7 days of therapy or next visit | Decrease dose by 50%.If side effect persists after dosage adjustment and therapy still required, assess for further therapy or consultation. |
| Constipation (adverse effect of diphenhydramine; elderly are more at risk) | Minimal constipation throughout therapy | Patient: every 3 daysHealth-care practitioner: within 1 wk or next visit | Increase dietary fibre, water intake and exercise. If no improvement in bowel function, recommend a laxative. Discontinue therapy if constipation persists. |
| Confusion(adverse effect of diphenhydramine; elderly are more at risk) | No confusion throughout therapy | Family: dailyHealth-care practitioner: within 1 wk or next visit | Discontinue therapy immediately and assess for further therapy or consultation. |

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart designed to assess and manage insomnia in patients. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Assess patient's symptoms: daytime impact of sleeping problem, early and/or frequent awakening, sleep latency, total sleep time.

2. **Underlying Causes of Insomnia:**
   - Questions to assess:
     - Are symptoms associated with shift work?
     - Does the patient have an urge to move their legs at night or complain of unpleasant leg sensations?
     - Does the patient snore, snort/gasp, or experience breathing pauses during sleep?
     - Does the patient have an irrepressible need to sleep, fall asleep, or nap within the same day?
     - Does the patient sleepwalk or complain of sleep terrors or nightmares?
     - Are symptoms possibly due to drugs? (Refer to Table 2)

3. **If Yes to Underlying Causes:**
   - Refer to appropriate healthcare practitioner.
   - Determine whether the patient may benefit from changes to drug therapy.
   - Counsel regarding CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia).
   - Ask the patient to keep a sleep diary.

4. **If No to Underlying Causes:**
   - Assess the duration of symptoms.

5. **Duration of Symptoms:**
   - **Transient (<3 days):**
     - Usually self-limiting upon resolution of acute stressor.
     - Recommend good sleep hygiene practices.
     - If insomnia occurs in a predictable pattern, consider short-term drug therapy (2–3 nights only) (see Table 4).

   - **Short Term (3 days–3 weeks) or Chronic (>3 weeks):**
     - Assess sleep hygiene and patient's expectations from therapy.
     - Recommend CBT-I.
     - Recommend nonprescription drug therapy; consider contraindications, previous effectiveness, toxicity in drug selection (see Table 4).
     - If nonprescription sedative is ineffective after 3 nights or required >7 consecutive days, the patient may need prescription therapy or other management strategies.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing insomnia, emphasizing the importance of identifying underlying causes and considering both behavioral and pharmacological interventions.
