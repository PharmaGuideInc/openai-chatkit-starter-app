#### Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder defined only by its symptoms, which include the presence of abdominal pain associated with defecation and altered bowel habits at the exclusion of an organic cause.​[^[1]] Patients with IBS may experience diarrhea, constipation or both, with frequency determining the IBS subtype. In most patients, symptoms may fluctuate over time and thus migrate between different IBS subtypes.​[^[2]] 

The pathophysiology of IBS is not well understood, and is likely multifactorial. Classified as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, there is evidence that the pathogenesis may include inflammatory, environmental, psychological and dietary factors as well as alterations of intestinal microbiota.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Since there are no known biomarkers for IBS, the diagnosis is clinical.

IBS is a common condition with an estimated prevalence of 12% in North America, where symptoms are 1.5 to 2 times more frequent among females than males.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Although only some patients with IBS seek medical care,​[^[7]] it is the 4​[^th] most expensive digestive disease in Canada with an estimated economic and health-care burden exceeding $6.5 billion per year.​[^[8]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a diagram illustrating the Bristol Stool Chart and its relation to different types of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Here's a detailed description:

### Bristol Stool Chart Types:
- **Type 1**: Separate hard lumps, like nuts.
- **Type 2**: Sausage-shaped but lumpy.
- **Type 3**: Like a sausage but with cracks on the surface.
- **Type 4**: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
- **Type 5**: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges.
- **Type 6**: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool.
- **Type 7**: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid.

### Graph Description:
- **Axes**:
  - **Y-axis**: % Bowel movement hard or lumpy (0 to 100).
  - **X-axis**: % Bowel movement loose or watery (0 to 100).

### IBS Types and Their Locations on the Graph:
- **IBS-C (Constipation)**: High % of hard or lumpy stools (Bristol types 1 or 2).
- **IBS-D (Diarrhea)**: High % of loose or watery stools (Bristol types 6 or 7).
- **IBS-M (Mixed)**: Both hard/lumpy and loose/watery stools (Types 1 and 2 plus 6 and 7).
- **IBS-U (Unsubtyped)**: Low % of both hard/lumpy and loose/watery stools.

### Additional Notes:
- The graph is divided into quadrants to show the prevalence of different stool types in relation to IBS subtypes.
- The vertical dashed line at 25% separates the predominance of hard/lumpy from loose/watery stools.
- The horizontal dashed line at 25% separates the different IBS types based on stool consistency.

This diagram helps in understanding the classification of IBS based on stool consistency and frequency.

#### Therapeutic Choices

There are different approaches for the management of IBS patients, which involve nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies; a stepwise management approach is usually advocated for IBS patients. Nonpharmacologic therapies are sufficient for some, while other patients who have moderate to severe symptoms may not be satisfied with this approach and may require pharmacologic therapies.​[^[12]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

A good physician-patient relationship can have a positive impact on the quality of life of a patient with IBS.​[^[13]] Patient education is central to management and includes discussions that may include education regarding diagnosis and prognosis as well as the acknowledgement of any fears; providing reassurance may help patients with long-term coping and making sense of symptoms. The more time that is spent at this early stage in establishing a strong patient-physician relationship, the greater the chance of finding an effective management strategy.​[^[12]] A multidisciplinary approach to treatment (e.g., including a pharmacist, psychologist and dietician) is suggested in the treatment of IBS. Nonpharmacologic treatment options for IBS are outlined in Figure 2.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a circular flowchart focused on patient education and management strategies. At the center is "Patient education," which is highlighted as a central component. Surrounding this central element are five interconnected components, each in its own box, forming a cycle:

1. **Diet**: Includes specifics such as "GFD, low FODMAPs, elimination and fibre."
2. **Probiotics**: Listed as a component without additional details.
3. **Psychological therapies**: Listed as a component without additional details.
4. **Lifestyle interventions**: Includes "exercise, caffeine, alcohol."
5. **Prebiotics**: Listed as a component without additional details.

An arrow indicates the cyclical nature of these components, suggesting an ongoing process or interaction among them. The flowchart emphasizes the integration of these elements in patient education and management.

fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols

#### Lifestyle Interventions

Lifestyle interventions include promoting increased physical activity and encouraging patient to reduce consumption of alcohol and caffeine. 



#### Dietary Interventions

Patients with IBS often report worsening of symptoms after the ingestion of certain food components. Indeed, more than 60% of patients with IBS relate the occurrence of bloating and abdominal pain to the ingestion of certain foods, such as wheat and fermentable carbohydrates.​[^[17]]



#### Modification of Gut Microflora



#### Psychological Treatment

Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnosis and mindfulness-based therapies have been designed and implemented effectively in IBS.​[^[34]] Although it is not often incorporated into routine practice, CBT has been the most widely studied psychotherapy and it is currently recommended as a first-line treatment for IBS. A prospective study comparing standard CBT with home-based CBT demonstrated that minimal-contact CBT combined with self-guided therapy provided greater improvement in GI symptoms at 2 weeks sustained and over the 12 month follow-up period.​[^[35]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Therapies that have been evaluated in high-quality randomized controlled trials would be the therapy of choice for IBS patients. However, the evidence supporting the use of many available treatments for IBS is poor with no long-term data.​[^[12]] When nonpharmacologic recommendations fail, pharmacologic therapies in IBS should be initiated, with therapy chosen depending on the IBS subtype and predominant symptoms. For pharmacologic treatment options see Table 4.

#### IBS-Diarrhea Predominant



#### IBS-Mixed Pattern



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

IBS and pregnancy are independent; there is no evidence that one affects the other. A prominent feature of IBS is its unpredictable, chronic and relapsing nature. Therefore, in a patient with IBS, pregnancy may be accompanied with worsened, improved or unchanged IBS symptoms. IBS does not contraindicate pregnancy, nor are there any precautions beyond those recommended above prior to pregnancy. Management of IBS during pregnancy or breastfeeding entails addressing the symptoms when necessary. In principle, no drug should be used unless absolutely necessary and only then after all nondrug therapies have been tried.

For the treatment of diarrhea, **calcium polycarbophil** and psyllium are unabsorbed and safe and compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding. Colesevelam may be used for diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption during pregnancy when benefits exceed risks; supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins are recommended due to reduced absorption.​[^[51]] Although loperamide has not been associated with teratogenic effects, its safe use during pregnancy has not been established. Small amounts of loperamide are transferred to breast milk but is unlikely to affect the breastfeeding infant.​[^[52]] **Diphenoxylate with atropine** should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding since it has been found to be teratogenic in animals and its active metabolite is probably transferred to breast milk.​[^[53]] There is insufficient safety data evaluating the use of eluxadoline and rifaximin during pregnancy and lactation.​[^[54]]​[^[55]]

Encourage nonpharmacologic treatment options for constipation due to IBS during pregnancy; options include adequate hydration, exercise and increased dietary fibre. Because they are not systemically absorbed, bulk-forming agents such as psyllium are considered first-line in pregnancy while stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl may be recommended for short-term use; all options are compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[52]]​[^[56]] The use of linaclotide, prucalopride, pinaverium or trimebutine during pregnancy or breastfeeding are not recommended based on insufficient human safety data.​[^[55]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[59]] Dicyclomine has been used safely during pregnancy but studies evaluating use during breastfeeding are lacking.​[^[55]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
