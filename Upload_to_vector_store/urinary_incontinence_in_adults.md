CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “male” and “female” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be broadly described as relating to storage dysfunction or voiding dysfunction. In Canada, 29% of older females and 5% of older males report LUTS.​[^[1]] Urinary incontinence (UI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine.​[^[2]] The most common types of UI are stress, urgency, overflow and functional. Differentiating the type of incontinence is necessary, as each has a unique treatment approach.

Stress incontinence is the most common form of incontinence reported in Canada, accounting for 55.3% of UI.​[^[3]] In female patients, it is a result of weakened pelvic floor muscles—reduced pelvic floor muscle strength causes urethral and bladder-neck mobility, resulting in urethral sphincter incompetence. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., “stress” from laughing, coughing, exercise, abdominal obesity) increases pressure inside the bladder that overcomes the ability of the compromised urethral sphincter to close the urethra, and urine leakage results. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency is a less common form of stress incontinence and may result from pelvic or other bladder surgery or irradiation, a vaginal birth or a neurological disorder.

Urgency incontinence is reported in 22.4% of Canadian adults​[^[3]] and usually involves leakage of moderate to large amounts of urine due to inability to delay voiding when an urge is perceived. Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome that often leads to urgency incontinence, although some individuals with OAB experience only an urgency to void and can toilet quickly enough to avoid incontinence. Causes of urgency incontinence include detrusor (bladder wall muscle) hyperactivity or instability and CNS disorders (e.g., parkinsonism, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis).

Mixed incontinence includes features of both stress and urgency incontinence and is reported in 17.3% of adults in Canada.​[^[3]]

Overflow incontinence occurs when there is leakage of urine due to a distended bladder, commonly referred to as chronic retention of urine. This can occur due to detrusor underactivity (“underactive bladder”), which can include neurogenic bladder (disorder or problem with the nerve control of continence and voiding function, e.g., as a result of diabetes or stroke), or bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia). Overflow incontinence most commonly occurs in males and results in dribbling, hesitancy and poor urine flow. Between 10–41% of males ≥40 years of age report having severe LUTS due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).​[^[4]]

Functional incontinence is the loss of urine caused by the inability to mobilize to or use the toilet and does not involve changes in the lower urinary tract. Causes include physical constraints (e.g., restricted mobility, difficulty removing clothing), cognitive factors (e.g., depression, neurocognitive disorder [dementia]) and environmental barriers (e.g., access to toilet, positioning). Treatment focuses on optimizing the underlying condition or functional status and does not involve intervention for the urinary tract. As such, it is beyond the scope of this content and is not addressed.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



Other screening questions have been used by experts and can be integrated into a clinician’s history and review for the patient. Some of these questions include:​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]]



Most people find urinary incontinence to be distressing but the extent of bother can be measured to determine the degree of distress and to establish a baseline, if needed. For example, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) has a series of validated questionnaires that are publicly available and can be selected based on sex, type of UI or other patient features. Other tools used in practice and research include the Bladder Self-Assessment Questionnaire (B-SAQ), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and Urogenital Distress Inventory.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

If the patient does have urinary incontinence, review for modifiable risk factors (see Table 1) and proceed with further assessment including a thorough history with attention to:​[^[10]]​[^[12]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

#### Stress Incontinence

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 outlines the management of urinary incontinence in adults and Table 2 details the medications available for the treatment of stress incontinence in females.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions are first line for stress incontinence after secondary causes have been ruled out or treated.​[^[16]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]] Most evidence with stress incontinence is from studies in females although there is some research in males who have had pelvic surgery.​[^[12]]



#### Pharmacologic Choices

The drugs used in the management of stress incontinence in females are detailed in Table 2.

Vaginal estrogen therapy has been studied but the overall supporting evidence is weak and the benefit is not clinically significant.​[^[44]] However, vaginal estrogen therapy may be considered in select cases if the postmenopausal patient is diagnosed with mixed urinary incontinence and vaginal atrophy.​[^[45]] Vaginal estrogen may also be used in patients prescribed pessaries to strengthen the vagina to improve stability and comfort.​[^[45]]​[^[46]] There is no need for a progestogen with the use of vaginal estrogen therapy. Systemic estrogen therapy (transdermal or oral administration) does not offer benefits and may worsen symptoms of UI.​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]] See Menopause for detailed information on estrogen therapy.

Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is indicated in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety and pain but was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for stress UI. There is evidence that duloxetine decreases the rate of UI and improves quality-of-life scores​[^[49]]​[^[50]] and there is evidence that patients who have prostate surgery may also benefit from duloxetine.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] In studies of patients with depression, duloxetine was associated with an increased risk of suicide; it is unclear whether this risk applies to patients without depression. A meta-analysis of data submitted to the EMA found the effect sizes of benefits were small and did not outweigh the potential risks, consistent with other evidence showing frequent discontinuation due to side effects.​[^[52]]​[^[53]] However, the NICE guidelines from the UK support offering duloxetine to females with stress UI if surgical treatment is not appropriate, emphasizing that patients must be counselled about adverse effects prior to starting therapy.​[^[45]]

#### Urgency Incontinence

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 outlines the management of urinary incontinence in adults and Table 3 details the medications available for the treatment of urgency incontinence.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

When secondary causes have been ruled out or treated, initiate conservative management/behavioural therapy:​[^[16]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Drugs used in the management of urgency incontinence are detailed in Table 3.

Antimuscarinics (darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium) are considered second-line treatment for urgency incontinence when nonpharmacologic options fail to provide adequate symptomatic relief.​[^[56]] These medications have been shown to provide short-term improvement in OAB symptoms and enhance quality of life.​[^[71]]​[^[72]]​[^[73]] However, the medications are not curative and the benefit for patients may not be acceptable given the side effects.​[^[74]] They can be combined with nonpharmacologic therapies for added benefit.​[^[71]]​[^[75]] Antimuscarinic therapy should be continued for at least 4–8 weeks to determine benefit.​[^[63]] Discontinuing therapy should be considered at the 8-week point if there is no benefit or if the side effects are not tolerable for the patient.

Anticholinergic effects can occur with antimuscarinic products; they are of greater concern in older adults and often lead to early discontinuation of therapy.​[^[76]]​[^[77]]​[^[78]] To minimize side effects, start at a low dose and titrate slowly. Vigilant monitoring is required when using antimuscarinic medications in older adults since these patients are more susceptible to their adverse effects. More selective agents (darifenacin, solifenacin, trospium) demonstrate reduced side effects compared with traditional anticholinergic therapy and may improve adherence.​[^[79]]​[^[80]]

Safety concerns were initially thought to be reversible with medication discontinuation; however, increased risk of dementia as a result of cumulative anticholinergic effects has led to debate about the use of antimuscarinics, particularly in older adults.​[^[62]]​[^[81]]​[^[82]]​[^[83]]

Systemic **estrogens** do not have a place in therapy in the treatment of postmenopausal urgency incontinence and may actually worsen incontinence.​[^[48]]​[^[57]] Vaginal estrogen for females with postmenopausal urogenital atrophy may be an option as an adjunct to behavioural or pharmacologic treatment (see Table 2).​[^[45]]​[^[84]]​[^[85]]

Mirabegron is a beta3-adrenergic agonist indicated for the treatment of urgency incontinence. Mirabegron has been studied in both males and females and, compared with placebo, is effective in reducing the number of urgency incontinence episodes by about 1/day.​[^[86]]​[^[87]]​[^[88]]​[^[89]]​[^[90]] Mirabegron is better tolerated than antimuscarinic therapy and may result in improved adherence.​[^[91]] This may be the reason some experts recommend mirabegron prior to antimuscarinic therapy, particularly in frail, older adults or those with cognitive impairment, although further research is required.​[^[92]]​[^[93]]​[^[94]]

Intravesicular **botulinum toxin (**onabotulinumtoxinA**)** is approved for use in Canada for refractory overactive bladder and in neurogenic detrusor overactivity (e.g,. spinal cord injury). Botulinum toxin (BTXA) is administered via cystoscopy, which is invasive and performed in hospital or specialized clinics. BTXA decreases urgency incontinence and has demonstrated improvement in quality of life and reduced frequency of incontinence episodes.​[^[95]]​[^[96]]​[^[97]] BTXA has evidence showing consistent benefits over 3 years of follow-up.​[^[98]] The most common complication is UTI; patients also report dysuria and there is a risk for urinary retention.​[^[56]]

#### Mixed Incontinence

#### Therapeutic Choices

Treat patients with mixed UI for the predominant symptom (e.g., stress or urgency symptoms).​[^[62]]​[^[63]]​[^[99]]​[^[100]]

#### Overflow Incontinence

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Chronic retention of urine due to detrusor underactivity is poorly responsive to pharmacologic therapy. A systematic review found inconsistent evidence for parasympathomimetics for urinary retention but overall very poor tolerance due to GI upset, blurred vision, bronchospasm and bradycardia.​[^[103]] Other medications that can be tried include alpha-adrenergic antagonists and prostaglandins.​[^[99]] For management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, see Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Urinary Incontinence during Pregnancy

Urinary incontinence before pregnancy is extremely rare; the peripartum period is when patients tend to experience UI for the first time.​[^[104]] Stress UI is the most common type during pregnancy (63%), and this is associated with an increased risk of experiencing stress UI after pregnancy.​[^[104]] Urgency and frequency increase from the first to third trimester,​[^[104]]​[^[105]] with reported rates of incontinence up to 74% by week 36.​[^[106]]​[^[107]] Stress incontinence is believed to develop in pregnancy as the result of a combination of physiological changes, such as hormonal changes and weight gain by the pregnant patient, uterus and fetus, which results in reduced strength of the pelvic floor muscles and increased pressure on the bladder.​[^[106]]​[^[108]] Risk factors associated with urinary incontinence during pregnancy include advanced maternal age and higher BMI.​[^[105]]​[^[109]]

Many patients report a resolution of urinary symptoms after delivery. However, pregnancy increases the prevalence of long-term stress incontinence and nocturia, especially in those who have had >1 child.​[^[104]] The hypothesized mechanism is damage to the urinary tract, pelvic floor musculature or nervous system from the birth. Episiotomy, operative vaginal delivery, exposure to oxytocin in labour or vaginal delivery of an infant weighing >4 kg increase the risk of subsequent pelvic floor dysfunction.​[^[110]]​[^[111]]

#### Management

The emphasis in pregnancy is on preventative measures, with PFMT found to be effective when implemented during pregnancy.​[^[105]]​[^[106]]​[^[112]] Interventions to reduce time in labour and device-assisted delivery (e.g., use of forceps), avoid episiotomy, or consider Cesarean section may reduce the risk of subsequent UI, but the evidence is scant.​[^[105]]​[^[113]]​[^[114]]

Treatment of urinary incontinence during pregnancy involves pelvic floor rehabilitation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that incontinence could be prevented by starting pelvic floor muscle strengthening during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period. Patients may be referred to a physiotherapist or participate in a home-based exercise program.​[^[106]]​[^[112]]​[^[115]]​[^[116]]​[^[117]]

#### Urinary Incontinence during Breastfeeding

Many patients will have resolution of urinary symptoms postdelivery. However, if pelvic floor injury occurs, symptoms may persist. While disruptive for the patient, this condition does not significantly impact the nursing child. Fluid restriction has been studied and there may be improvements with reducing daytime fluid intake 25%, but this has not been studied in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding,​[^[68]] and reducing fluid intake could negatively impact milk production.

#### Management

The recommendations for management of postpartum urinary incontinence primarily focus on pelvic floor rehabilitation.​[^[26]]​[^[105]]​[^[106]]​[^[112]]​[^[115]]​[^[116]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for managing a patient presenting with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). Here is a detailed description of its contents:

### Initial Steps:
- **Patient presents with LUTS**
  - Confirm symptom characteristics
  - Gather medical history: use of containment products, previous treatments, comorbidities, surgeries, medications, lifestyle factors
  - Order laboratory tests: urinalysis, Post-Void Residual (PVR)
  - Request patient complete bladder diary for 3 days

### Decision Point:
- **LUTS related to incontinence**
  - Perform 3 Incontinence Questionnaire (3IQ)
  
  #### Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UI):
  - Bladder training
  - Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises (PFME)
  - Weight loss as needed (PRN)
  - Smoking cessation PRN
  - Caffeine reduction PRN
  - Fluid redistribution or restriction PRN
  - Biofeedback training
  - Medications:
    - Antimuscarinic (usually first line)
    - Mirabegron
    - Vaginal estrogen if postmenopausal urogenital atrophy
    - Botulinum toxin
  - Inadequate response: Refer for other diagnostic tests and surgical options

  #### Mixed UI:
  - Treat first based on predominant symptom: urgency UI or stress UI

  #### Stress UI:
  - PFME
  - Weight loss PRN
  - Consider referral for Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
  - Medications:
    - Vaginal pessaries
    - Vaginal estrogen
    - Duloxetine
  - Inadequate response: Refer for other diagnostic tests and surgical options

- **LUTS related to other cause**
  - Treat cause/condition found according to respective guidelines or refer if necessary
  - If PVR > 150 mL, consider assessment for retention
  - If urinalysis positive for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), treat appropriately
  - If urinalysis positive for glucose, screen for Diabetes Mellitus (DM)
  - Refer for further urologic/gynecologic assessment if:
    - Pelvic prolapse
    - Pelvic pain
    - Recurrent UTIs
    - Hematuria
    - Possible obstruction (e.g., Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - BPH)
    - Significant PVR
    - Neurologic condition

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing LUTS, distinguishing between incontinence-related and other causes, and outlining specific treatment and referral pathways.
