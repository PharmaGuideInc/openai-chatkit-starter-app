#### Introduction

Chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections are a challenge to the public health system in Canada and around the globe. Chronic viral hepatitis is defined by the presence of virus in the blood 6 months after infection; specifically, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) confirms chronic hepatitis B infection and presence of both hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) and HCV RNA confirms chronic hepatitis C infection.​[^[1]] Patients diagnosed with hepatitis B or C generally require referral to specialists with expertise in the treatment of viral hepatitis and the management of liver disease; however, with the advent of new oral therapy for hepatitis C, treatment of noncomplicated patients can be safely provided by other health-care providers in primary care settings.

If untreated, chronic viral hepatitis may lead to the development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensation with end-stage liver disease requiring transplantation. Although chronic hepatitis D (delta hepatitis) is uncommon in Canada, persons co-infected with both B and D viruses generally have more severe liver disease and worse clinical outcomes than those who are infected with a single type.

Hepatitis E, although usually an acute illness, may lead to chronic hepatitis in patients who are immunocompromised, e.g., post-transplant.​[^[2]] Management of chronic hepatitis E will not be addressed in this chapter.

This chapter focuses on:



#### Goals of Therapy

#### General



#### Specific



#### Chronic Hepatitis B

#### Introduction

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes chronic in 90% of infected infants, 25–50% of infected children <5 years of age and 5–10% of infected teenagers or adults.​[^[5]] Among those with chronic hepatitis B, about 0.5–0.8% will show HBsAg loss spontaneously each year and they may or may not develop anti-HBs (become immune).​[^[6]] HBsAg clearance is the most desirable event and deemed a “functional cure.”

HCC can occur with or without cirrhosis in individuals with HBV. Chronic HBV infection can cause, although rare, a spectrum of immune complex–mediated conditions including glomerulonephritis and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Early diagnosis is therefore important.

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Hepatitis B cannot be cured; the goals of pharmacologic interventions are to control disease by complete suppression of HBV DNA, and thereby halt disease progression and lower HCC risk. Oral antiviral therapy is also used prophylactically to avoid HBV reactivation in persons with resolved hepatitis B (either spontaneously or from treatment) who are undergoing immunosuppression. All HBsAg+ individuals may require prophylaxis if not already on treatment.

Table 1 summarizes the recommended management of chronic hepatitis B based on patient characteristics and the results of HBV serum markers. Table 2 lists the medications used in the management of chronic hepatitis B.

#### Peginterferon alfa-2a

Peginterferon alfa-2a is used mainly to treat patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B who persistently have lower HBV DNA levels and elevated serum aminotransferase values. Its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects promote seroconversion from an HBeAg-positive to an anti-HBe-positive state, which is associated with normalization of serum aminotransferases. In a small proportion of patients, HBsAg is also lost.

Do not use peginterferon alfa-2a in decompensated cirrhosis because of the increased risk of life-threatening infections and possible worsening of hepatic decompensation.​[^[8]] HIV-positive and other immunosuppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B respond poorly to peginterferon alfa-2a.

#### Nucleos(t)ide Analogues

Nucleoside analogues include lamivudine and entecavir, and the nucleotide analogues include adefovir (rarely used), tenofovir** disoproxil fumarate** (TDF) and tenofovir** alafenamide** (TAF). Of these agents, TDF, TAF and entecavir are first-line therapies based on efficacy, safety, development of viral resistance and tolerability. They effectively inhibit replication of HBV in patients who are HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative and should be given to patients who have ongoing hepatitis (persistent ALT and HBV DNA elevations) or to patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies as prophylaxis. Inhibition of HBV replication with these agents is associated with significant reductions in hepatic necroinflammation, increased rates of HBe seroconversion and a reduced risk of developing HCC.​[^[9]]

Resistance to nucleos(t)ide analogues is no longer a concern with first-line therapies. Entecavir, TDF and TAF are associated with no or very low rates of antiviral resistance even after years of therapy.​[^[10]]​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

Lamivudine is not a first-line therapy due to its low potency in reducing HBV DNA and high resistance rate (up to 70% after 5 y of therapy). It continues to be used, primarily as prophylaxis, to prevent disease reactivation in patients on immunosuppressive therapy who are HBsAg-negative, but anti-HBc-positive (positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen), i.e., have had past exposure to HBV.

TDF is active against HIV and HBV, including lamivudine-resistant HBV. It has been approved as monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B, based on studies in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative adults.​[^[13]] It has also been studied in patients with HIV-HBV co-infection receiving combination antiretroviral regimens.

Similar to TDF, TAF is a prodrug of tenofovir diphosphate and is active against both HIV and HBV, including lamivudine-resistant HBV. TAF produces higher levels of tenofovir diphosphate in cells than TDF and therefore can be administered in a lower dose, which translates to lower toxicity potential. It has been approved as monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B, based on studies in both treatment naïve and experienced adults who were HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative.​[^[12]]

#### Chronic Hepatitis C

#### Introduction

About 75–85% of acute HCV infections in adults become chronic (the rate is somewhat lower in children).​[^[14]]​[^[15]] HCV is acquired most frequently through illicit drug use (e.g., snorting cocaine, injecting drugs), blood transfusion (prior to 1992), tattooing and needle-stick injuries. Risk factors for progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C include male gender, being >40 years of age at acquisition, duration of infection, alcohol consumption >50 g daily, co-infection with HIV, immune suppression, diabetes and higher BMI.​[^[16]]

The Canadian Liver Foundation, in line with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations in the United States,​[^[17]]​[^[18]] recommends one-time HCV testing for all persons born between 1945 and 1975 irrespective of their risk factors.​[^[19]] The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends testing only those patients with identified risk factors,​[^[20]] and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against screening for HCV in adults who are not at elevated risk of infection.​[^[21]] The 2018 Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver HCV guidelines strongly support birth cohort screening.​[^[4]]

#### Investigations



Prior to starting treatment, HCV RNA viral load and genotyping is usually performed and hepatic fibrosis stage is assessed (via liver biopsy or noninvasive tests-such as APRI, Fib4 or FibroScan). With the advent of pangenotypic DAAs, some jurisdictions and payers no longer require genotyping to move forward with treatment. Although all HCV-infected individuals should be considered for treatment, it is imperative that those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3 and F4 on the Metavir scale or >9 kPa on FibroScan) receive treatment in a timely fashion. Patients exhibiting features of decompensation should be treated in conjunction with a hepatologist.

All patients who complete treatment must return 12–24 weeks after completion of therapy for an HCV RNA test to determine sustained virologic response (SVR) status. An SVR constitutes a cure (clearance of viral infection); however, reinfection with the same or a different HCV genotype may occur if the patient engages in high-risk behaviour.

SVR is durable and is associated with clinically significant outcomes, including improvements in liver histology and health-related quality of life and reductions in liver-related morbidity and mortality.​[^[28]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

With the advent of all-oral antiviral therapy, called direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, the treatment milieu for HCV changed rapidly and dramatically. The limitations and complexities that existed with the utilization of pegylated interferon, ribavirin and first-generation protease inhibitors no longer exist. Genotype and fibrosis levels are less impactful on outcomes of treatment, although caution is still warranted in patients with decompensated liver disease. HCV can now be effectively managed in the primary care setting, allowing the large number of undiagnosed and untreated patients to receive appropriate, safe and relatively quick care. Recommendations for testing, managing and treating HCV infection can be found at www.hcvguidelines.org.

The pharmacologic agents discussed in this chapter are those presently available and utilized in Canada for the treatment of HCV. There are now regimens available for all genotypes, disease levels and prior treatment-experience statuses, with cure rates exceeding >90%.​[^[23]] Populations once considered high risk or untreatable are now eligible for treatment with these safer regimens.​[^[24]] A small number of patients will exhibit resistance-associated variants.​[^[25]] Resistance testing is available and can be utilized when considering choice of agents.​[^[26]] Retreatment options now exist for those patients with prior DAA treatment failure.​[^[27]]

The HCV genome encodes both structural (S) and non structural (NS) proteins. Current DAAs were developed targeting the NS proteins that are important for viral replication and were classified based on the mechanisms they use against the virus. There are 3 classes of DAAs: NS5B polymerase inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors and NS3/4A protease inhibitors. An overview of the properties of these antiviral agents used for chronic hepatitis C is provided in Table 3.

#### NS5B Polymerase Inhibitors

In Canada, sofosbuvir is the only available nucleoside inhibitor of HCV polymerase (the enzyme mediating HCV RNA replication; also commonly known as NS5B). Sofosbuvir is used in combination with other antiviral agents in the treatment of HCV, generally ledipasvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir.

Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate. Potent Pgp inducers, e.g., rifampin, should not be coadministered with sofosbuvir-based therapies, as a decrease in sofosbuvir plasma concentration may occur, leading to reduced therapeutic effect and potential loss of virologic response. Of note, severe bradycardia has been reported with the concurrent use of sofosbuvir, NS5A inhibitors and amiodarone. Pgp inhibitors may be coadministered with sofosbuvir or ledipasvir.​[^[29]]

#### NS5A Inhibitors

The HCV NS5A inhibitors used in Canada are ledipasvir, pibrentasvir and velpatasvir. These agents are utilized in combination with other drugs (see Table 2).

The NS5A inhibitors are substrates of Pgp and, apart from ledipasvir, all are substrates of CYP3A4. Drug interactions are minimal in this class apart from some statins, antituberculosis medications and HIV regimens. Ledipasvir and velpatasvir require acid for optimal absorption; use of proton pump inhibitors or antacids must be evaluated.​[^[24]]

#### Protease Inhibitors or NS3 Inhibitors

The protease inhibitors (PIs) in use today are glecaprevir and voxilaprevir. PIs are now used in combination with polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. The first-generation PIs boceprevir, simeprevir and telaprevir are no longer utilized for treatment of HCV.

PIs are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4; therefore, substantial potential for drug-drug interactions exists. A review of drug interactions is required prior to initiating therapy.​[^[24]] Moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 should not be used concurrently with PIs.

#### Ribavirin

Ribavirin is an antiviral medication and should be used only in combination with other agents for the treatment of HCV.​[^[30]]

#### Combination Therapies

Standard therapies for HCV are now all-oral and combine various HCV NS5B, NS5A and protease inhibitors. In certain populations, ribavirin may be added. These combinations are generally referred to by the brand names Epclusa, Harvoni, Maviret and Vosevi. Some remain genotype-specific, while others are pangenotypic. The cost of all these agents is considered significant (see Table 3). Prior to initiating any DAA therapy, a thorough medication history, including nonprescription and natural products, should be conducted and potential drug interactions carefully assessed. The University of Liverpool provides a comprehensive drug interaction tool that is available on its website (HEP Drug Interactions) and as an app for mobile devices (Liverpool HEP iChart).
