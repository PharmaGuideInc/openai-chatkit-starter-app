#### Introduction

Contraception is an important health issue for many individuals during their reproductive years, which, in individuals with a uterus, spans at least 3 decades from puberty to menopause. It is estimated that nearly 50% of all pregnancies in Canada are unintended, with associated direct costs to the health-care system of over $320 million;​[^[1]] in 2021, there were a total of 367 684 births,​[^[2]] and in 2020, 74 155 induced abortions.​[^[3]] Unplanned pregnancies have been associated with negative health and social outcomes for both the pregnant individuals and the children.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]



This data is in alignment with previous statistics indicating a continued need for contraceptive counselling and enhanced public education at a young age.​[^[8]]

Health-care practitioners are the best suited to help patients with their contraceptive choices, taking into consideration desired outcomes as well as advantages and disadvantages of various methods.

This chapter focuses on nonhormonal contraceptive methods. For a review of hormonal and intrauterine contraceptive methods or emergency contraception, see Contraception.

#### Pathophysiology

The reproductive cycle comprises 2 main phases: the follicular or preovulatory phase and the luteal or postovulatory phase. The first day of menses marks the beginning of the follicular phase, during which follicle-stimulating hormone promotes the maturation of several ovarian follicles. After about 7 days, 1 follicle dominates and development of the other follicles stops. As the dominant follicle continues to grow, estrogen levels increase and the follicle develops luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors. The estrogen causes proliferation of the endometrial lining, and at midcycle stimulates the pituitary gland to release a surge of LH. This LH surge causes final maturation of the follicle and the release of the ovum into the fallopian tube. 

Release of the ovum from the follicle marks the beginning of the luteal phase. Once the follicle ruptures and releases the ovum, the remaining cells of the follicle become the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone causes secretory changes to the endometrium, which are necessary for implantation. If conception occurs, the corpus luteum continues to maintain the hormone production necessary for the early stages of pregnancy. If the ovum is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates and levels of estrogen and progesterone drop quickly. This fall in hormones causes menses and the cycle starts over again.​[^[9]]

The luteal phase lasts 14 ± 2 days and is the more consistent of the 2 phases. The follicular phase can vary by several days, making it difficult to predict when ovulation will occur. The usual menstrual cycle lasts 28 days; however, it can vary from 25–35 days.​[^[9]]

Some physical changes that accompany the hormonal changes (e.g., basal body temperature, cervical mucus) may be monitored by the patient. During the follicular phase, the basal temperature is stable. There is a slight drop in basal temperature about 12–24 hours before ovulation, followed by a sharp rise in temperature due to the progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation. Three days of sustained elevated temperature suggests that ovulation has likely occurred, and the postovulation infertile time has started.

Cervical mucus is almost nonexistent after menses. During the follicular phase, it is opaque, white or yellowish in colour, viscous and sticky. The mucus increases in volume and takes on the appearance of uncooked egg whites (clear, thin and stretchable) as ovulation approaches. After ovulation, the mucus becomes opaque and viscous until menses. Changes in cervical mucus are the result of an increase in estrogen. Around the time of ovulation, the character of the mucus provides a favourable environment for sperm.​[^[10]]

 Conception can only occur within a restricted timeframe of the menstrual cycle, primarily due to the brief viability of sperm within the reproductive tract (up to 5 days) and the limited duration of oocyte survival after ovulation (from 12–24 hours). As a result, the window of fertility spans from 5 days prior to ovulation to 1 day afterward, with the greatest likelihood of conception within 2 days preceding ovulation.​[^[11]] If pregnancy is not desired, it is important that an effective method of birth control is used, especially during the most fertile days of the cycle.

#### Natural Family Planning

SeeTable 1 for a summary of the failure rates, advantages and disadvantages of each natural and barrier method of contraception.

| Method | Details | FailureCorrect and Consistent Use​[a] | FailureTypical Use​[b] | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Abstinence | Avoidance of vaginal intercourse. | Theoretically: 0% | No data for typical use | No costNo device or pharmacologic agent requiredMay be supported by religious organizations | Can be challenging over time as it requires high levels of self-control and excellent communicationMust be fully committedNo protection from HIV or other STI transmission through other forms of intercourse (e.g., oral, anal) |

| FABM, Calendar Method, standard days | Counting begins on the first day of the cycle (day 1 of menses). Vaginal intercourse should be abstained from or another contraceptive method should be used from days 8–19. Colour-coded strands of beads, called Cycle Beads, or smartphone/online apps may be used to help keep track of the days of the menstrual cycle.​[10]​[14] | 4.8–5%​[c] | 8–25% | No pharmacologic agent requiredPatient’s knowledge of menstrual cycle is increased and can be used to determine fertile period to aid conception, if desiredMay be supported by religious organizations | Should be combined with abstinence or other contraceptive method during the high fertility periodContinuous charting and monitoring requiredSeveral months may be required to gain understanding of fertility signsCan be used only by those who have regular cycles of 26–32 days in durationNo protection from HIV or other STI transmissionIf apps are used, privacy may be breached if data is collected and shared with other parties, see Electronic Applications (apps) |
| FABM,Rhythm | The length of the cycle is recorded for at least 6 months. By then subtracting 20 from the length of the shortest cycle and 10 from the length of the longest cycle, one can identify the earliest and latest day during which fertility is most likely to occur in the next cycle. See Table 2 for different examples. | 0.1–9%​[c] | 25% | No pharmacologic agent requiredPatient’s knowledge of menstrual cycle is increased and can be used to determine fertile period to aid conception, if desiredMay be supported by religious organizations | Should be combined with abstinence or other contraceptive method during the high fertility periodContinuous charting and monitoring requiredSeveral months may be required to gain understanding of fertility signsCan be used only by those who have regular cycles of 26–32 days in durationNo protection from HIV or other STI transmissionIf apps are used, privacy may be breached if data is collected and shared with other parties, see Electronic Applications (apps) |
| FABM,Basal body temperature | The temperature is taken orally, rectally or vaginally before the person rises for the day using a BBT thermometer, at the same time and by the same route each day. The person should avoid speaking, eating, drinking or smoking before taking a reading.Abstinence or another form of contraception should be used from the start of the menstrual cycle until after experiencing 3 consecutive days of elevated temperature (0.5°C).​[15] | 1%​[c] | No data for typical use | No pharmacologic agent requiredPatient’s knowledge of menstrual cycle is increased and can be used to determine fertile period to aid conception, if desiredMay be supported by religious organizationsDigital basal thermometer only device required | Should be combined with abstinence or other contraceptive method during the high fertility periodContinuous charting and monitoring requiredSeveral months may be required to gain understanding of fertility signsCan be used only by those who have regular cycles of 26–32 days in durationNo protection from HIV or other STI transmissionIf apps are used, privacy may be breached if data is collected and shared with other parties, see Electronic Applications (apps)Temperature may be affected by illness, infection or jet lagIdentifies the end of the fertile period only; use with another method to calculate start of fertile period​[11] |

#### Fertility Awareness–Based Methods

Fertility awareness–based methods (FABMs) of contraception are methods that rely on the physical signs that vary throughout a patient’s menstrual cycle in response to hormonal changes, such as changes in cervical secretions or basal body temperature.​[^[11]] Patients can monitor these signs and symptoms and predict when they are most likely to be fertile. Pregnancy is prevented by abstaining from vaginal intercourse or by using a barrier method of contraception during the time of highest fertility.​[^[32]] Natural family planning refers to the use of the FABMs as the only method of contraception.​[^[11]]

These methods can also be used for natural family planning to improve the chances of conception by those hoping to conceive.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example 1 | 28 | 32 | 28–20 = 8 | 32–10 = 22 | 8–22 |
| Example 2 | 25 | 30 | 25–20 = 5 | 30–10 = 20 | 5–20 |


#### Electronic Applications (apps)

Computer- and smartphone-based apps have grown exponentially in health care over the past decade. There are many apps available that are related to contraception and fertility awareness, which intend to replace traditional paper and pencil-based tracking methods. Apps are available that mimic natural nonhormonal contraceptive methods such as the calendar, symptothermal or ovulation prediction methods. There are also apps available to assist patients who elect to use hormonal contraceptives, such as the oral contraceptive pill or ring, to remain adherent to drug therapy by providing reminders.

Patients value apps that are accurate and based on scientific evidence.​[^[33]] While there are many fertility and menstruation tracking apps, there is little discussion surrounding the regulation of such apps. In addition, studies show that health professionals are rarely involved in the design, development or deployment of these apps.​[^[34]] However, users should be advised that privacy may be breached if data is collected and shared with other parties.

The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved or allowed the marketing of apps for contraceptive use including *Natural Cycles* and *Clue Birth Control*.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Health Canada has a process for licensing software as a medical device; however, no contraceptive apps are currently listed.​[^[37]]

#### Diaphragm

![](images/contraceptionpsc_dia.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration showing the use of a diaphragm, a barrier method of contraception. 

- **Anatomical Context**: The illustration depicts a cross-section of the female pelvic area.
- **Diaphragm Placement**: The diaphragm is shown inserted into the vagina, covering the cervix. It is positioned to prevent sperm from entering the uterus.
- **Structure**: The diaphragm is a dome-shaped, flexible device that fits snugly over the cervix.
- **Additional Element**: There is a separate illustration of the diaphragm outside the body, showing its shape and structure.

This image is used to demonstrate the correct placement and function of a diaphragm as a contraceptive device.

*AI-generated description for accessibility and content understanding*


A diaphragm is a small, reusable, soft silicone dome with a covered flexible spring at the outer edge that is inserted into the vagina (see Figure 1). Proper use of the diaphragm creates a barrier at the cervix and prevents sperm from entering the uterus, reducing the chance of pregnancy. Diaphragms are intended to be used with a gel that traditionally contains nonoxynol-9 **(N-9)**.​[^[23]] Alternatively, acid-buffering gels can be used with a diaphragm; these gels form a physical barrier and lower the pH, reducing sperm motility (see Spermicides).​[^[32]]

The diaphragm must be inserted prior to vaginal intercourse and should stay in place for at least 6 hours afterwards, but it must be removed within 24 hours to reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome. To apply the gel, the diaphragm is held dome-side down (like a cup) and approximately 1 teaspoonful of gel squeezed into the dome. A little of the gel is applied to the rim of the diaphragm with a finger. To insert the diaphragm, it must first be folded and then inserted into the vaginal canal. The diaphragm is pushed along the back of the vagina as far as it will go. The front rim is tucked up along the roof of the vagina behind the pubic bone and the back rim of the diaphragm is below and behind the cervix. This is usually done with the patient standing with 1 foot propped up, squatting or lying on the back. When the diaphragm is properly in place (see Figure 1), the patient wearing it should not feel it. The tension between the diaphragm and vaginal wall holds the diaphragm in place. If vaginal intercourse has not occurred within 2 hours of insertion of the diaphragm, more gel should be added.​[^[31]]​[^[32]] An additional application of gel is required with each repeated act of vaginal intercourse but must be applied using an applicator, without removing the diaphragm.​[^[29]]​[^[32]]

The diaphragm can be removed by hooking the index finger behind the front rim and pulling down and out. Alternatively, the patient can assume a squatting position and push downward with the abdominal muscles (bearing down as one would for a bowel movement). Once removed, it should be washed with mild soap and water, rinsed, dried with a towel and stored in its container.​[^[26]]​[^[29]]

**Contragel Green** is a jelly distributed in Canada as an acid-buffering barrier gel. It contains a combination of ingredients including lactic acid, sodium lactate, methylcellulose and sorbic acid. **Caya Diaphragm Gel**, similar to Contragel, is also approved for sale in Canada as an acid-buffering barrier gel. The methylcellulose forms a physical barrier, while some evidence suggests that lactic acid reduces the pH of the vagina, limiting sperm motility.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] These gels are not intended to be used alone but rather in combination with barrier methods such as diaphragms.​[^[40]]

Diaphragms require individual fitting and annual checks. In Canada, the availability of diaphragms is extremely limited and few professionals are left who have adequate training to fit them.

**Cervical caps** are no longer available in Canada, but may still be available in other countries.

#### Internal (Female) Condom

![](images/contraceptionpsc_femcon.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical illustration showing a sagittal section of the female pelvic anatomy. It includes the following structures:

1. **Uterus**: Positioned centrally, with a curved shape, indicating its typical position in the pelvis.
2. **Vagina**: Extends downward from the uterus, showing its connection to the external body.
3. **Bladder**: Located anteriorly (in front of) to the uterus, demonstrating its proximity to the reproductive organs.
4. **Rectum**: Positioned posteriorly (behind) the uterus, illustrating its location in relation to the other pelvic structures.

The illustration provides a clear view of the spatial relationships between these organs within the female pelvis. There are no labels or additional annotations in the image.

The vaginal or internal condom (branded as FC2) is a single-use barrier contraceptive that protects against pregnancy as well as against HIV and other STI transmission (see Figure 2). The vaginal condom is a pouch coated with a silicone-based nonspermicidal lubricant with rings at each end to help keep the condom in place within the vagina. The closed end is inserted into the vagina and covers the cervix. The ring on this end helps anchor it in place like a diaphragm. The open end hangs out of the vagina. The ring on the open end is placed against the body and helps prevent the condom from entering the vagina. Inserting the condom a few minutes before vaginal intercourse and/or adding extra lubricant may reduce the noise, but it can be inserted up to 8 hours prior.​[^[32]] After intercourse, the condom should be twisted to seal in the semen and then gently removed and discarded. A new condom must be used after each ejaculation.​[^[23]] Internal and external condoms (also known as vaginal and penile condoms) should not be used concurrently.

#### External (Male) Condom

![](images/contraceptionpsc_malcon.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a line drawing illustrating a medical examination technique known as the "skin turgor test." It shows two hands performing the test on a section of skin, likely on the back of a hand or forearm.

- **Left Hand**: The thumb and index finger are pinching and lifting a fold of skin.
- **Right Hand**: The thumb and index finger are also involved in pinching and lifting the skin, assisting in the test.
- **Skin Fold**: The skin is being gently pinched and lifted to form a tent-like shape.

This test is commonly used to assess the skin's elasticity and hydration status. In a well-hydrated individual, the skin should quickly return to its normal position when released. If the skin remains tented, it may indicate dehydration.

This single-use condom is a sheath of processed lamb cecum, latex, polyisoprene or polyurethane that fits over an erect penis (see Figure 3). It provides a receptacle that prevents semen from reaching the vagina and cervix. The use of latex condoms as a component of “safer sex” is widely publicized and encouraged as a means of reducing the risk of transmission of STIs, including HIV.​[^[28]] See Table 3 for a comparison of external condoms.

Theoretically, condoms should be completely effective in preventing pregnancy, but in reality they are not. Condom failure may be attributed to either breakage or slippage. The incidence of breakage has been reported to be between 0.5% and 2.5%, and that of slippage between 0.6% and 2%.​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]]

Risk factors associated with breakage and/or slippage include opening the package with sharp objects, unrolling condoms before putting them on, lack of sex education or experience in using condoms, and lengthy or intense intercourse.​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] The use of lubricants has been associated with increased slippage in vaginal intercourse and reduced slippage in anal intercourse.​[^[41]] Alcohol and recreational drug use are also associated with an increased incidence of condom failure (both breakage and slippage).​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] Some of these risks may be attenuated by providing appropriate counselling.

Condoms should not be used after the expiry date on the product packaging. They should be kept in a cool, dry place out of the sunlight.​[^[28]]

| Type of External (Male) Condom | STI Transmission Prevention | Compatibility with Lubricants | Additional Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latex | Offers the most protection. Effective against:HIV transmissionGonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B and trichomoniasis transmissionWhen the infected area or site of potential exposure is covered, it may provide protection against:HPV infection and HPV-associated diseases Genital herpes, syphilis and chancroid Mpox | Should not be used with oil-based lubricants (e.g., massage oil, Vaseline).Can be used with water-based lubricants (e.g., Astroglide, K-Y Jelly). | Made from natural rubber.Available in a variety of features, e.g., reservoir end, lubricated (wet or dry), lubricated with spermicide (nonoxynol-9), thin latex, extra strength, tapered, contoured, ribbed, studded, textured internal surface, coloured and flavoured.More elastic than lambskin condoms and more likely to remain in place on the penis during intercourse and on withdrawal.An estimated 1–6% of the population is allergic to latex. The most common symptom is genital inflammation with redness, itching and burning. In more severe cases, intraepidermal edema leads to the formation of vesicles. Once the vesicles rupture, the skin weeps, oozes and crusts. |
| Polyurethane | Similar to latex condoms.​[28] | Can be used with oil- or water-based lubricants or vaginal medications. | Latex-free; can be used by individuals who are allergic to latex.​[28]​[32]​[46]Stronger than latex so the condoms are thinner, allowing for greater sensation.Not as stretchy as latex, so breakage and slippage rates are higher.​[47] |
| Polyisoprene | Similar to latex condoms.​[47] | Should not be used with oil-based lubricants (e.g., massage oil, Vaseline).Can be used with water-based lubricants (e.g., Astroglide, K-Y Jelly). | Made from a synthetic rubber that is chemically the same as latex, except that the proteins causing latex allergy have been removed. Can be used by individuals who are allergic to latex.​[28]​[32]​[46]Compared with polyurethane, polyisoprene is softer, more form-fitting, thicker, more resistant to breakage and allows more stretch.​[47]​[48] |
| Lambskin | Does not provide protection against HIV or other STI transmission. | Can be used with oil- or water-based lubricants or vaginal medications. | Made from the intestinal cecum of lambs and may be referred to as “natural skin,” “natural membrane” or “lambskin” condoms.Elasticity is poor and they may slip off the penis during intercourse or on withdrawal.May provide better transmission of body heat and therefore greater sensitivity than latex condoms.Should be avoided by those who have allergies to lanolin or wool.​[28] |

#### Spermicides

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Contraceptive Products: Spermicidal Products and Devices.

Spermicides are products that are inserted vaginally and contain chemicals that kill or immobilize sperm.

Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) makes sperm unviable by making the sperm cell membranes permeable to moisture, resulting in swelling and destruction of the membranes.​[^[29]]​[^[49]]

Frequent use of N-9 can cause irritation and lesions to genital mucosa, which is thought to increase the risk of transmission of infections.​[^[49]]​[^[50]] The World Health Organization and the Contraceptive Development Program in the United States reviewed the evidence in 2001 and concluded that N-9 does not protect against the transmission of HIV, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, chlamydia, bacterial vaginosis or candidiasis.​[^[51]] The benefits and risks of the use of N-9 should be evaluated before using it for contraception.​[^[32]]



Spermicidal gel and film containing N-9 are currently available at most Canadian pharmacies. N-9 contraceptive gel is available in prefilled applicators. Advise patients to follow directions on the package insert. While the patient is lying down, the applicator is inserted into the vagina as deeply as possible, then the plunger is pushed to release the dose. Vaginal intercourse should take place within the prescribed time for the particular product being used (usually 30–60 min after insertion). More gel should be inserted if more than the prescribed time has passed since the first dose was inserted and for every time vaginal intercourse occurs.​[^[26]] After intercourse, any residual spermicide should not be removed (e.g., by douching) for at least 6 hours.​[^[23]]

VCF, a **vaginal contraceptive film**, contains N-9 in a film base.​[^[52]]​[^[53]] VCF dissolves completely and quickly into a gel after insertion high into the vagina against the cervix. It can be inserted from 15 minutes to 3 hours before vaginal intercourse. If more than 3 hours have elapsed or intercourse is repeated, another film should be inserted.​[^[54]] The gel acts as a barrier to block sperm from entering the cervix and the N-9 is spermicidal. To insert the film, the VCF is removed from the packaging, folded in half, placed on the tip of the second or third finger and then inserted into the vagina and applied against the cervix. Patients do not need to douche after intercourse, as the gel will disappear on its own. However, if douching is desired, the patient should wait at least 6 hours afterwards to avoid washing away spermicide too early.​[^[23]] Contraceptive films may be used alone or in combination with a barrier method.​[^[26]]

Contraceptive single-use sponges, pieces of soft foam filled with spermicide, have been on and off the market in Canada for a number of years (see Figure 4). Sponges are inserted into the vagina so that they cover the cervix. They function by 2 mechanisms: as a physical barrier by blocking the entrance to the uterus and by spermicidal activity.

The Today Sponge is the only sponge available in Canada. It can be inserted at any time before vaginal intercourse and must be kept in place for at least 6 hours afterwards. It provides contraceptive protection for 24 hours no matter how many times vaginal intercourse occurs. If it occurs when the sponge has been in place for 24 hours, the sponge should not be removed for another 6 hours. Thus, the maximum length of insertion for the sponge is 30 hours. Leaving the sponge in longer than 30 hours increases the risk of vaginal irritation and infections. The Today Sponge has a woven polyester loop on 1 side that aids in removal. Once removed, the sponge should be discarded.​[^[55]]

Since the end of 2019, Mayer Labs has been unable to produce the Today sponge due to major mechanical failure of their equipment. They are unable to advise when or if they will be able to manufacturer the Today Sponge in the future. This product remains licensed as a medical device with Health Canada.
