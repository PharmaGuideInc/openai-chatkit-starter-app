#### Introduction

Thyroid disease is extremely common, with women more frequently affected than men. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as women or men. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients. Each patient should be considered individually.*) The symptoms associated with thyroid disease are often nonspecific. A high index of suspicion coupled with a low threshold for screening for thyroid disease will capture most affected patients.

This chapter addresses hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis and thyroid nodules.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Hypothyroidism

#### Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a clinical syndrome that usually results from a deficiency of iodine or, in areas with sufficient iodine supply, autoimmune thyroid disease (see Table 1). Rarely, it can be due to resistance to thyroid hormone. An elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is a very sensitive indicator of hypothyroidism but may be low or normal in pituitary or hypothalamic disease. *Subclinical hypothyroidism* is defined by an elevated TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels.​[^[1]] If subclinical hypothyroidism is confirmed, consider treatment, especially in patients with TSH >10 mU/L (normally 0.3–4 mU/L, depending on the laboratory), an abnormal lipid profile, symptoms of hypothyroidism or who are planning a pregnancy.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]

#### Investigations



Note: Biotin supplements may interfere with thyroid tests; discontinue supplements at least 48 hours prior to testing.

| Cause | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Hashimoto thyroiditis | Most common cause in North America; anti-TPO levels could be elevated (measure only if result will change management). |
| Iatrogenic | Causes include surgical removal of thyroid; ​131I therapy; and drugs such as amiodarone, iodinated contrast agents, lithium, sulfonylureas and immunotherapy. |
| Hypothyroid phase of subacute thyroiditis | Usually transient, can persist in ~10%. |
| Congenital | Aplasia of thyroid; dyshormonogenesis. |
| Iodine deficiency | Rare in North America. |
| Recovering phase of nonthyroidal illness | Transiently elevated TSH. |
| Pituitary disorder | Secondary hypothyroidism; TSH low or normal; fT4 usually low. |
| Hypothalamic disorder | Tertiary hypothyroidism; TSH low or normal; fT4 usually low. |
| Resistance to thyroid hormone | High TSH, fT3 and fT4. |

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Levothyroxine

Replacement therapy with levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is the treatment of choice​[^[6]] (see Table 4). The goal is to normalize the TSH level. Replacement dosages average 1.6 mcg/kg/day in adults and 10–15 mcg/kg/day in newborns. Dosage adjustment is made every 6 weeks as needed (and every 4 weeks in pregnancy). Generally, it takes 6 weeks or more to attain a new steady state after dosage adjustments. In older patients or in patients with coronary artery disease, start with a dose as low as 12.5 mcg/day as tolerated and titrate every 4 weeks. High doses and low TSH may be associated with an increased risk of fracture in older patients.​[^[7]] 

#### Liothyronine (Triiodothyronine)

 Triiodothyronine (T3) is a very short-acting preparation; measuring free T3 levels may not be predictive of TSH. Relying completely on T3 for replacement is not ideal because it cannot replace the stability provided by the long half-life of L-T4. Trials with slow-release formulations still find fluctuations resulting in more time with elevated T3 levels, which might increase risks for serious side effects such as atrial fibrillation. T3 is useful for short-term management of patients with thyroid cancer undergoing withdrawal of L-T4 when recombinant TSH is not an option to prepare for radioactive iodine therapy. 

#### Combining Thyroid Supplements

The vast majority of thyroid hormone released from the thyroid is L-T4. Only a very small percentage of T3 is released by the thyroid; most circulating T3 is converted from L-T4 in the periphery. The combination of L-T4 and T3 is occasionally used for replacement therapy, though recent studies have shown little or no benefit of combination therapy and there is concern of it causing adverse effects with T3.​[^[8]]​[^[9]] In some cases where symptoms are not relieved with levothyroxine with normal TSH, low doses of T3 can be added in a dose of 5–12.5 mcg daily. A small reduction in levothyroxine may be needed to maintain TSH in the normal range.​[^[10]] Follow-up testing should be done with TSH testing usually about 6–8 weeks after a dose change and annually once on stable dosing or if new symptoms/concerns arise.

#### Desiccated Thyroid

Desiccated thyroid extract was widely used as replacement therapy until synthetic, human identical levothyroxine became available, allowing replacement therapy to more closely replicate what happens in vivo. Desiccated thyroid comes from animal thyroid, may not provide reliable dosing and presents no clear therapeutic advantage. If using due to patient preference, TSH remains the best indicator of adequate replacement.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Hypothyroidism and Pregnancy

Hypothyroidism can be associated with infertility and miscarriage.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Patients who are on thyroid hormone replacement or who are at risk of hypothyroidism should have a preconception TSH measurement and ensure it is normalized. In the first trimester, TSH levels in those not on thyroid hormone replacement are usually low due to high beta hCG levels that bind to the TSH receptor. If a patient’s first-trimester TSH is not on the lower side or is not suppressed, this may signal a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism; follow with a repeat TSH and begin treatment with levothyroxine if TSH remains >4 mU/L.

Those with hypothyroidism and prior history of Graves hyperthyroidism treated with thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine will need monitoring of their thyrotropin receptor antibodies prior to conception and if elevated will need to be seen by maternal fetal specialist for monitoring and possible treatment.

#### Management

Reassure patients that levothyroxine is safe during pregnancy and that thyroid hormone replacement is important to ensure a healthy pregnancy and normal fetal development. Liothyronine (T3) should not be used as sole replacement during pregnancy as it does not cross the placenta. Levothyroxine remains the best available medication for replacement during preconception and throughout pregnancy.  

Patients with known hypothyroidism who are taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be advised to increase their levothyroxine dose by 2 extra tablets per week immediately following a positive pregnancy test. Further dose adjustment should be based on TSH levels.​[^[6]]​[^[13]] Thyroid-binding globulins increase during pregnancy, so requirements for L-T4 replacement may increase by up to 50% during pregnancy to maintain TSH between 2.5 mU/L and the lower limit of the normal range.​[^[14]] Throughout pregnancy, patients on thyroid hormone replacement should have a TSH level every 6 weeks or 4 weeks after a dosage adjustment.

For patients who are not taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy, in the absence of local reference range for TSH in pregnancy, the TSH should be maintained <4 mU/L. Replacement can be initiated if TSH is >10 mU/L or if the patient has a confirmed TSH >4 mU/L.​[^[5]]

Postpartum, thyroid hormone requirements return to prepregnancy values. Iron supplements, which can lead to decreased absorption of levothyroxine, are frequently used in pregnant patients. Separate administration times by at least 6 hours (see Table 4). 

Referral to, or consultation with, an endocrinologist is indicated if, despite dosage adjustment, the patient continues to have TSH out of target range.

#### Hypothyroidism and Breastfeeding

Levothyroxine is safe during breastfeeding. In fact, untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism in the breastfeeding patient will augment symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance and constipation, though it is not likely to have effects on the baby. 

#### Management

Manage hypothyroidism just as in the nonbreastfeeding patient; avoid over-replacement with thyroid hormone. 

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Thyrotoxicosis

#### Introduction

Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the syndrome of excessive thyroid hormone and its effects (see Table 2). Hyperthyroidism is more specifically due to excess production of thyroid hormone. *Subclinical hyperthyroidism* is common and can be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] In subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH is suppressed while thyroid hormone levels are normal. Treatment is indicated if the patient is older and/or frail, has other risk factors for atrial fibrillation, has osteoporosis or has symptoms of thyroid hormone excess.​[^[17]]

*Thyroid storm* is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by severe thyrotoxicosis as well as other signs and symptoms. It has many causes including radioactive iodine, infection, trauma, surgery or withdrawal from antithyroid drugs.

| Cause | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Graves disease | Due to thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins activating the TSH receptor; most common cause of hyperthyroidism; patients frequently have eye disease and possibly pretibial myxedema;​[18] RAIU is elevated and thyroid scan with pertechnetate or ​123I shows a diffuse pattern. Thyroid receptor antibodies are usually elevated. |
| Subacute thyroiditis | Scan poorly defines the gland; RAIU is very low. |
| Postpartum thyroiditis | Scan poorly defines the gland; RAIU is very low (not recommended if patient is lactating). |
| Toxic nodule | Thyroid scan shows hot area. |
| Toxic multinodular goitre | Thyroid scan shows multiple hot areas; RAIU is slightly elevated. |
| Iodine excess | Usually in setting of multinodular goitre; RAIU is low. |
| Iatrogenic | Due to overtreatment with thyroid hormones; scan shows no thyroid; 0% RAIU. |
| Struma ovarii | Very rare; thyroid hormone production in ectopic sites; RAIU is 0%; body scan will show thyroid tissue in ovary. |
| Metastatic thyroid cancer | With large tumor burden. |
| TSH-producing pituitary adenoma | TSH elevated. |
| Stimulation of TSH receptor by excessive human chorionic gonadotropin | Examples are hydatidiform mole, hyperemesis gravidarum, other tumors; TSH is low or undetectable. |

#### Investigations



Note: Suppression of TSH can be seen in nonthyroidal illness, depression or treatment with corticosteroids, and some centrally acting medications (e.g., dopamine, octreotide). Biotin supplements may interfere with thyroid tests; discontinue supplements at least 48 hours prior to testing. In clear cases, and with availability of TRAb biochemistry, a thyroid scan and uptake is not routinely required.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Consider thyroid surgery in patients with thyroid nodules or large goitre (see Thyroid Nodules and Goitre). Surgery can be considered in patients with Graves disease if a surgeon is available who does complete thyroidectomies routinely. The surgical management of Graves disease is now more commonly considered in patients likely to become pregnant. Surgery is part of the management of thyroid cancer and ectopic production of thyroid hormone. Medical therapy with antithyroid drugs is frequently initiated prior to surgery to make the patient euthyroid, if possible. Hypothyroidism is a common and likely side effect. Follow closely postoperatively to determine when thyroid replacement is required; avoid hypothyroidism in patients with Graves orbitopathy.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Radioactive  iodine **(​[^131]I)** can be used to ablate thyroid tissue in patients with Graves disease, toxic autonomous nodules and toxic multinodular goitres. Inducing hypothyroidism is the main risk associated with its use. In pregnancy, ​[^131]I is contraindicated. In patients with significant orbitopathy, use with caution or use corticosteroids concomitantly with guidance of an ophthalmologist.​[^[19]]

Methimazole and propylthiouracil decrease the production of thyroid hormones; at high doses, propylthiouracil can also block the conversion of L-T4 to T3. Both drugs must be stopped about 5 days prior to a thyroid scan (scintigraphy), ​[^131]I uptake or treatment with ​[^131]I. Propylthiouracil may make the thyroid more resistant to ​[^131]I.​[^[20]] Side effects of these agents include allergy, rash, agranulocytosis and, rarely, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Methimazole is the preferred drug due to a lower incidence of serious (sometimes fatal) hepatotoxicity. Propylthiouracil should be avoided in children.​[^[21]] Long-term treatment with methimazole is more commonly considered as an acceptable treatment option. For dosing information, see Table 5.

Beta-blockers ameliorate the symptoms of adrenergic excess and are usually used adjunctively in the management of Graves disease or toxic nodules. Propranolol and nadolol can decrease the conversion of L-T4 to T3. Use beta-blockers with caution in patients with asthma, heart failure, obstructive respiratory disorders or Raynaud phenomenon.

Iodine, in the form of oral **Lugol solution** (6.3 mg iodide per drop), blocks thyroid hormone production. Iodine can be used in the acute management of severe hyperthyroidism. It should be given 1 hour after administration of an antithyroid drug.

Consider corticosteroids as therapy in treatment-resistant cases to lower the level of fT3.

Selenium 100 mcg twice daily may help prevent worsening of mild Graves orbitopathy and could be considered as supplemental therapy.​[^[22]] Patients should discuss this option with their eye-care specialist.

The management of *thyroid storm* involves supportive therapy in conjunction with aggressive treatment with antithyroid medications, beta-blockers and corticosteroids. Patients with thyroid storm are best managed in a critical care setting and should have cardiac monitoring. Use acetaminophen for hyperthermia. Avoid ASA and other NSAIDs, since these drugs can displace protein-bound thyroid hormones and increase the level of circulating free hormones.​[^[23]] Plasmapheresis can be considered in unresponsive cases.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Hyperthyroidism and Pregnancy

During pregnancy, hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease is the most likely scenario to be encountered. Hyperthyroidism due to subacute thyroiditis or other causes is possible, though less common.​[^[24]] In general, hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is well tolerated but should be treated to target the level of fT3 and fT4 near the upper limits of normal. Patients with hyperthyroidism should achieve good control prior to conception and, if treated with radioactive iodine or surgery, should consult with a physician prior to planning a pregnancy to ensure thyroid levels are normal.​[^[12]] In general, a patient should wait at least 6 months after receiving radioactive iodine before conceiving, due to radiation precautions. Hypothyroidism is a frequent outcome of radioactive iodine therapy and is expected with surgery; thyroid replacement may be necessary.​[^[11]]

Untreated hyperthyroidism could increase the risk of fetal loss. Patients with Graves disease and their doctors should be aware that those treated with surgery or radioactive iodine may still have a significant titre of stimulating TRAb that could result in hyperthyroidism in the fetus or newborn, so measurement is required. Treatment with antithyroid drugs could also affect the fetus and baby, so the lowest doses necessary to achieve the treatment goals should be used during pregnancy and lactation.

In most patients with Graves disease, hyperthyroidism may ameliorate during the second and third trimester, and treatment may not be required. Unfortunately, like other autoimmune disorders, it may flare again in the postpartum period.

#### Management

Prior to conception, ensure that thyroid levels are well controlled. Propylthiouracil remains preferable to methimazole during the first trimester of pregnancy due to a higher risk of congenital abnormalities with methimazole. Switch patients using methimazole to propylthiouracil. Methimazole is an acceptable second choice if propylthiouracil is contraindicated and drug therapy is necessary. Propylthiouracil confers a risk of serious hepatotoxicity; consider switching back to methimazole after the first trimester if feasible without disrupting control.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] In some cases, cessation of drug therapy can be considered. If only low doses of antithyroid medication are required, a trial without treatment should be considered. Beta-blockers can be used for mild symptoms to avoid exposing the fetus to antithyroid drugs. When planning permits, patients may wish to consider radioactive iodine ablation or thyroidectomy for treatment of hyperthyroidism over 6 months prior to actively trying to conceive.

During pregnancy, patients typically require lower doses of antithyroid medication and often go into remission. Monitoring is best done by measuring TSH, fT3 and fT4 every 6–8 weeks, and more often if a change in clinical status or dose is made. Aim for free hormone levels at or near the upper limit of normal to avoid overtreatment. The TSH is not the best guide, and it is anticipated the TSH level will remain low. 

At time of conception and approximately 18–22 weeks’ gestation, the TRAb titre should be measured and, if positive, repeated at 30–34 weeks; a high titre may mean higher risk of hyperthyroidism for the fetus or newborn, and specific monitoring by a neonatologist should be considered in those cases. Alternatively, if the titre is low in the first trimester, risks to the fetus are very low.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

Pre-treatment CBC and hepatic function tests that include ALT and bilirubin are recommended. Repeat testing for neutropenia or hepatic dysfunction should be performed only if there are clinical concerns, e.g., fever or pharyngitis. Neutropenia, if it occurs, is most common in the first 90 days of treatment. Hepatic effects of the antithyroid drugs occur within the first 120 days. Remind patients to stop the drug and contact their physician if they have fever, rash or jaundice. Blood work should be drawn to ensure the neutrophil count and ALT are normal before restarting the medication when possible. 

Avoid overtreatment of hyperthyroidism to avoid inducing hypothyroidism in the fetus or newborn. Ensure the physicians of the patient and baby are aware of the diagnosis of Graves disease and any treatments given, even if the patient’s disease is in remission.

Graves disease may reactivate in the postpartum period. Patients should be reminded of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g., rapid, unexpected weight loss; heat intolerance; palpitations; tremor) and urged to have their thyroid levels checked if they suspect a problem. 

Referral to an endocrinologist is reasonable for any patient who requires antithyroid medication during pregnancy; if not feasible, the physician may choose to discuss the case with a specialist. Patients with high titres of TRAb require intensive fetal assessment and should have their case reviewed by an endocrinologist or maternal fetal medicine expert.

#### Hyperthyroidism and Breastfeeding

Hyperthyroidism during breastfeeding should be treated or it could have detrimental effects on the patient (atrial fibrillation, bone loss and psychological effects in the short term; myopathy and cardiomyopathy in the long term). The goal is to ensure the fT3 and fT4 levels are near the upper limit of normal and not to overtreat. Hyperthyroidism may obviously be Graves disease in someone with a prior history or could be the result of postpartum thyroiditis. Other causes are possible but less likely. In all cases, if the cause is not clear, refer to an endocrinologist. Avoid the use of radioactive scans or radioactive iodine treatment during breastfeeding.

#### Management

Methimazole is now the preferred antithyroid drug during breastfeeding due to concerns of serious hepatotoxicity associated with propylthiouracil. Propylthiouracil can, however, be used if methimazole is contraindicated or not tolerated, or if warranted to facilitate care of the patient. 

The baby’s physician should be aware the patient is using antithyroid medication and may decide to check the baby’s TSH level, especially if the patient is on a high dose (to ensure the baby is not made hypothyroid). Beta-blockers can be used for short-term management of symptomatic hyperthyroidism until control is achieved with antithyroid drugs. Radioactive iodine therapy should be postponed until breastfeeding is stopped. Thyroid hormone levels should be checked every 4–6 weeks until control is stable and then every 3 months.

Routine screening for side effects of antithyroid drugs is not recommended, but they should be suspected within the first 4 months of starting these drugs or if concerning symptoms arise. Pre-treatment CBC, ALT and bilirubin should be tested when possible. Remind patients to stop the drug and contact their physician if they have fever, rash or jaundice. Blood work should be drawn to ensure the neutrophil count and ALT are normal before restarting the medication. Hepatic enzymes are frequently elevated in hyperthyroidism unrelated to treatment.

Patients can be reassured that hyperthyroidism can be successfully managed in pregnant and breastfeeding patients to ensure good health for both the patient and the baby. Management is a team approach and patients must ensure their physicians are aware of their thyroid condition and medications.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Thyroid Nodules and Goitre

#### Introduction

Individuals with goitre may be at higher risk for disorders of thyroid function and should be screened with a TSH level at presentation and if symptoms arise. Goitres in euthyroid patients can be problematic if growing or causing compressive symptoms. The usual treatment is surgery. Levothyroxine can be considered in some cases with higher TSH, including pediatric cases, as it may help prevent further growth.

Thyroid nodules are very common. They may be identified incidentally by ultrasound, CT, MRI or PET scanning.​[^[25]] Nodules within a multinodular goitre should be investigated similarly to a solitary nodule. Clinical history and high-quality ultrasound assessment for presence or absence of concerning features in each nodule with comparison to previous scans is useful to determine when to proceed to fine needle aspiration biopsy​[^[26]] (see Figure 1).

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Surgery for compressive symptoms of thyroid enlargement is the definitive therapy. Surgical pathology will confirm or exclude malignancy and reduce compressive symptoms. The risks associated with surgery include hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord paralysis.

Ultrasound features usually can help stratify the risk of malignancy. A high-quality ultrasound report should describe the risk of malignancy associated with each nodule. The thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) used in Canada is a points-based system to determine risk and whether a nodule qualifies for fine needles biopsy.​[^[27]] The clinical scenario, stability and previous FNAB results should also be considered. Clinical risk factors that may increase the risk for malignancy are listed in Table 3.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <20 or >60 years of age | Nodule fixed to soft tissue |
| Family history of thyroid cancer | Previous malignancy |
| Lymphadenopathy | Prior radiation exposure |
| Male | Vocal cord paralysis |
| Nodule >4 cm in size or rapidly growing |  |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy can be used to treat a toxic multinodular goitre or a *hot* nodule, although it is associated with a risk of developing hypothyroidism (see Table 4). Radiofrequency ablation or injection of thyroid nodules as a method of treatment is not widely available in Canada.
