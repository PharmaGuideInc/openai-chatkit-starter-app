#### Introduction

Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness associated with an inability to maintain postural tone, rapid and spontaneous recovery, and the absence of clinical features specific for another form of transient loss of consciousness such as epileptic seizure.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]] Probably over 50% of people have a syncopal episode, or faint, at least once in their lifetime, and many faint recurrently.â€‹[^[4]]â€‹[^[5]] Most people who faint have a benign cause but very few are at risk of death. Common causes of syncope are listed in Table 1. The goal of patient assessment is to determine an etiologic diagnosis and related risk of adverse outcomes.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



See Figure 1 for a summary of the diagnostic approach to syncope. See Vasovagal Syncope and Orthostatic Hypotension for management of these conditions.

#### Vasovagal Syncope

#### Introduction

Vasovagal syncope is a syncope syndrome that usually occurs with an upright posture held for more than 30 seconds or with exposure to emotional stress, pain or medical settings. Features include diaphoresis, warmth, nausea and pallor. It is associated with hypotension and relative bradycardia and is followed by fatigue.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Drug therapy may be effective in some, although the evidence is mixed. Drugs that may be considered are shown in Table 2. See the patient at least yearly to attempt to stop the drugs. Drug therapy may be unnecessary in patients with infrequent vasovagal syncope who have recognizable premonitory symptoms.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]]

Fludrocortisone can be tried if simple salt supplements are ineffective. The goal is fluid retention, which may precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients. A single randomized trial in children was negative.â€‹[^[16]] In adults, a trial of fludrocortisone reduced the likelihood of syncope by 50% in a subgroup of patients who had taken the drug for at least 2 weeks.â€‹â€‹[^[17]]

Alpha-agonists increase venous return, and thereby may prevent the onset of vasovagal syncope. Midodrine should be considered. It reduced the proportion of patients with syncope by a statistically significant 31% with a number needed to treat of 5.3 in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.â€‹[^[18]] This improvement was numerically nearly identical to, and is supported by, a similar but underpowered earlier study.â€‹[^[19]] Supine hypertension and urinary retention in older patients may complicate treatment.

**SSRIs** are not usually used for preventing vasovagal syncope. Paroxetine significantly reduced the frequency of spontaneous syncope over 2 years compared with placebo in a randomized trial,â€‹[^[20]] although fluoxetine was not demonstrated to be helpful in another trial.â€‹[^[21]] 

**Beta-blockers** are not indicated as treatment for vasovagal syncope.â€‹[^[1]] 

#### Orthostatic Hypotension

#### Introduction

Orthostatic hypotension is a drop in systolic BP of â‰¥20 mmâ€‰Hg or diastolic BP of â‰¥10 mmâ€‰Hg when assuming an upright posture.â€‹[^[1]]â€‹[^[2]]â€‹[^[3]] The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion while avoiding treatment side effects. Orthostatic hypotension is often associated with supine hypertension, which complicates its therapy. 

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Promoting sodium and water retention using specific drugs may be beneficial in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Fludrocortisone increases blood volume and sensitizes peripheral alpha receptors, so it is recommended despite the lack of randomized trials (see Table 2). 

Midodrine (see Table 2) is a pressor amine that causes both venoconstriction (thereby increasing venous return) and arteriolar constriction (which directly increases blood pressure). Evidence supporting its use is limited, but midodrine can be used to significantly increase standing blood pressure and decrease symptoms.â€‹[^[22]] Timing of doses can be adjusted to match patient symptoms. Supine hypertension and other unwanted effects such as shivering may complicate treatment.

The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine, given alone or in combination with midodrine, significantly improved standing blood pressure without increasing supine blood pressure in a short-term randomized placebo-controlled trial.â€‹[^[23]] Further study is needed before this agent can be recommended.

Nonselective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol, nadolol) block vasodilatory beta2-receptors and reduce or abolish the fall in blood pressure upon standing in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Results of a small trial suggests they may be helpful if indicated for another reason and if tolerated.â€‹[^[24]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to guide the evaluation and management of certain cardiac and neurological conditions. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Question:**
   - "Is ECG abnormal (VT, signs of old infarction, conduction system disease, genetic arrhythmias) or structural heart disease present?"
     - **Yes:** Refer urgently to cardiologist.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

2. **Second Question:**
   - "Is a documented, symptomatic bradycardia (asystole or complete heart block) present?"
     - **Yes:** Pacemaker.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

3. **Third Question:**
   - "Presentation compatible with obstruction such as aortic stenosis, PE?"
     - **Yes:** 
       - Refer patients with PE to ER immediately.
       - Refer patients with aortic stenosis to cardiologist within 1â€“2 months.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

4. **Fourth Question:**
   - "Seizures other than syncope-related myoclonus suspected?"
     - **Yes:** Refer to a neurologist.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

5. **Fifth Question:**
   - "Any reversible causes: volume depletion, diuretics, vasodilators, alpha- or beta-blockers, nitrates?"
     - **Yes:** Correct if possible.
     - **No:** Proceed to the next question.

6. **Sixth Question:**
   - "Orthostatic intolerance syndromes?"
     - **Yes:** Stand test: Consider neurology consult for primary autonomic failure only.

The flowchart systematically evaluates potential cardiac and neurological issues, providing specific referral and management recommendations based on the presence or absence of certain conditions.
