#### Pathophysiology

The skin and its appendages (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) serve several important functions. They protect against minor injury, help control body temperature and water loss, prevent invasion by microorganisms, and prevent radiation damage from sun exposure.

The skin is composed of 3 main layers: epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue​[^[1]] (see Figure 1). The epidermis consists of 4 or 5 layers of cells, depending on where it is located on the body. Cells migrate upward through the layers, undergoing keratinization and transitioning into flat, nonliving corneocytes that form the thick, brick-like structure of the uppermost part of the epidermis: the stratum corneum. Layers of corneocytes are shed from the stratum corneum at the skin’s surface as new keratinocytes push up from below in a continuous cycle of renewal. Corneocytes contain natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that attracts and binds water from the atmosphere and are surrounded by a lipid matrix consisting of ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids that prevent water loss and protect against absorption of foreign substances.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

Together, the components of the stratum corneum form the skin barrier that protects the lower layers of the epidermis from damage and regulates hydration of the skin. Any environmental or physiologic factor that compromises the stratum corneum skin barrier, leading to an increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) or a decrease in NMF or ceramides and other lipids, can lead to dry skin (see Table 1). Accordingly, research in the treatment of dry skin conditions focusses on the effects of therapy on TEWL, NMF and the ceramide content of the skin.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

“Dry skin” (also known as xeroderma or xerosis) is commonly used to describe skin that may be rough to the touch and have mild scaling, flaking or peeling of the upper layers and is often very itchy, with possible cracking if severe enough.​[^[5]]​[^[7]] Dry skin most often affects the skin of the thighs, lower legs, sides of the abdomen and the arms but can occur anywhere on the body. The incidence of dry skin increases with age but can occur at any age depending on skin type, environmental factors, medical conditions and chronic skin conditions.​[^[7]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a labeled diagram of a cross-section of human skin, illustrating its various layers and structures. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Layers of the Skin:**
   - **Epidermis:** The outermost layer of the skin.
   - **Dermis:** The middle layer beneath the epidermis.
   - **Subcutaneous Tissue:** The innermost layer, also known as the hypodermis.

2. **Structures within the Skin:**
   - **Hair:** Extends from the surface into the dermis.
   - **Hair Follicle:** The structure from which the hair grows, located in the dermis.
   - **Sebaceous Gland:** Attached to the hair follicle, responsible for secreting sebum (oil).
   - **Arrector Pili Muscle:** A small muscle connected to the hair follicle, responsible for causing hair to stand (goosebumps).
   - **Sweat Duct:** A channel that carries sweat from the sweat gland to the surface of the skin.
   - **Sweat Gland:** Located in the dermis, responsible for producing sweat.

The diagram provides a clear representation of the anatomical features of the skin, showing the relationship between the different layers and structures.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Assessment includes differentiating between dry skin and other skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infections). Patients require further assessment and/or treatment if the condition does not respond to initial treatment for dry skin. Treatment failure may indicate an underlying medical disease or condition. An approach to the patient with concerns about dry skin is presented in Figure 2. 

|  |
| --- |
| Genetic abnormalities in keratinocyte composition or function (e.g., ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis) |
| Bathing or showering in hot water too frequently or for long periods of time |
| Swimming in chlorinated pools |
| Changes in skin pH due to use of harsh (alkaline pH), perfumed deodorant or antibacterial soaps |
| Overexposure to sun (e.g., photoaging) |
| Normal skin aging (decreased activity in the sebaceous and sweat glands) |
| Low humidity (e.g., cold/windy or very hot climates, electric heat, fireplaces, air conditioning, recycled air in airplanes) |
| Medical conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, diabetes, liver disease) |
| Exposure to UV radiation (e.g., sun) or chemicals |
| Abrasion |
| Certain skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis) |
| Medications that may cause dry skin (e.g., anticholinergics, antihistamines, diuretics, EGFR inhibitors, niacin, statins, systemic retinoids, VEGFR inhibitors, vitamin A toxicity) |

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy of dry skin includes improving skin hydration and mitigating any contributing factors, if possible (see Table 1).

Several self-care measures will improve the feeling of dry, rough skin.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[13]]​[^[15]] Offer the following advice:



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Dermatitis and Dry Skin, First Aid.

Consistent and liberal use of therapeutic moisturizers is the mainstay of treatment for dry skin. See Table 2.​[^[18]]

|  |
| --- |
| There is no reliable evidence that one moisturizer is better than another. Apply moisturizers while the skin is still damp (within 3 minutes after bathing) as well as several times a day (3–4 times daily). |
| Applying adequate amounts of moisturizer is more important than which moisturizer is chosen. |
| Choose a moisturizer with an agreeable feel and smell (to encourage use). |
| Avoid products with added fragrance or irritants, e.g., salicylic acid. |
| Choose a noncomedogenic moisturizer for use on the face in the case of acne-prone skin. |
| Avoid any product that stings, burns or irritates on contact. |
| Ensure the product is affordable (to encourage adequate use). |
| More costly products may not be superior with respect to risk of containing contact allergens.​[19] |
| Plain petrolatum jelly, while greasy, is highly effective, nonirritating and inexpensive. |
| Be aware that many moisturizers may also contain sunscreens to prevent sun-induced skin damage. |
| Note that all moisturizers can dry onto clothing, bedding, bandages or furniture, making them more flammable. Use caution when near open flames and wash clothing and bedding regularly to reduce moisturizer build-up.​[20] |


Evidence in patients with atopic dermatitis has shown that the addition of bath oils to bath water does not provide any clinical benefit over standard management with moisturizers​[^[21]] but poses a possible risk of injury from slipping. If bath oils are used in the treatment of dry skin, it is safer to apply them directly to the damp skin after the bath.

Moisturizer products come in various formats (e.g., cream, lotion, ointment, gels), each with their own advantages and disadvantages:​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[15]]

| Moisturizer Format | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cream | Easily absorbed with minimal residue, cosmetically appealing | Shorter duration of effect, may sting upon application to irritated skin |
| Lotion | Easily absorbed with minimal residue, cosmetically appealing, thin, easy to spread over large or hairy areas | Shorter duration of effect, may sting upon application to irritated skin |
| Ointment | Longer duration of effect, forms protective barrier, less likely to sting upon application to irritated skin | Greasy, thick, sticky, cosmetically less acceptable |
| Water-based gels | Lightweight, easily absorbed, may be more suitable for use on the face due to low oil content | Less effective, shortest duration of effect, may contain alcohol (drying), mostly available as facial products only |


The active ingredients in moisturizers are generally classified as occlusives, humectants or emollients based on their mechanism of action (see Table 3). Additional categories such as barrier repair therapies may be included in some sources. Some ingredients may have more than one mechanism of action. Most commercial moisturizer products consist of various combinations of ingredient classes in order to increase effectiveness and ease or appeal of application. In addition to active moisturizing ingredients, products often contain emulsifiers and preservatives and may contain any number of miscellaneous ingredients claiming to have additional beneficial effects on the skin.

| Type | Action | Examples​[a] | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Occlusives | Physically block surface of stratum corneum to reduce transepidermal water loss (TEWL), which promotes barrier repair. Minimizing water loss to the external environment allows the stratum corneum to draw water from the deeper layers of the epidermis and from the dermis. | Hydrocarbons, e.g., petrolatum, mineral oil, paraffin, squaleneSilicone-based polymers, e.g., cyclomethicone, dimethiconePlant oils, e.g., coconut oil, castor oil, grape seed oil, hemp oil, jojoba oil, soybean oilAnimal fats, e.g., mink oil, lanolinWax esters, e.g., beeswax, lanolinSterols, e.g., cholesterol, ceramidesZinc oxide (also added as a sunscreen) | Petrolatum is very effective but not cosmetically appealing (greasy, difficult to spread and remove).Lanolin may cause contact dermatitis; avoid in patients with sensitive skin.Occlusives are generally not well tolerated on facial skin or in hot, humid climates due to their greasy nature.Silicone-based polymers are often found in “oil-free” products.Apply TID–QID PRN. |
| Humectants | Contain compounds that attract and bind water, causing water to be drawn from the deeper layers of the epidermis and from the dermis into the stratum corneum.Retain water already present. | Glycerin (most effective), alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), colloidal oatmeal, glycolic acid, honey, lactic acid, propylene glycol, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, urea | Unless used in combination with occlusives, some humectants may increase TEWL and exacerbate dryness.Glycerin in high concentrations may increase TEWL by drawing water away from the skin and may be irritating. Not to be used alone or in those with sensitive skin.Lactic acid (>12%) and urea (>10%) are keratolytic and used for treatment of more severe skin conditions. Lower concentrations are recommended as moisturizing agents (lactic acid ≤12% and urea ≤10%).Urea improves itching but may cause stinging and burning on open skin in any concentration.Apply BID–TID PRN. |
| Emollients | Have some occlusive properties (see above), but main function is to fill the spaces between cells in the stratum corneum, sealing moisture into the skin, which makes it feel smoother and softer. | Castor oil, ceramides, cocoa butter, coconut oil, colloidal oatmeal, fatty acids, lanolin, lipids, mineral oil, palm oil, vitamins A and E, wool fat | Combining with emulsifiers (stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol) may improve the oil/water balance of the product.May be combined with occlusives to decrease water loss.Apply TID–QID PRN. |
| Barrier repair agents | Normalize skin barrier by replacing ceramides, decreasing TEWL and decreasing triggers for inflammation. | Ceramides/cholesterol/free fatty acids combinations | Used to treat dry skin and associated pruritus in atopic, irritant and radiation dermatitis. |


#### Monitoring of Therapy

Mild to moderate dry skin can be self-managed by patients educated on nonpharmacologic methods of treatment and prevention. Advise patients to monitor the skin daily for 7–10 days after starting treatment for improvement in symptoms and to seek medical attention if the condition worsens or shows no improvement.

Table 4 provides a plan for monitoring therapy for dry skin.

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rough, scaly skin | Monitor daily for 7–10 days for signs of improvement with treatment (moisturizers or nonpharmacologic methods). | Skin feels smoother, has returned to its normal colour, is no longer rough or irritated. | If irritation worsens, consider allergy to moisturizer ingredient and discontinue. |
| Itching | Monitor daily for 7–10 days for decrease in symptoms with treatment (moisturizers or nonpharmacologic methods).Monitor for signs of infection if scratching has caused open areas. | Itching has decreased or is controlled (no scratching or signs of infection). | If itching does not improve, consider the addition of a second moisturizer from a different group for an additive effect.If itching increases, consider the possibility of sensitization to the product and try switching to a moisturizer from a different group.Signs of infection (pus, pain, colour change) require further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Dry, flaky skin | Monitor daily while using moisturizing products.Monitor for signs of improvement. | Dry, flaky skin has decreased or skin is soft and hydrated. | If skin continues to be dry and flaky, consider alternative treatment. |


#### Algorithms

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for assessing and managing skin conditions based on symptoms and other factors. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Assess patient's symptoms, medical conditions, current medication, allergies, family history, onset and duration of symptoms, and previous treatments.

2. **Decision Point:**
   - **Mild Symptoms:**
     - Mild itching
     - Inflammation affecting thighs, lower legs, sides of the abdomen, or arms
     - Assess for and, if possible, eliminate contributing factors.

   - **Severe Symptoms:**
     - Severe itching and inflammation
     - Involvement of flexural areas, neck, or feet (may indicate atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infection, bacterial infection)
     - Large area (>30% of the body surface area)
     - Age <2 years
     - Signs of infection

3. **Management for Mild Symptoms:**
   - Self-treat with moisturizers.
   - Avoid ingredients that may sensitize skin (e.g., aloe vera, fragrance, propylene glycol) in those with sensitive skin or in the elderly.

4. **Effectiveness Check:**
   - **Effective:** Continue with self-treatment.
   - **Ineffective:** Consider product with urea or lactic acid or a ceramide-dominant barrier repair therapy.

5. **Management for Severe Symptoms:**
   - Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment.

6. **Follow-up:**
   - If the condition worsens or shows <50% improvement after 7–10 days of treatment, further assessment is needed.

This flowchart guides the decision-making process for treating skin conditions based on severity and response to initial treatment.
