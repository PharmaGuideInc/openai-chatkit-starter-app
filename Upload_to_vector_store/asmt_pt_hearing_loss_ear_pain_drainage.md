#### Signs and Symptoms

Ear symptoms may occur in many conditions. Table 1 describes signs and symptoms associated with various otic conditions and Figure 1 provides an algorithm for patient assessment. Signs and symptoms commonly associated with ear disease include ear pain, ear drainage, tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness and hearing loss. Assessment should include determining the patient’s age and the location and characteristics of the pain as well as the presence or absence of pruritus, hearing loss, discharge from the ear, or any aggravating factors associated with the symptoms.

| Condition | Pain | Pruritus | Discharge | Hearing Loss | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acute bacterial otitis externa​[1] | Yes(acute onset) | Sometimes | Frequently | Sometimes | Associated with excessive moisture, trauma to EAC, attempts to scratch or remove wax from EAC. Pain with chewing, movement of auricle (pushing the tragus or pulling the pinna). May be described as fullness. |
| Barotrauma​[2] | Yes | No | Yes, if TM ruptures | Yes | Associated with air travel (descent) and diving. Tinnitus and vertigo may also be present. |
| Foreign body​[3] | Yes | Sometimes | If infected | Yes | Fullness and pressure in the ear. |
| Impacted earwax (cerumen)​[4] | Rarely, unless infected | Frequently | Rarely, unless infected | Yes(gradual) | May be described as fullness or pressure. |
| Otitis media​[5] | Yes(abrupt onset) | No | Yes, if TM ruptures | Sometimes | Primarily in children. Commonly preceded by viral URTI. Pain relieved with rupture of TM. |
| Ruptured tympanic membrane​[6] | Yes(sudden, sharp) | No | Yes | Yes(abrupt) | May be associated with acute otitis media, barotrauma or other conditions. |

#### Ear Pain (Otalgia)

Otalgia is usually associated with inflammation of the external or middle ear, but pain may be referred to the ear from other sites such as the teeth, temporomandibular joint, pharynx or sinuses.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]] If pain lasts more than 2–3 days, refer the patient for medical evaluation.

#### Ear Drainage (Otorrhea)

Otorrhea may be caused by a simple scratch in the ear or by serious medical conditions. It is often a sign of otitis externa, otitis media with perforation of the tympanic membrane or drainage from the middle ear from tympanostomy tubes.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] Bloody drainage can occur with several conditions, including trauma, neoplasm and foreign bodies. Clear drainage may be from the middle ear or a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Drainage resulting from mild otitis externa (e.g., eczematous) may be self-treated; however, unless this is specifically identified as the cause, the patient should be referred for assessment and treatment.

#### Hearing Loss

Hearing loss is classified as either conductive or sensorineural.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]] Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound is prevented from gaining access to the inner ear, and may result from diseases of the external or middle ear. Examples include otitis externa, impacted earwax, upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, foreign objects or water trapped in the ear, and tumors. Rupture of the tympanic membrane due to acute otitis media or trauma also produces hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss involves the inner ear or cochlea, the auditory nerve, or a central nerve lesion. These conditions are not managed by self-care. Unless hearing loss is identified as due to impacted earwax, otitis externa or an upper respiratory tract infection, all patients with hearing loss should be referred to an appropriate health-care practitioner for assessment.

#### Tinnitus, Vertigo and Dizziness

Symptoms related to these conditions are discussed in detail in Tinnitus and in Vertigo and Dizziness.

#### Drug-induced Ototoxicity

Hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo may be drug induced. It is important to review a patient’s medication profile to ensure that symptoms are not due to drug-induced ototoxicity. Many drugs have been associated with ototoxicity, sometimes only as a single case report.​[^[15]] Drugs more commonly associated with ototoxicity are found in Table 2. This is not an exhaustive list; a more comprehensive list can be found in Cianfrone et al. and Lanvers-Kaminsky et al. (see Suggested Readings).

| Drug | Type of Hearing Loss | Reversibility | Risk Factors | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aminoglycosides​[16]​[17]​[18]​[19](amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin) | Cochlear (sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) and vestibular (unrelenting dizziness with occasional nausea and vomiting). | Irreversible. | Possibly related to total dose administered.Not correlated well with serum concentrations.Renal insufficiency.Age >60 y.Previous sensorineural hearing loss, noise exposure, concurrent use of other ototoxic drugs.Duration of treatment >10 days. | Discontinuation at first sign may limit damage.Audiology monitoring recommended by some, as initial hearing loss may be higher frequency and not noticed by patient.Vestibular testing (e.g., dynamic illegible E [DIE]) recommended by some.Risk no greater with once-daily dosing compared with multiple daily doses. |
| ASA​[20]​[21] | Tinnitus.Decreased acoustic sensitivity and altered sound perception. | Hearing loss usually recovers 24–72 h after discontinuation. | Correlated with serum salicylate levels and higher doses.Elderly patients. |  |
| Cisplatin​[22]​[23] | Sensorineural hearing loss. Some patients exhibit tinnitus.Bilateral. | Usually permanent. | Renal insufficiency, pre-existing hearing loss and noise exposure.Increased risk with renal insufficiency, high serum drug levels, age >60 y, previous sensorineural hearing loss, noise exposure, concurrent use of other ototoxic drugs, duration of treatment >10 days. | Dose-related, cumulative. |
| Loop diuretics​[20]​[24]​[25](bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, furosemide) | Hearing loss and tinnitus. | Usually transient.Permanent hearing loss also reported. | Renal failure.Generally with high-dose intravenous use.Concurrent use of ototoxic drugs.Hypoalbuminemia.Liver disease.Heart failure.Furosemide infusion rates >4 mg/min. |  |
| Macrolides​[26]​[27]​[28]​[29]​[30](azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) | Sensorineural with tinnitus.Bilateral. | Usually reversible.Irreversible hearing loss and tinnitus reported at low doses as well. | Renal dysfunction.Hepatic dysfunction.Female sex.Erythromycin dose >4 g/day. | Recovery begins as soon as drug is discontinued. |
| Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors​[31](sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) | Sudden hearing loss sometimes accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.Usually unilateral. | Reversible in one-third of cases. | Unknown. |  |
| Quinine​[20]​[21] | High-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity also seen. | Reversible.Bilateral. | Initiation of high-dose therapy or chronic lower dose therapy. | Cinchonism: headache, nausea, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, blindness, dysphoria. |
| Tetracyclines (doxycycline,​[32] minocycline​[33]​[34]) | Vestibular symptoms such as lightheadedness, loss of balance, dizziness and tinnitus. | Generally self-limiting. | More common in women. | Occurs at usual oral doses and usually disappears within 2 days. |


#### Miscellaneous Conditions Affecting the Ear

Conditions affecting the auricle such as dermatitis (see Atopic, Contact and Stasis Dermatitis), infections (see Bacterial Skin Infections; Fungal Skin Infections), burns (see Burns), frostbite (see Frostbite) and lacerations (see Minor Cuts and Wounds) are amenable to self-treatment if not severe. More detailed assessment by an appropriate health-care provider is required if these are not easily distinguishable by history and appearance.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart designed to guide the assessment of ear complaints. It provides a structured approach to evaluating symptoms and determining the appropriate course of action. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Initial Assessment
- **Ear Complaint**: The flowchart begins with the identification of an ear complaint.
- **History Check**: It asks if the patient has a history of:
  - Ear surgery in the past 6 weeks
  - Ruptured tympanic membrane(s)
  - Tympanostomy tubes
  - If "Yes," refer for assessment by an appropriate healthcare practitioner.
  - If "No," proceed to identify the primary complaint.

### Primary Complaints
1. **Ear Pain**
   - **Associated with Ear Drainage?**
     - Yes: Refer for assessment.
     - No: Check for association with flying or scuba diving.
       - Yes: Consider barotrauma. If pain lasts >24 hours, refer for assessment.
       - No: Check for pruritus, tenderness, or debris in the external auditory canal (EAC).
         - Yes: Possible otitis externa.
         - No: Check for symptoms consistent with otitis media.
           - Yes: Refer for assessment.
           - No: Check for symptoms consistent with a foreign body.
             - If symptoms persist >2-3 days, refer as appropriate. Otherwise, no intervention required.

2. **Hearing Loss**
   - **Associated with Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)?**
     - Yes: 
       - Reassure
       - Suggest symptomatic treatment for URTI
       - If hearing loss does not improve, refer for assessment.
     - No: Check for acute onset with pain.
       - Yes: Possible tympanic membrane (TM) rupture; refer for assessment.
       - No: Check for the possibility of a foreign body in the ear canal.
         - Yes: Refer for assessment and/or removal.
         - No: Check for feeling of fullness, itching, and irritation.
           - Yes: Possible impacted earwax.
           - No: Refer for assessment.

3. **Tinnitus**
   - Refer for assessment by an appropriate healthcare practitioner.

### Notes
- **Footnotes**:
  - \(^{a}\) Primary complaints include ear pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus.
  - \(^{b}\) Barotrauma refers to ear pain associated with pressure changes.
  - \(^{c}\) Otitis externa is an infection of the outer ear canal.
  - \(^{d}\) URTI symptoms include nasal congestion.
