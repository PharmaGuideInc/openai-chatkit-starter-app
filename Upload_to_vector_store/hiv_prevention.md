CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Just over 62 000 Canadians were believed to be living with HIV infection at the end of 2018,​[^[1]] and a further 2122 new infections were diagnosed in 2019.​[^[1]] Health Canada’s surveillance data indicate that the prevalence of new HIV infections for 2021 was 11.3% higher than in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced demand for and ability to provide services related to sexually transmitted and bloodborne infections (STBBIs), including HIV testing, suggesting that this may not reflect the true rate of new infections.​[^[2]] Modern use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) has improved the prognosis of HIV infection, which is now regarded as a chronic, manageable condition. However, increased efforts are needed to prevent new infections from occurring.

HIV is transmissible through exposure to the virus via sexual or blood-borne routes, as well as during pregnancy and childbirth and via breastfeeding if the birthing parent has an uncontrolled HIV infection. ARVs have been demonstrated to prevent new HIV infections in 4 ways: 



This chapter focuses on pre- and postexposure prophylaxis. Guidelines exist that provide advice for the use of PrEP, PEP and nPEP, including how to determine who should receive ARVs and which ARV regimens are recommended in each setting.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Decisions about whether prophylaxis is indicated in each situation are based on the likelihood of transmission considering both the exposure type and the likelihood that the source person has transmissible HIV infection.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis

#### Introduction

ARVs can reduce the risk of HIV transmission when taken by individuals before they have exposure to the virus. This is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Canadian guidelines indicate that PrEP should be offered to individuals who are at high risk or have ongoing risk of contracting HIV.​[^[3]] In the United States, the 2021 CDC guidelines recommend that all clinicians talk to their sexually active patients about PrEP at least once.​[^[4]]

PrEP should not be used for someone who is known to be HIV positive and should not be started in someone with signs/symptoms of acute HIV infection or with a probable recent exposure to HIV until a new infection is ruled out. These individuals should be assessed for a new HIV infection and if diagnosed, should receive treatment for HIV infection (see HIV Infection: Treatment).

#### First-Line PrEP Therapy

In Canada, there are 2 medications approved for PrEP: emtricitabine/​tenofovir DF and emtricitabine/​tenofovir AF. Each of these is a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) coformulated into 1 tablet, which is normally taken daily for PrEP. 

 When taken on a daily basis with excellent adherence, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of HIV transmission among MSM and transgender women​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]] and in heterosexual men and women.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] However, efficacy greatly depends on level of adherence and the population studied (e.g., lower efficacy in women, people who use drugs); in clinical trials, overall efficacy varied from 44–86% among MSM and transgender women to up to 100% among MSM with high adherence.​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Modelling studies suggest that based on the previous U.S. CDC criteria​[^[5]] for PrEP use (which is similar to Canadian criteria), approximately 25 MSM would need to take PrEP to prevent 1 new HIV infection.​[^[20]] Women may be more at risk of PrEP failure with missed doses due to pharmacokinetic differences in drug absorption and distribution to vaginal tissue.​[^[21]] In all patients, adherence must be assessed and supported at each follow-up visit to optimize effectiveness.

Daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir AF has also been approved for PrEP, except for those at risk due to receptive vaginal intercourse (due to lack of data). The DISCOVER trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of emtricitabine/tenofovir AF in comparison to emtricitabine/tenofovir DF for daily oral PrEP in MSM and transgender women.​​[^[22]] Tenofovir AF is associated with less renal and bone toxicity compared with tenofovir DF when used for HIV treatment, though evidence suggests this is not as significant a concern for either drug when used for PrEP. Furthermore, it has an improved pharmacokinetic profile, making it an attractive option for PrEP from both a safety and efficacy standpoint. However, weight gain has been a reported adverse effect for PrEP, and it is more costly than generic emtricitabine/tenofovir DF.

Patients who initiate PrEP should be assessed for efficacy and safety at 1 month, 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter. Tolerability is very good, though some people experience a “start-up syndrome” consisting of headache, nausea and/or flatulence, which typically resolves within 1 month of starting therapy. While reduced bone mineral density has been reported with tenofovir DF, routine DEXA monitoring is not indicated in PrEP unless there is a history of pathologic or fragility fractures or significant risk factors for osteoporosis, in which case tenofovir AF might be a preferable option.

PrEP prescriptions should not exceed a 90-day supply, as it is critical to confirm a continued HIV negative status before continuing therapy to avoid missing a new HIV infection. HIV testing (in addition to testing for other STIs) must be performed every 3 months (see Investigations). If an individual tests positive for HIV or presents with signs or symptoms consistent with an acute HIV infection, PrEP must be discontinued immediately to prevent development of drug resistance, and the patient should be assessed for appropriate HIV treatment.

At each follow-up visit, individuals should be asked about tolerability and adherence to PrEP, and the use of harm-reduction strategies should be reinforced (see Nonpharmacologic Choices).

#### Off-Label and Investigative PrEP Therapy

#### On-Demand PrEP Therapy

An alternative to daily oral PrEP is “on-demand” PrEP, which consists of taking 2 tablets of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF 2–24 hours before first sexual exposure, followed by 1 pill daily until 48 hours after the last sexual activity.​[^[3]] On-demand PrEP was demonstrated to reduce HIV transmission by 86% in MSM in the IPERGAY study.​[^[23]] Frequency of PrEP use among these study participants suggested they engaged in sexual activity at least weekly; extrapolating these results to individuals who engage in less frequent sexual activity or those in other risk groups is uncertain. On-demand PrEP is an off-label use of emtricitabine/TDF in Canada and should be viewed as an alternative recommendation due to the lower quality of evidence to support its use.​[^[3]] Emtricitabine/tenofovir AF is not recommended for on-demand dosing. 

#### Long-Acting PrEP Therapy

Long-acting medications are under investigation for PrEP, including a long-acting cabotegravir IM injection, twice-yearly lenacapavir SC injection, a dapivirine intravaginal ring, an islatravir monthly oral capsule and a subdermal implant. Clinical studies investigating the feasibility, efficacy and safety of these options are ongoing. 

Cabotegravir has been found to be superior to daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in MSM and transgender women who have sex with men (66% reduction in HIV infection),​[^[24]] and in cisgender women who have sex with men (89% reduction, though total infections in this study were low).​[^[25]] Cabotegravir has not yet been approved for PrEP in Canada; however, it is approved for this indication in the United States.​[^[26]] Approved U.S. dosing consists of 600 mg IM injection administered monthly for the first 2 months (after an optional oral lead-in), followed by 600 mg IM every 2 months thereafter.​[^[27]]

#### Follow-Up and Monitoring Assessment for Patients on PrEP



#### Discontinuing PrEP

When the decision is made to discontinue daily oral PrEP, it is not clear how long a person needs to keep taking medication after a potential exposure before it can be safely stopped. HIV protection decreases over 7–10 days following discontinuation of PrEP.​[^[7]] Guidelines suggest MSM with a long duration of PrEP adherence may require only 2 additional days of therapy following their last exposure.​[^[9]] However, in the absence of better evidence, individuals with other risks (e.g., PWID, women) may take PrEP for up to 28 days, based on extrapolation of data from PEP.​[^[9]]

The optimal timing for HIV testing following discontinuation of PrEP is unknown. Since PrEP may delay the detection of HIV antibodies, it is suggested that HIV testing at 8 weeks is reasonable.​[^[9]]

#### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, Occupational (PEP)

#### Introduction

An occupational exposure to HIV can occur when there is a percutaneous injury (e.g., needle-stick, cut) or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with exposure to blood or other potentially infectious body fluid or tissue. Potentially infectious body fluids include pericardial, peritoneal, cerebrospinal and amniotic fluids, as well as any fluid that contains visible blood. Other body fluids (e.g., tears, urine, saliva, vomitus) are not infectious unless they contain visible blood.​[^[28]] Occupational exposures occur most commonly among workers in health-care or laboratory settings, though workers in other environments (e.g., first responders in the community) may experience unintentional exposures to HIV.

The risk of acquiring HIV infection following an occupational exposure is quite low, approximately 0.3% following a percutaneous injury and about 0.09% for mucous membrane exposure.​[^[6]] Primary prevention of occupational exposures through application of universal precautions, use of personal protection equipment and following safety practices in the workplace is advocated. However, if a worker does experience a significant percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to a potentially infectious body fluid, PEP may be administered to prevent HIV infection. Due to their similar routes of transmission, workers should also be assessed for possible hepatitis B and C exposure with hepatitis B postexposure prophylaxis and monitoring as indicated in accordance with practice guidelines.​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

It is recommended that health-care institutions have a policy for managing occupational exposures to blood-borne pathogens, which addresses exposure to HIV and other blood-borne pathogens (such as viral hepatitis); maintain ARV starter kits consisting of a 3–5 day supply of medication in emergency departments to permit rapid initiation of PEP.

Selection of PEP medications is based primarily on tolerability and convenience (e.g., number of doses per day, number of pills per dose) to optimize adherence. If the exposed person has underlying renal or hepatic issues or is taking other medications, consideration should be given to the safety, dosage adjustment requirements and drug interaction potential with PEP medications (see Table 5). PEP should be prescribed for 28 days.

There is a lack of evidence to demonstrate superiority of 3 drugs over 2 drugs for PEP, or for superior efficacy of one PEP regimen over another. Three-drug PEP regimens, consisting of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) plus a third ARV medication (e.g., integrase inhibitor [INSTI], protease inhibitor [PI] or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) are recommended based on extrapolation of efficacy in treatment of HIV infection and because newer ARV medications are well-tolerated and associated with low risk for serious toxicity.

The 3-drug PEP regimen recommended by practice guidelines for occupational exposures is emtricitabine/tenofovir DF plus raltegravir (an INSTI); alternative regimens are listed in Table 3. However, since the guidelines were last updated (in 2013), newer, better tolerated and/or more convenient ARV agents have become available, which have replaced older ARVs in some hospital PEP protocols. For example, some hospitals are using dolutegravir in place of raltegravir as part of their first-line regimen.

Drug interactions between PIs or NNRTIs and other medications are common and should be assessed in individuals who are taking other medications. Despite this, PI–based regimens may be preferred in cases where the source person is known to be HIV-positive and drug resistance is a concern. A single-tablet, once-daily regimen consisting of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is an alternative with lower pill burden; however, drug interactions are also common with this regimen due to cobicistat, which is a cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor. In cases where drug resistance or renal impairment are a concern, consultation with an HIV expert or specialist is recommended.

| Preferred regimen | Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (Truvada, generics) once daily | Dolutegravir (Tivicay)​[a] once dailyRaltegravir (Isentress) twice daily (or once daily if high dose formulation) |  |

#### Follow-Up and Monitoring for Patients on PEP

Institutional occupational health guidelines for PEP follow-up should be followed where available.

Re-evaluate exposed person within 72 hours of exposure to assess tolerability of PEP and consider HIV test results of source person, if available, to adjust PEP as necessary.

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:



Follow-up testing and assessment for the exposed person:



#### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, Non-Occupational (nPEP)

#### Introduction

Non-occupational exposures to HIV typically occur through sexual activity or injection drug use. nPEP may be provided to individuals who experience a moderate or high-risk non-occupational exposure (see Table 1) to prevent HIV infection.

#### Investigations​[3]​[5]







#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide the following counselling for the exposed person:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

nPEP is indicated for HIV-negative persons who present within 72 hours of having a moderate- or high-risk exposure (see Table 1) if the source person has a non-negligible risk of HIV infection (see Table 2). nPEP should be initiated within 72 hours of the exposure (ideally within 24 hours) or as soon as possible. nPEP is not normally indicated when the risk of transmission is low or if the source person has known HIV infection but is taking ARVs and has an undetectable HIV viral load, as there would be zero risk of transmission in this situation.

nPEP should be taken for 28 days and should be stopped early only if the source is found to be HIV-negative or is HIV-positive with an undetectable HIV viral load due to effective ARVs. Individuals should be supported for optimal adherence to complete the full 28 days of therapy and encouraged to report any adverse effects so they can be managed or have their nPEP therapy switched if necessary. 

A variety of 3-drug nPEP regimens can be considered. There is no evidence to suggest one regimen is superior to another, so selection is based on tolerability, cost, drug interaction potential and patient preference. Therapeutic options for nPEP can be found in Table 4. Regimens should consist of 2 N[t]RTIs plus a third ARV medication; first-line options include:​[^[3]]

Follow-up testing and assessment for the exposed person:



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

When a pregnant person experiences a possible exposure to HIV or has ongoing high risk of exposure, a full discussion of the risks and benefits of (n)PEP or PrEP is warranted during shared decision-making. The risk of HIV transmission from birthing parent to child is very high if the birthing parent experiences an acute HIV infection during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[^[31]] Because risk factors may be under-reported, PrEP should be offered to those who feel they may be at risk of HIV acquisition.​[^[32]] The CDC guidelines include guidance for use of PrEP for people considering becoming pregnant, during pregnancy and breastfeeding.​[^[4]] For more information, see “Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding” in HIV Infection: Treatment.

#### Choices during Pregnancy

Risks associated with the use of antiretroviral medications during pregnancy depend on the duration of exposure, timing during pregnancy and which medications are used. Product labelling indicates emtricitabine/tenofovir DF can be used during pregnancy at standard doses.​[^[33]]

Data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry indicates no increased risk of birth defects among infants born to HIV-infected person who took dolutegravir, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, raltegravir or ritonavir-boosted darunavir during pregnancy.​[^[34]]

Elvitegravir/cobicistat should not be used due to potential subtherapeutic drug levels during pregnancy with standard dosing.​[^[32]]

There is limited data on pregnancy outcomes among people who used PrEP; however, clinical trial data evaluating emtricitabine and tenofovir DF suggest no evidence of increased risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, congenital malformations or infant mortality.​[^[35]] If PrEP is utilized in pregnancy, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is recommended and patients should be reminded that excellent adherence is essential in order for it to be effective.​[^[32]]

For PEP, preferred regimens during pregnancy include emtricitabine/tenofovir DF plus either dolutegravir 50 mg once daily, raltegravir 400 mg BID or darunavir 800 mg (boosted with ritonavir 100 mg) once daily:



#### Choices during Breastfeeding

The risk of HIV transmission from birthing parent to child is very high if the patient experiences an acute HIV infection during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[^[31]] Breastfeeding is not normally recommended for HIV-positive individuals in Canada, even if the patient is on effective antiretroviral therapy, due to the lack of evidence regarding the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk in patients with an undetectable viral load. Discussions regarding the use of PrEP or (n)PEP in those who are breastfeeding should compare the risk of the individual contracting HIV infection (if they do not take PrEP or (n)PEP) and the risks to the baby (potential toxicity due to antiretroviral medication exposure through breast milk; risk of HIV transmission through breast milk if the person seroconverts while breastfeeding). In some cases where (n)PEP is being considered, cessation of breastfeeding may be warranted.​[^[6]]

 While the product monograph does not recommend emtricitabine/tenofovir DF use during breastfeeding,​[^[33]] Canadian guidelines suggest that PrEP may be used in those who are breastfeeding where benefits outweigh the risks.​[^[3]] 

It is unknown whether raltegravir and darunavir are transferred into breast milk.​[^[36]] Emtricitabine and tenofovir DF are both transferred into breast milk at low to moderate levels.​[^[36]]

Canadian guidelines recommend against breastfeeding if nPEP is required,​[^[3]] while other guidelines suggest breastfeeding should not be a contraindication to PEP when needed, though the risks and benefits to the baby should be discussed with the person who is breastfeeding to ensure informed shared decision-making.​[^[6]]
