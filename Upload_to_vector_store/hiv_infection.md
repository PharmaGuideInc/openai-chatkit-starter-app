#### Introduction

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a chronic viral infection that, left untreated, ultimately leads to death from opportunistic infections and/or specific cancers associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, since the advent and availability of highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the mid-1990s, the prognosis has shifted dramatically.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] The primary goal of therapy, to preserve the health of the individual living with HIV, is readily achievable with current cART, and in most cases HIV can be considered a chronic manageable condition. The benefits of cART are maximized when it is given continuously, starting as early as possible in the course of HIV infection, to avert damage to the immune system and irreversible organ damage caused by chronic inflammation.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

In addition, widespread use of cART has significant benefits at the population level by preventing new HIV infections.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]] In conjunction with education and other prevention strategies, expanded use of cART in the “treatment as prevention” model has the potential to significantly impact the HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis is critical to achieving the proven benefits of early HIV treatment at both the individual and societal levels. This highlights the need to expand HIV testing and incorporate it as part of standard health care for all sexually active adults. This chapter discusses treatment of adult patients with chronic HIV infection as diagnosed by a positive HIV antibody/antigen test; for information related to screening patients who do not have an established diagnosis of HIV infection, see HIV Infection: Prevention.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antiretroviral Therapy

#### General approach to antiretroviral therapy

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is recommended in all individuals living with HIV with detectable HIV viremia. Irrespective of CD4 count, HIV infection confers an increased risk for non-AIDS-associated cancers, coronary artery disease, hepatic and renal disease, and other conditions, possibly due to uncontrolled viral replication and chronic immune activation.​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

Durability of the treatment effect is related to the prevention of drug resistance and this is achieved only with consistent suppression of viral replication. Long-term nonprogression of the disease can be expected if the plasma viral load is maintained below the level of detection on a long-term basis; however, the clinical significance of a viral load result between 40 and 200 copies/mL is uncertain.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] Therefore, the goal of plasma viral load suppression is HIV RNA <40 copies/mL (for polymerase chain reaction assays), whereas the inability to maintain levels <200 copies/mL is considered virologic failure.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] 

Effective control of HIV infection with cART reduces the incidence of opportunistic infections and certain cancers and prolongs life.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] It also decreases infectivity and lowers the risk of HIV transmission from pregnant patients to their infants, between drug-using partners and among sexual contacts.​[^[9]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] A systematic review by the Public Health Agency of Canada demonstrated a negligible risk of sexual transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive partner who is adherent to antiretroviral therapy and who has a consistently suppressed viral load (<200 copies/mL).​[^[20]]

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy is associated with significantly improved survival.​[^[5]] Initiation of antiretroviral therapy should be considered more urgently in symptomatic patients; those with a history of an AIDS-defining illness; those with HIV-associated nephropathy, hepatitis B or C co-infection or newly diagnosed malignancy; those with HIV-uninfected sexual partners; and in pregnant patients.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

Long-term treatment with certain cART may be associated with metabolic complications and reduced bone mineral density; however, these effects are offset by the demonstrated improvement in survival and significantly reduced rates of major cardiovascular, hepatic and renal events associated with continuous antiretroviral therapy.​[^[7]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

#### Recommended cART regimens

**Combination antiretroviral therapy** (cART) is the standard of care for initial therapy and is defined as a combination of at least 3 active antiretroviral drugs or, in specific cases, 2 antiretroviral drugs.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] The cART regimens recommended for first-line therapy consist of 2 **nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors** (N[t]RTIs) plus either:



| Regimen | Regimen Examples | N[t]RTIs: First and Second Drug | Plus Third (± Fourth) Drug | Or (Single-Tablet) Triple Therapy |

#### Considerations affecting choice of cART regimen

When selecting the antiretroviral regimen, consider individual patient characteristics (e.g., pretreatment HIV RNA level and CD4 count, HIV genotypic drug resistance test results, HLA-B*5701 status), presence of comorbidities (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease), pregnancy or potential for pregnancy, and regimen-specific considerations (e.g., adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, drug coverage, pill burden and dosing frequency) (see Table 3). Nonadherence to therapy promotes the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains and is the most important remaining challenge in the management of HIV infection.​[^[23]]​[^[24]] Counselling and support are critical to ensure ongoing adherence.​[^[24]]

Drug interactions are an important consideration whenever starting or stopping antiretrovirals or other drugs.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] In addition to toxicity, reduced serum drug levels can be an important consequence. Suboptimal antiretroviral levels not only reduce efficacy but may also promote resistance. All PIs and NNRTIs are metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system and consequently are associated with many drug interactions. Unboosted integrase inhibitors have fewer clinically significant drug interactions; however, GI absorption can be impaired in the presence of polyvalent cations (e.g., aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium), potentially resulting in subtherapeutic plasma levels of the integrase inhibitor. N[t]RTIs are not metabolized by CYP450 but other interactions can occur.

If a patient experiences unmanageable drug toxicity, simultaneous cessation of *all* antiretroviral medications is recommended prior to starting a new cART regimen. Avoid decreasing the dosage or stopping only 1 or 2 medications, as this can promote the development of resistance.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[25]]

In the past, planned treatment interruptions (“drug holidays”) were proposed as a strategy to reduce long-term toxicity and treatment cost for patients; however, the risk of opportunistic infections and death was higher in patients randomized to episodic treatment interruptions based on CD4 count as compared with continuous cART in the SMART study.​[^[7]] For this reason, treatment interruptions are not recommended.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

A confirmed rebound in plasma viral load implies treatment failure or nonadherence. If adherence is confirmed, drug resistance testing should be performed and the cART regimen should be selected based on the patient’s antiretroviral therapy history and previous drug resistance results.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

#### Pre- and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

For a discussion regarding pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, see HIV Infection: Prevention.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### HIV Infection and Pregnancy

Optimal management of HIV in pregnancy requires consultation with a physician with expertise in this area. Prepregnancy considerations are beyond the scope of this chapter; for more information, see the Canadian HIV Pregnancy Planning Guidelines.

Considerations during pregnancy should include optimal therapy of the pregnant patient, results of resistance testing, risk of perinatal transmission of HIV, changes in pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals during pregnancy, and possible teratogenic and other effects of cART on the developing fetus.​[^[26]] All pregnant patients should be offered cART with a discussion of its risks and benefits.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy

A cART regimen in pregnancy should be designed based on the results of drug resistance testing and should preferably include 2 **N[t]RTIs** and either a ritonavir**-boosted PI** or an unboosted **integrase inhibitor**.​[^[26]] Two-drug regimens are not recommended during pregnancy.

Preferred N[t]RTIs include abacavir/​lamivudine (coformulated) (if the gestational parent’s HLA-B*5701 test is negative), emtricitabine/​tenofovir DF (coformulated), lamivudine plus tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine/​tenofovir AF (coformulated). Tenofovir DF should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. Twice-daily coformulated lamivudine/​zidovudine is an alternative NRTI in pregnancy.

The preferred ritonavir-boosted PI in pregnancy is twice daily darunavir**/**ritonavir. Cobicistat results in insufficient PI drug levels during the second and third trimesters and thus should not be used as a pharmacokinetic booster during pregnancy.

The preferred integrase inhibitor in pregnancy is dolutegravir. Dolutegravir is dosed once daily, rapidly decreases viral load, is well tolerated and associated with fewer drug interactions than boosted PIs.​[^[26]] Raltegravir is dosed twice daily in pregnancy and is an alternative integrase inhibitor. In a large study in Botswana, dolutegravir use around the time of conception was associated with a slightly higher risk of fetal neural tube defects (0.3% with dolutegravir vs. 0.1% with other antiretrovirals).​[^[27]] However, updated data from the same study have shown rates of neural tube defects that are not significantly different from those with nondolutegravir regimens.​[^[28]] Dolutegravir can be considered before and during pregnancy after discussing potential risks and benefits with the patient and ensuring adequate folic acid supplementation.​[^[26]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

Elvitegravir/cobicistat is not recommended for initial use in pregnancy due to low elvitegravir drug levels. Injectable cabotegravir is also not recommended due to its long half-life and lack of safety data in pregnancy. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of bictegravir in pregnancy.

Use of other antiretroviral agents should be considered on an individual basis, in consultation with an expert in the management of HIV during pregnancy.

#### Choices during Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding by patients living with HIV is not recommended in Canada due to the risk of HIV transmission to the child (risk <1% but not zero) and readily available infant formulas. Therefore, HIV treatment recommendations for the breastfeeding parent are the same as for the general population of patients living with HIV.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
