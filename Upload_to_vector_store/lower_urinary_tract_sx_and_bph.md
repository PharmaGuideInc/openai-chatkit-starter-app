#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Alpha1-adrenergic antagonists and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are all useful in improving symptoms (see Figure 1, Table 3).

Clinical trials have been mixed on the association between heart failure and alpha blocker or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy. A 2021 Canadian study found that patients >66 years of age with BPH who were exposed to alpha-blocker or 5-alpha reductase inhibitor therapy (alone or in combination) had an increased association with new cardiac failure, with the highest risk for those exposed to nonselective alpha blockers alone.​[^[6]] The implications of these findings are not completely clear since BPH and cardiovascular issues often coexist in this age group, but prescribers should weigh the benefit versus risk before use.

#### Alpha1-adrenergic Receptor Antagonists

These agents are commonly used to block alpha1-adrenergic receptors that mediate smooth muscle activity in the bladder neck, prostate and urethra, reducing the dynamic component of bladder outlet obstruction. Over a period of days to weeks, urinary flow rates may improve by 1–3 mL/sec and symptom scores by 1–3 points. The effectiveness of the alpha blockers is not influenced by prostate size.

Uroselectivity refers to the degree to which different drugs specifically target the alpha1-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the urinary tract (alpha1A, alpha1D) rather than those that are found in vascular smooth muscle (alpha1B). Doxazosin and terazosin are nonuroselective; alfuzosin is moderately uroselective; silodosin and tamsulosin are highly uroselective.

To avoid first-dose syncope, start doxazosin and terazosin at a low dosage and gradually increase until symptomatic improvement or intolerance occurs. If patients are tolerating tamsulosin well but voiding hasn’t improved as much as anticipated, the dose can be doubled. Dose titration is not necessary with alfuzosin or silodosin.

Severity of side effects of alpha blockers is influenced by their uroselectivity. These include dizziness (10–20%), headache (15%), asthenia (5–15%) and nasal congestion (5–10%). Decreased ejaculate volume develops in up to 90% of patients taking silodosin and 5–10% taking tamsulosin but ejaculatory dysfunction is uncommon with alfuzosin.​[^[7]] Alpha blockers may potentiate other antihypertensive medications, and caution should be used when they are added to an ongoing regimen, particularly in older patients. Silodosin and tamsulosin have fewer systemic side effects such as hypotension because of their greater uroselectivity. Adverse events from doxazosin and terazosin may be reduced by taking them at bedtime.

Alpha blockers, especially tamsulosin, have been linked to intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS).​[^[8]] Ask patients if they have previously taken or are currently using any alpha blockers before they undergo cataract surgery. If so, this should be disclosed to their ophthalmologist.

Although there are differences in the adverse event profiles of these agents, all 5 have equal clinical effectiveness. Choice of agent depends upon the side effect profile and on the patient’s comorbidities and individual tolerance. Potential drug interactions and provincial drug coverage may also play a role in decision-making. In patients with no significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and with the ability to understand and carry out dose titration, doxazosin and terazosin are cost-effective alpha blockers. Generic alfuzosin and tamsulosin are now similarly priced and may be more convenient to use.

#### 5-Alpha-reductase Inhibitors

Finasteride inhibits type II and dutasteride types I and II isoenzymes of 5-alpha-reductase, which blocks the metabolism of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.​[^[9]] The net effect is a decrease in intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone and a progressive reduction in prostatic volume of 20–30%. This reduces the static component of bladder outlet obstruction over a period of several months to years and may be accompanied by an improvement in urinary flow rates of 1–2 mL/sec and symptom scores of 1–2 points.

The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors work best in patients with large prostates (≥40 mL). Because of their site specificity, there is a low incidence of side effects (3–4% sexual dysfunction). There is an increased risk of self-harm and depression in patients ≥66 years of age treated with a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, but no increased risk of suicide.​[^[10]] Within 6 months of initiation, these drugs decrease serum PSA levels by approximately 50% in patients with BPH and may partially suppress serum PSA in those with prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in patients taking this class of drugs, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 6 months after starting treatment and monitored periodically thereafter. Some suggest doubling the PSA level in patients taking a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor in order to provide a more accurate PSA number for prostate cancer screening.​[^[11]]

Neither finasteride nor dutasteride is approved for prevention of prostate cancer in Canada; however both agents have been shown to reduce the overall risk of prostate cancer.​[^[12]]​[^[13]] Patients with BPH who are concerned about prostate cancer should be informed about the proven benefits (beyond reducing symptoms and progression of BPH) of using a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. At the same time, patients taking a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor who are diagnosed with prostate cancer may be more likely to be diagnosed with a high-grade cancer, possibly owing to a detection bias caused by the reduction in prostate volume and the improved performance of the PSA test. The prediagnostic use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors appears to be associated with delayed prostate cancer diagnosis and increased mortality risk.​[^[11]]

#### Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors

Tadalafil is the only PDE5 inhibitor indicated for the daily management of erectile dysfunction, LUTS associated with BPH or both.​[^[14]] It works by causing smooth muscle relaxation in and around the prostate, and several trials have shown the benefits of 5 mg daily based upon a reduction in total IPSS. There is some controversy as to whether there is added benefit combining PDE5 inhibitors with alpha blockers.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] Patients taking nitrate-based drugs, such as nitroglycerin, should not take tadalafil, as it can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure.

#### Alpha1-adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Combination Therapy

The combination of an alpha blocker and a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor is an appropriate and effective treatment for patients with LUTS associated with demonstrable prostatic enlargement. Various pairings have been used successfully.​[^[17]] One strategy involves giving patients who are successfully treated with combination therapy the option of discontinuing the alpha blocker after 6–12 months. If symptoms recur, the alpha blocker is restarted.

Combination of alpha blockers with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may result in an undesirable hypotensive effect. It is recommended that patients be stabilized on an alpha-blocker before introducing a PDE5 inhibitor.

Antimuscarinic (e.g., fesoterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine) and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist agents (e.g., mirabegron) alone or in combination with an alpha blocker may be effective in patients with predominant or persistently bothersome overactive bladder symptoms.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] These agents are associated with a small risk of urinary retention (≤3%), which tends to occur during the first month of treatment.​[^[18]] To avoid drug-induced urinary retention, use these agents with caution in patients with residual urine volume >200 mL and a history of spontaneous episodes of urinary retention. Some effort may be required to find the agent that works best with the least adverse effects in an individual patient. Some insurance will not reimburse mirabegron except in patients whose symptoms of urgency, urgency incontinence and urinary frequency do not respond to or have an intolerance to an adequate trial of an antimuscarinic. More information on the use of antimuscarinics for bladder symptoms can be found in Urinary Incontinence in Adults.

#### Antidiuretic Hormone Analogues

Desmopressin is a replacement or supplement for endogenous antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In patients with problematic nocturnal polyuria who do not have another correctable cause and who do not respond to nonpharmacologic strategies, low-dose oral desmopressin can significantly reduce the number of nocturnal voids.​[^[20]] It increases water reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney. Hyponatremia can be a problem and serum sodium levels should be monitored.

#### Phytotherapeutic Agents

Saw palmetto is the most popular and studied plant extract used to reduce symptoms related to BPH. Some patients report a favourable response, but published trials fail to show any objective benefit greater than placebo.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Identification and pharmacokinetics of active ingredients are often unclear in phytotherapeutic mixtures. Until more information regarding their mode of action and long-term efficacy and safety becomes available in quality studies, their use is not recommended.​[^[24]]

#### Procedures

Surgical intervention may be indicated in the following circumstances:



While transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and retropubic prostatectomy are traditional means of dealing with an enlarged and obstructing prostate gland, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) and various forms of prostate vaporization (e.g., laser, plasma button) are useful in some patients (see Table 2). Prostate tissue–eliminating procedures are associated with better medication discontinuation, resumption and de novo initiation rates compared to tissue-necrosing interventions.​[^[25]] There are many different surgical options, and their availability will vary depending on hospital resources and training of staff. Local urologists should be consulted.

Long-term catheter drainage or clean intermittent catheterization are appropriate options for patients who are not candidates for any other intervention.

| Procedure | Description/Efficacy | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prostate vaporization | ≤24 h hospital stay; 80% reduction in symptoms. | Little or no bleeding. | Preferred technique for patients requiring anticoagulants or with uncorrected coagulopathies; decreased fluid absorption. |
| Retropubic prostatectomy | Open surgery; similar efficacy to TURP. | Retrograde ejaculation (80–90%); bladder neck contracture (2–3%). | For very enlarged prostates or when required to correct concomitant bladder pathology (bladder stones, diverticula). |
| Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) | Outpatient; 80% reduction in symptoms. | Retrograde ejaculation (6–55%). | Useful for small prostates. |
| Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) | 1–2 days in hospital; gold standard for efficacy (85–90% reduction in symptoms). | Retrograde ejaculation (50–95%), urethral strictures (3%), bladder neck contracture (3–10%), re-resection (3–8%). | For moderately enlarged prostates. |
