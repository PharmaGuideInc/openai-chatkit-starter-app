#### Pathophysiology

Burns encompass a spectrum of tissue injury resulting in both local and systemic responses.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Excessive heat to the skin creates a local reaction at the contact point and spreads in 3 specific zones (Jackson’s Model):



Systemic reactions generally occur with severe burns and can include shock, muscle damage, and cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions (smoke inhalation).​[^[2]]​[^[5]]

Burns can be caused by:​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]



The potential seriousness of a burn is related to:​[^[2]]​[^[3]]



Patient factors that increase the risk of burn wound infections or delayed burn healing include:​[^[1]]



Characteristics of burn wounds are summarized in Table 1.  (See photos: , ,  and ).

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a section of skin with visible dermatological features. The skin appears to have a linear arrangement of small, crusted lesions. These lesions are brownish and slightly raised. The surrounding skin is erythematous, indicating redness and possible inflammation. The pattern and appearance suggest a possible case of linear lichen planus or a similar dermatological condition. The skin texture around the lesions appears slightly wrinkled or stretched. There are no visible signs of infection such as pus or significant swelling.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a hand with a prominent raised scar on the back. The scar appears to be hypertrophic or possibly a keloid, characterized by its elevated, thickened appearance. It is located over the knuckles and extends along the back of the hand. The surrounding skin appears normal in color and texture. The image is likely intended to illustrate a type of scar formation that can occur after injury or surgery.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a human hand with a noticeable skin condition. The palm has a large, irregularly shaped area of lighter skin, which appears to be a blister or burn. The surrounding skin on the fingers and palm is red, suggesting inflammation or irritation. The hand is positioned palm-up against a neutral background, likely for medical examination or documentation. The condition depicted could be consistent with a burn injury, possibly a second-degree burn, characterized by blistering and redness.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a finger with a skin lesion. The lesion is located on the dorsal side of the finger, near the middle phalanx. It appears as an ulcerated area with a red, raw center, indicating possible tissue loss or erosion. The surrounding skin is slightly raised and has a whitish border, suggesting inflammation or possible infection. The skin around the lesion appears shiny and swollen, which may indicate edema. The finger is wearing a ring, but it does not seem to be affecting the lesion. The background is a plain blue surface. This type of lesion could be indicative of various conditions, such as an infection, ulcer, or other dermatological issue.

| Old Nomenclature | Class | Examples | Appearance | Healing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First degree | Superficial (epidermis only) | Mild sunburn; scalds from liquids; low-intensity heat | Dry; pink/discoloured; blanches with pressure; initially painful; some edema; no blisters; skin remains intact so infection is not a concern | 3–7 days; no scarring |
| Second degree | Superficial partial thickness (epidermis, upper dermis) | Scald (spill, splash); brief contact with flame or hot object; more severe sunburn | Moist; weeping; red/discoloured; small blisters; blanches with pressure; extreme pain | 7–21 days; potential pigment changes; generally no long-term scarring |
|  | Deep partial thickness (epidermis, deep dermis with some hair follicle, sweat gland damage) | Scald; oil or grease; longer contact with flame or steam | Wet or waxy; dry; colour variable (red, patchy white); fluid filled blisters; no blanching with pressure; pain only with pressure | >21 days; risk of scarring and contracture (skin tightening) |
| Third degree | Full thickness (epidermis, dermis to subcutaneous layer) | Scald (immersion); super heated steam; flame; concentrated chemicals; high-voltage electrical | Dry; waxy white to leathery grey to charred and black; no blanching with pressure; painless (due to destruction of nerves) | Never heals spontaneously; requires surgery/graftsHigh risk of scarring; contractures (skin tightening); systemic and skin infection; fluid loss |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The size of a burn is measured as a proportion of total body surface area (TBSA). The Wallace “rule of nines” is one calculation method used (see Table 2). The patient’s palm and fingers are considered equal to about 1% of TBSA.​[^[4]] A second method is the Lund and Browder chart that uses different percentage points for the different sections of the body.​[^[2]]​[^[10]] This may be a more accurate method for children; an example can be found in Suggested Readings.

Self-management is appropriate for most superficial burns or superficial partial-thickness burns that involve <15% of TBSA in adults <40 years of age or <10% TBSA in children or in adults >40 years of age. Burns to the hands, face, eyes, ears, perineum or genitalia are not appropriate for self-management (see below).​[^[5]] 



Patients with even minor burns who have underlying conditions that put them at risk of infection or delayed healing, such as diabetes, social issues that increase the risk of treatment failure, or immunocompromised states (including drug-induced immunosuppression), may require close monitoring and follow-up.​[^[9]]

Assessment of burn patients is summarized in Figure 1.

| Body Part | % of Body Surface Area (Adult)​[a] | % of Body Surface Area (Infant/small child)​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head and neck | 9 | 18 |
| Both arms | 18 | 18 |
| Anterior trunk | 18 | 18 |
| Posterior trunk | 18 | 18 |
| Both legs | 36 | 28 |
| Genitalia/perineum | 1 |  |


#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Thermal burns are treated by removal of the causative agent to minimize further tissue damage. Cooling should be started as soon as possible for small burns as it can limit the extent of injury, decrease inflammation and provide some pain relief.​[^[4]]​[^[9]] The area can be cooled for up to 20 minutes with cool-to-touch tap water irrigations or application of cool tap water compresses.​[^[4]]​[^[9]] 

Chemical burns are treated by removing the causative agent and clothing that has become saturated with the chemical. Irrigate the burn area with copious amounts of lukewarm or cool water and transport the patient to the emergency room for further treatment.​[^[3]]​[^[5]]

Electrical burns are treated by first removing the source of electricity if safely possible and then immediately transporting the person to the emergency room for further treatment, as these burns are often more serious than they appear.​[^[5]]

Radiation burns are commonly caused by sun exposure and are treated in a similar manner to thermal burns (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage). 

**First Aid for Minor Burns**

First aid treatment of burns is dependent on the type of burn and the causative agent. Superficial or superficial partial-thickness burns caused by thermal agents or the sun are generally self-treatable. See Patient Assessment for information on which burns require immediate medical attention in an emergency care setting.

To apply first aid for superficial burns:​[^[4]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Skin Care Products: Anesthetics, Dermatitis and Dry Skin, First Aid.

#### Antibacterial Agents

Topical antiseptics are not routinely recommended due to limited and poor quality evidence.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Topical antibiotics are not recommended for routine use on burns unless infection is present. It is important to monitor the patient for signs of infection and to treat if needed.​[^[13]] Silver sulfadiazine (SSD), a broad spectrum topical antibiotic, has historically been used to prevent burn wound infections. However, systematic reviews suggest that the use of SSD on superficial or partial thickness burns may result in delayed wound or burn healing.​[^[5]] 

Oral antibiotics have not been found to be effective in preventing burn wound infections.​[^[6]]​[^[12]]​[^[14]]

#### Pain and Itch Control Agents

Usual doses of nonprescription analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) are often sufficient to control pain in minor burns. ASA should be avoided in superficial partial-thickness or deep partial-thickness burns because platelet inhibition poses a risk of bleeding in the presence of open wounds.​[^[8]] Deeper burns with open areas often require opioids for adequate pain management.​[^[8]]​[^[12]] Virtual reality has been utilized during dressing changes to decrease pain and anxiety through distraction of the patient.​[^[13]]

Local anesthetics are a common ingredient in topical products marketed for the relief of minor pain and itching associated with superficial burns, although there is no evidence to substantiate their effectiveness. Lidocaine and benzocaine commonly cause contact dermatitis, while pramoxine has low sensitizing potential. There is a risk of systemic absorption if local anesthetics are applied to blistered or large areas of skin. Camphor, menthol and phenol are counterirritants thought to have a cooling effect on the burned area and may provide some relief from itching. However, there is no evidence available for the use of counterirritants in the treatment of minor burns.

Itching is common during the healing phase, particularly in partial thickness burns. **Moisturizing lotions** relieve itching by restoring barrier function and colloidal oatmeal baths may provide symptomatic relief of itch in less severe burns.​[^[14]] Systemic antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, cetirizine and loratadine may be helpful in some patients whose itching is more bothersome.​[^[8]]​[^[15]] Some evidence indicates that gabapentin and pregabalin may be an option for patients with neuropathic pain and itch that has not responded to moisturizers and antihistamines.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] Avoid the use of topical antihistamines in this situation since the risk of sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis increases with prolonged use. The area will also be more sensitive to sun and extremes of heat and cold for up to a year depending on the severity of the burn. High SPF (30 or greater) **sunscreens** should be used until the wound has healed completely, to prevent permanent hyperpigmentation from repeated injury due to sun radiation​[^[14]] (see Prevention and Treatment of Sun-induced Skin Damage). 

#### Other Agents

Various types and formulations of topical honey (including processed and unprocessed) have been shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. A systematic review found that topical honey interventions resulted in faster healing of some burns when compared to some conventional treatments.​[^[11]]​[^[17]] Further studies are required as large, randomized trials are limited.

The evidence is inconclusive regarding whether aloe vera gel or dressings improve outcomes for acute or chronic wounds including burns.​[^[11]] A systematic review indicated that aloe vera improved healing time in partial thickness burns (second degree burns) but more robust studies are needed to conclusively determine effectiveness.​[^[18]]

**Tetanus prophylaxis** is recommended for deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns if it has been more than 5 years since the last booster. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that tetanus prophylaxis also be implemented if it is uncertain when the patient’s last booster was given or if the patient has not received the full 3 doses of the primary immunization series.​[^[19]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 3 provides a monitoring plan for burn therapy.

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pain | Monitor pain level every 4–6 h for the first few days and then daily. Monitor the level of pain based on a scale of 0–10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain.Assess whether pain interferes with sleep or usual daily activities. | The patient’s worst pain score should be less than 5. Higher pain scores interfere with sleep, daily activities and mood. | Patients whose pain is not responding adequately to regular (Q4–6H) doses of nonprescription analgesics may require further assessment and/or treatment (burn may be more severe than initially assessed).Opioid analgesics may be required if burn is more severe. |
| Burn healing | Monitor daily for 2–3 days, then weekly until healing is complete (usually 2 wk). Maximal scar resolution may take longer: monitor every 4–6 wk. | Sunburn erythema should be markedly reduced by 48 h. Peeling is normal (use moisturizers to prevent drying and peeling of the skin). | Patients require further assessment and/or treatment if healing is not complete within 7 days or if there is a significant risk or signs of infection or scarring. |
| Itching | Monitor every 4–6 h for itching on a daily basis for 5–7 days.Consider oral antihistamines for itching not responding to supportive measures such as moisturizing lotions, cool compresses or bathing. | Itching does not interfere with sleep or normal daily activities. | If itching does not respond to oral antihistamines or appears to worsen despite treatment, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Infection(swelling; surrounding discoloration that is tender to touch; red or purple streaks from the wound; pus; fever; swollen or tender lumps in the groin or armpit) | Monitor daily for signs of infection (assess at each dressing change if appropriate). | No signs or symptoms of infection noted before healing is complete.Risk is low after this point. | If signs and symptoms of infection are observed at the burn site, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for assessing and managing burn injuries. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Step:**
   - "Patient presents with burn"
   - Proceed to "Assess severity"

2. **Severity Assessment:**
   - Two main branches:
     - **Superficial or superficial partial-thickness burns** (minimal number of small blisters covering limited skin area, see Table 1 and Table 2)
     - **Deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burns** (see Table 1)

3. **Superficial or Superficial Partial-Thickness Burns:**
   - **Age Consideration:**
     - If "<5 y or >60 y" → Yes: Refer to emergency care
     - No: Continue assessment
   - **Involvement of Specific Areas:**
     - Face, ear, eyelid, inner surface of arm, hands, feet, genitals, perineum, large surface area, or circumferential area
     - Yes: Refer to emergency care
     - No: Continue assessment
   - **Type of Burn:**
     - Chemical, electrical, or inhalation burn
     - Yes: Refer to emergency care
     - No: Continue assessment
   - **Underlying Medical Conditions:**
     - Conditions that may increase risk of infection or delay healing (e.g., diabetes, chronic alcohol abuse, immunosuppressed)
     - Yes: Patient requires close monitoring and follow-up
     - No: Proceed to self-treatment

4. **Self-Treatment Recommendations:**
   - Cool compresses
   - Pain control (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
   - Itch control (e.g., oral antihistamines, moisturizers)
   - Prevent water loss/restore barrier function (skin protectants/moisturizers)
   - Contact health-care practitioner if signs of infection (e.g., swelling, discoloration or streaking, pus, pain, fever)

5. **Deep Partial-Thickness or Full-Thickness Burns:**
   - Directly leads to "Refer to emergency care"

This flowchart guides the decision-making process for treating burns based on severity, location, type, and patient-specific factors.
