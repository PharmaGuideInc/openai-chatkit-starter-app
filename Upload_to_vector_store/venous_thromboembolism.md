#### Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disorder and affects up to 5% of the population during their lifetime.​[^[1]] The annual incidence of PE in the population is 1.29 per 1000 persons but this increases sharply with age.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Embolization of a DVT into the pulmonary arteries is felt to be the most common mechanism for a PE. Despite increased awareness of PE, it is the cause of death of up to 10% of hospitalized patients.​[^[1]]​[^[3]] Registry studies found up to 17% of patients die within 3 months of diagnosis,​[^[4]] although large randomized controlled trials observed this to be closer to 2%.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]] VTE is associated with lower health-related quality of life and long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome in up to 40% of DVT patients and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in 1–4% of patients after PE.​[^[9]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

This chapter addresses both the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE.

#### Investigations

The signs and symptoms of DVT, e.g., swelling and pain in the affected extremity, and PE, e.g., shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, are insensitive and nonspecific. To help stratify patient risk when PE or DVT are considered possibilities, it is widely recommended that a validated clinical rule (e.g., Wells​[^[12]] or Modified Geneva​[^[13]] scoring system) be applied after the history, physical exam and routine tests such as chest x-ray and ECG are completed. To select patients who require additional imaging procedures, the next test should be a D-dimer (fibrin degradation products). VTE can reliably be excluded without imaging tests for patients with pretest probabilities of low, moderate or “unlikely,” in combination with a negative D-dimer test.​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Further research supports the use of age-adjusted, or pretest clinical probability adjusted, D-dimer thresholds.​[^[16]] In all others, imaging is important for optimal management. The following tests should be selected based on availability and ease of use: 



A single image may confirm diagnosis, although repeat testing may be required in specific circumstances. If distal DVT (thrombosis in the calf veins) is diagnosed and symptoms are not severe, treatment may not be necessary. Repeat imaging at 1 week, and if no change, consider repeating 1 week later. If significant clot extension is identified, treatment is required.​[^[17]]

Screen for thrombophilia in patients <40 years of age with recurrent VTE or a family history.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### General Measures

The majority of patients with DVT can be treated as outpatients. Likewise, many patients with PE—best estimates are about 50% of all cases of PE—who do not have compromised cardiopulmonary function may also be treated as outpatients.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Ideally an organized outpatient treatment program should be utilized to ensure safe and effective patient management. Analgesics may be prescribed for pain. NSAIDs are effective but may increase the risk of bleeding, especially when used with anticoagulants. Start with acetaminophen, but opioids may be required for a few days. Other general measures are specific to DVT or PE.

#### Deep Vein Thrombosis



#### Pulmonary Embolism



#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Elastic Stockings and Compression Bandages

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a clinically important and frequent complication of DVT, developing in as many as 60% of patients after proximal DVT. The most prominent symptoms are chronic swelling and pain, discomfort when walking, and skin discoloration.​[^[22]] Precise prediction of which patients will develop PTS is not possible, although some data support a higher probability for those with extensive proximal vein DVT (involving the iliofemoral veins) or if DVT recurs. It was thought that graduated compression stockings that apply an ankle pressure of 30–40 mmHg and a lower pressure higher up the leg reduced the risk of PTS following DVT. This was shown not to be the case in a large, placebo-controlled trial.​[^[23]] The SOX study enrolled over 800 patients with DVT. The cumulative incidence of PTS was 14.2% in the active stocking group (30–40 mmHg compression stockings) and 12.7% in the placebo stocking group, which is not a statistically significant difference.

Graduated compression stockings can improve edema and pain in the acute stage of DVT. They can also relieve symptoms in patients who develop PTS, but they do not prevent the development of PTS. Use of compression stockings is not appropriate when there is pre-existing peripheral vascular disease.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic therapy options for treatment of VTE are presented in Table 2.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban can be used for treatment of VTE. Dabigatran and edoxaban should be used following 5–10 days of a parenteral anticoagulant, but apixaban and rivaroxaban can be used alone.​[^[5]] If the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin is used, it is recommended that parenteral anticoagulation is also used and continued for a minimum of 5 days or until the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥2 for 24–48 hours. When parenteral anticoagulation is required, either low molecular weight  heparin **(LMWH)**, fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin **(UFH)** can be used, but LMWH is recommended. LMWH may be used as an alternative to oral agents in circumstances in which they are contraindicated or ineffective. For example, patients admitted to hospital with significant comorbidities are often started on parenteral therapy until stable or discharged. ASA might be considered, but was the least effective agent in a network meta-analysis.​[^[24]]

The recommended duration of oral anticoagulation for treatment of DVT/PE is dependent on the risk of recurrence (see Figure 1). Treatment of a first episode in a patient with a transient risk factor should continue for 3 months.​[^[17]]​[^[26]] However, combined data from 2 randomized trials suggests that the risk for recurrence with transient risk factors other than surgery may approach the risk of unprovoked VTE.​[^[27]] Extending anticoagulant therapy might be discussed in some cases. In those with unprovoked VTE or irreversible risk factors, treatment with oral anticoagulants for an indefinite period may be considered because of lifelong increased risk of recurrence.​[^[17]]​[^[26]] The risk is highest in males. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as male or female. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients. Each patient should be considered individually*.) This risk should be balanced against the treatment-related risk of bleeding. Several tools are now available for this purpose, including the VTE-Predict rule and the CHAP rule.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] In patients with distal DVT treated with a DOAC, a randomized-controlled trial suggests 3 months is a better option than 6 weeks.​[^[30]]

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are small molecules that directly inhibit the active site of thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban). They have rapid onset of action, with peak drug levels in 3–4 hours, and relatively short half-lives of 7–14 hours. These drugs have few drug interactions and no significant food interactions.​[^[31]] Importantly, they are given in a fixed dose and no monitoring of anticoagulant effect is required. Most patients with acute DVT or PE can be initially treated with a DOAC. Compared with the combination of LMWH and a vitamin K antagonist, apixaban and rivaroxaban monotherapy were noninferior for prevention of recurrent VTE.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Like LMWHs, these drugs may not be appropriate for patients with renal insufficiency. The pivotal trials demonstrating their efficacy excluded patients with ClCr <30 mL/min, but evidence suggests safety of apixaban with a ClCr as low as 15 mL/min.​[^[32]] 

The management of major hemorrhage in patients taking these agents has been cited as a disadvantage. Studies in volunteers and clinical experience suggest prothrombin complex concentrates and activated prothrombin complex concentrates may be effective. An antidote specific to dabigatran (idarucizumab) is approved in the U.S. and Canada.​[^[33]] An antidote for the direct Xa inhibitors, andexanet alpha, is used in some institutions to reverse direct Xa inhibitors, but the cost is high.​[^[34]] In terms of overall bleeding risk, a meta-analysis demonstrated that the direct Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban) are associated with significantly lower risks of major hemorrhage and death from hemorrhage compared with vitamin K antagonists.​[^[35]] 

#### Low Molecular Weight Heparins

The pharmacokinetics of LMWHs are more predictable than those of UFH, and their elimination half-life is longer. These properties make weight-adjusted fixed dosing of SC LMWHs an excellent alternative to adjusted-dose IV UFH in the initial treatment of DVT and PE.​[^[36]] In addition, 1 systematic review suggests that 6 months of therapeutic doses of tinzaparin was more effective than vitamin K antagonist therapy in reducing the risk of PTS.​[^[37]] LMWHs, as a single daily dose, have been shown to be effective as initial treatment of DVT in outpatients.​[^[38]] 

#### Unfractionated Heparin

If **UFH** is used for the treatment of VTE, it is most commonly given by IV infusion. The dose is adjusted to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to a time that corresponds to a heparin anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.7. In general, this is an aPTT of 1.5–2.5 times control (target therapeutic range should be determined by an institution’s coagulation laboratory). A practical weight-based nomogram has been developed for adjusting IV UFH.​[^[39]] Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a relatively rare but serious complication. When suspected all exposure to heparin should cease immediately and alternative non-heparin and non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation should be initiated.

UFH is also effective by SC injection, either adjusted to an aPTT of 1.5–2.5 times control, as above, or as a fixed, weight-based dose (see Table 2).​[^[40]] To provide appropriate injection volumes of SC UFH, it is important to prescribe the 25 000 units/mL strength, which may not be widely available.

Subcutaneous administration of either UFH or LMWH should be avoided in patients with anasarca and in patients on vasopressors.​[^[41]] Determination of effective anti-Xa levels is recommended in such cases.

#### Vitamin K Antagonists

Warfarin is the most widely used vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in North America. Warfarin therapy is monitored using the INR, given in a dose to maintain the INR at 2–3. When therapy is initiated, the INR is measured frequently, then less often as it stabilizes. It is generally measured daily or every other day for the first week, then every 3 days for a week, then 1 or 2 times weekly, then every 2–4 weeks once stable. In patients on extended therapy with consistently stable INR results, testing up to 12 weeks apart may be appropriate.​[^[42]] While a less intense level of anticoagulation (INR 1.5–2) has been shown to be effective, it is less effective than the standard treatment (INR 2–3).​[^[43]] Useful initiating nomograms have been published.​[^[44]] It is recommended that dosage adjustments be made in a systematic and coordinated fashion.​[^[42]]

A common cause of poor anticoagulant control is drug interactions.​[^[42]] Consult a reliable drug interaction reference before using any drug in combination with warfarin. ASA and NSAIDs do not affect INR control but may contribute to bleeding by causing gastric irritation and, in the case of ASA, by inhibiting platelet function. Several herbal or alternative products interact with warfarin, e.g., ginkgo, ginseng and St. John’ wort. Advise patients to avoid using such products. Thrombosis Canada provides information that can be used for patient education.

The alternative VKA acenocoumarol (nicoumalone) is no longer available in Canada. 

#### Thrombolytics

Less than 10% of patients with VTE are potential candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolysis should probably not be considered in those with short life expectancy and poor functional status. The best results are obtained with recent thrombi (symptoms for <14 days). The potential benefit in PE and DVT should be weighed against the risk of bleeding at various sites, including intracranial hemorrhage.​[^[17]]

Though not approved by Health Canada for this indication, alteplase can be considered for selected patients with PE. In patients with hypotension who do not have a high risk of bleeding, thrombolytic therapy is suggested. Patients without hypotension who deteriorate clinically can also be considered for thrombolytic therapy if they have a low bleeding risk.​[^[45]]

Thrombolytics are rarely required for DVT and their use should generally be reserved for patients with life- or limb-threatening thrombosis and no bleeding-related contraindications.​[^[22]] There is no agreement on the appropriate dose or route of administration of alteplase for DVT. Some data suggest catheter-directed lysis may be superior to systemically administered thrombolysis. Technical expertise is required to administer the drug appropriately.​[^[22]] Thrombolytic-associated reductions in PTS and increased vein patency were seen in a randomized trial comparing catheter-directed thrombolysis added to standard therapy for iliofemoral DVT.​[^[46]] However, thrombolysis was associated with more bleeding complications and did not prevent recurrent events; mortality was no different between the 2 groups. In another trial of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis of acute proximal DVT, there was no reduction in post-thrombotic syndrome compared to anticoagulation alone.​[^[47]] More bleeding complications were again found in the thrombolysis group. A recent meta-analysis confirms these findings.​[^[45]] It is unclear whether the advantages outweigh the cost and risk of therapy, but therapy may be appropriate in carefully selected patients.

#### Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism

#### Introduction

VTE is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients; the frequency varies according to patients’ risk. The risk of VTE is probably increased in the presence of factors related to venous stasis and coagulopathy, but few of these factors have been demonstrated to increase postoperative risk of thrombosis; therefore, recommendations for thrombosis prophylaxis are currently based on the type of surgery (see Table 1). Certain acutely ill hospitalized medical patients (e.g., those with acute infection, heart failure or respiratory failure) may also be candidates for thrombosis prophylaxis.​[^[50]] Although many advocate the use of prediction tools to identify high-risk patients, these have generally not been reliable. Some clinical factors are indicative of high risk including a history of cancer, ICU admission, a central line and a history of prior VTE. However, ICU admission, older age and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index also predicted higher risk of major hemorrhage.​[^[51]] 

Duration of prophylaxis depends upon the surgery and medical condition. Prophylaxis should generally be continued for at least 10–14 days. In high-risk situations, such as hip/knee arthroplasty and some gynecologic procedures, prophylaxis has been suggested beyond discharge from hospital, especially in cases of early discharge or continued immobility. Further research is needed to develop criteria for selection of patients who require an extended duration of prophylaxis.

VTE is more common in patients with COVID-19 when they are hospitalized. Critically ill patients should receive standard thromboprophylaxis for VTE, and moderately ill patients with a low bleeding risk might benefit from therapeutic heparin. Postdischarge, the risk remains relatively high with limited data from a registry study suggesting potential benefit from anticoagulation There is no role for intermediate dose prophylaxis in COVID-19 in either the inpatient or outpatient setting.​[^[52]]​[^[53]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices (sleeves placed on the legs and inflated with a programmable pump) reduce the risk of VTE, though to a lesser degree than pharmacologic methods. Their use should be limited to clinical settings where the risk of bleeding is high (e.g., after neurosurgery). Some guidelines suggest the combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods in patients at high risk for VTE, but the quality of evidence is poor. Ensure proper use and adherence.

Interruption of the venous return to the lungs through the use of an inferior vena cava filter that prevents embolization should be considered in patients in whom anticoagulants have failed or are absolutely contraindicated. Retrievable filters are now available and are preferred over the permanent ones.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic options for prevention of VTE are presented in Table 3.

Dalteparin, enoxaparin and tinzaparin are low molecular weight heparins approved for both the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE.​[^[54]] Unfractionated heparin is effective as prophylaxis only for procedures with moderate risk. Fondaparinux is an indirect factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prophylaxis of VTE in high-risk orthopedic patients.​[^[55]] These agents may also prevent VTE with minimal risk of bleeding in older acute medical patients. If vitamin K antagonists are used, the dose is adjusted to target an INR of 2–3. Studies have demonstrated that ASA has efficacy and safety equal to LMWH or DOACs for the prevention of VTE following a total knee or total hip replacement surgery after an initial 5 days of LMWH or DOAC.​[^[56]]​[^[57]] Apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are DOACs that are as effective as LMWH for VTE prophylaxis following elective total hip or total knee replacement surgery. Indeed, apixaban and rivaroxaban have demonstrated superiority over enoxaparin.​[^[58]]​[^[59]] Prophylaxis should be used in most patients with cancer.​[^[60]] Options include LMWH injections or apixaban, the later shown to be very effective in ambulatory patients with a Khorana score of ≥2 during the first 6 months of cancer therapy.​[^[61]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Venous Thromboembolism and Pregnancy



#### Management during Pregnancy

For pregnant patients with acute VTE, **LMWH** is the anticoagulant of choice. **UFH** is used when LMWH is not available. LMWH induces less bone loss than UFH and can be used daily. UFH and LMWHs do not cross the placental barrier.​[^[63]]​[^[64]] It is unclear whether once- or twice-daily dosing of LMWH is better. Full treatment doses are recommended for the first month. It is unclear whether a dose reduction to 75% of a full dose after 1 month, or maintaining a full weight-adjusted dose for the duration of pregnancy is best. The treatment duration recommended is a minimum of 3 months, including at least 6 weeks postpartum.

The management of pregnant patients with a previous DVT or PE is controversial, but a recent randomized trial demonstrated that low doses of LMWH were as effective as weight-adjusted intermediate doses for the prevention of VTE in pregnant patients with a prior history of VTE.​[^[65]]

Warfarin is usually avoided during pregnancy because of the potential for teratogenic effects. Fondaparinux should be used in pregnant or breastfeeding patients only if other agents cannot be used. DOACs should not be used in pregnant or breastfeeding patients, as they have not been studied in these clinical contexts and both drugs cross the placenta and can be detected in breast milk.

Delivery options for patients on LMWH for the treatment of VTE are best considered in consultation with the treating physician and the obstetrician. Options include allowing spontaneous delivery without an epidural, inducing labour to enable management of LMWH withdrawal or performing a cesarean section without LMWH. If delivery is to occur in the first month of treatment for acute VTE, a retrievable inferior vena cava filter must be considered during the time LMWH is withheld. 

#### Management Postpartum and during Breastfeeding

Warfarin, SC **UFH** or **LMWH** may be used for about 6 weeks after delivery for secondary prevention. This applies to treatment doses used in patients with new VTE during pregnancy or lower prophylactic doses used for other indications.

Warfarin is safe in the postpartum period, and patients can breastfeed while being treated with warfarin, UFH or LMWH. The safety of DOACs during breastfeeding has not been demonstrated.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
