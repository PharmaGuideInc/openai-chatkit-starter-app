#### Introduction

Calcium is the most abundant cation found in the human body and its homeostasis is tightly regulated. Hypercalcemia is a common disorder that is most often asymptomatic due to gradual and mild elevations in serum calcium that are detected on routine blood work. The presence of malignancy should be suspected if hypercalcemia develops rapidly, calcium levels are very high or systemic symptoms are present. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the other common cause of increased serum calcium levels. Approximately 90% of patients with hypercalcemia have PHPT or hypercalcemia of malignancy.​[^[1]] Diagnostic and treatment considerations are reviewed in this chapter.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Mobilize

Hypercalcemia is exacerbated by immobilization. Ambulation in appropriate patients helps to reduce bone resorption and normalize serum calcium.​[^[1]]

#### Diet

Dietary changes rarely correct hypercalcemia. Patients with sarcoidosis and other granulomatous causes of hypercalcemia or those who have vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia may benefit from dietary calcium restriction. Limit the use of vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements or calcium-containing antacids in all patients.​[^[1]]​[^[4]]

#### Hemodialysis

If it is available and can be instituted promptly, hemodialysis (low or zero calcium bath) provides rapid correction of severe symptomatic hypercalcemia. It is of value in those with severe hypercalcemia and severe renal impairment or heart failure who could not safely tolerate hydration.​[^[1]]​[^[4]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### General Measures

#### Stop Offending Agents

If possible, discontinue offending agents (see drug-induced causes in Table 1) and replace with agents that do not exacerbate hypercalcemia.

#### Replace Fluids

Patients with hypercalcemia are often dehydrated as a result of a renal water-concentrating defect induced by hypercalcemia and by decreased fluid intake resulting from nausea and vomiting. The resulting reduced glomerular filtration rate limits the ability of the kidney to excrete calcium. Expansion of intravascular volume enhances renal calcium clearance. Hydration alone usually reduces serum calcium by 0.25 to 0.375 mmol/L over the first 24 hours.​[^[6]] This effect is transient unless additional treatments are instituted.​[^[1]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[6]] Serum magnesium and potassium may also decrease with hydration and should be monitored and replaced as needed. 

Patients with mild to moderate asymptomatic hypercalcemia should drink 3 L per day of noncaffeinated beverages to achieve and maintain euvolemia. Patients with moderate to severe symptomatic hypercalcemia should receive intravenous **normal saline** (0.9% NaCl) bolus of 1 to 2 litres and then a continuous infusion at 250–500 mL/hour, if safe to do so, until euvolemic and a urine output of 100–150 mL/h is maintained.​[^[1]]​[^[4]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Renal dysfunction is common among patients with hypercalcemia. Careful monitoring of hydration is essential, especially in older patients and those with pre-existing renal insufficiency or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as fluid overload can develop. Refer to Figure 1 for further information on the management of mild, moderate and severe hypercalcemia.

Use a loop diuretic (furosemide, ethacrynic acid) to treat fluid overload and heart failure as needed, but only after volume depletion is fully corrected. Loop diuretics can aggravate hypercalcemia by depleting extracellular fluid volume so routine use is discouraged. Thiazide diuretics are contraindicated because they impair calcium excretion.​[^[8]]

#### Normalize Serum Phosphate

Hypophosphatemia, seen mostly in primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, exacerbates hypercalcemia by increasing renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which consequently reduces bone formation, increases bone resorption and increases intestinal absorption of dietary calcium. **Oral** phosphates (1–2 g elemental phosphate/day) can be given safely in all patients, except those with renal insufficiency, to increase serum phosphate to the low normal range (0.8–1 mmol/L). Though rare, calcium phosphate can precipitate and cause serious organ damage (heart, kidney, lungs, blood vessels) if phosphate levels are increased to >1 mmol/L or if IV phosphate is administered.​[^[9]]​[^[10]]

#### Specific Measures

Table 2 lists the drugs used in the management of hypercalcemia.

#### Hypercalcemia due to Primary Hyperparathyroidism

Surgery to remove the parathyroid glands remains the first-line measure for control of primary hyperparathyroidism in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]​[^[13]] Medical management can be used for asymptomatic patients who do not meet established criteria for surgery.​[^[13]] Adequate hydration should be recommended and calcium intake should not be restricted. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected.​[^[14]] Antiresorptive therapy with a **bisphosphonate** or denosumab is usually reserved for patients with moderate to severe hypercalcemia or those who exhibit osteopenia.​[^[14]]​[^[15]]

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that is recommended for the reduction of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma and for the reduction of clinically significant hypercalcemia in patients with PH for whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated.​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Cinacalcet is also indicated for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis.

#### Hypercalcemia due to Malignancy

**Anticancer therapy** aimed at the underlying malignancy is the key to long-term calcium control, though not all patients are candidates. The bisphosphonates clodronate, pamidronate and zoledronic acid are effective for hypercalcemia of malignancy.​[^[19]] They should be used along with cancer therapy, if appropriate, in patients with moderate symptomatic hypercalcemia (>3 mmol/L) and patients with severe hypercalcemia (>3.5 mmol/L with or without symptoms).​[^[7]]​[^[20]]​[^[21]] 

For acute management, parenteral zoledronic acid 4 mg as a 15-minute infusion is the preferred treatment due to ease of use and superior efficacy as compared to the 2–4 hr infusion of pamidronate.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Reduction in calcium and improvement in symptoms with an IV bisphosphonate is generally seen within 24–72 hours with normalization of the corrected serum calcium occurring in 4–10 days. Bisphosphonates are usually given in conjunction with saline and if hypercalcemia is severe, they can be administered with calcitonin. For patients who respond, serum calcium levels can be maintained at acceptable levels for up to 5 weeks before re-treatment is required, with zoledronic acid exhibiting a longer duration of action versus pamidronate.​[^[6]] Redosing is indicated if the response is inadequate after 7 days. Patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic breast, lung, or prostate cancer benefit from reduced bone pain, decreased skeletal morbidity, and prevention of hypercalcemia recurrence with prolonged therapy.​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Clodronate has a short duration of action and is more costly. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of other bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate) for serum calcium control.​[^[22]] Premedication with acetaminophen 650 mg can help prevent bisphosphonate-induced fever.

Calcitonin rapidly reduces serum calcium levels in severe hypercalcemia; however, the response tends to abate within 48 hours and therefore is considered a bridging therapy.​[^[23]] Calcitonin treatment should be limited to 48–72 hours due to tachyphylaxis. Gallium is not available for use in Canada.

Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the bone resorption mediator RANKL, can be used as an alternative to bisphosphonate therapy and for hypercalcemia of malignancy that is refractory to IV bisphosphonate therapy. Denosumab is not cleared by the kidney and has no renal toxicity, making it useful in patients with impaired renal function who cannot take bisphosphonates.

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, e.g., prednisone 40–100 mg/day or equivalent for up to 1 week, may be useful in patients with lymphoma, myeloma, lymphoid leukemia and breast cancer. Corticosteroids inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by decreasing tumor production of locally active cytokines, in addition to having direct tumorolytic effects. Additionally, corticosteroids decrease calcitriol production and thus intestinal calcium absorption.

#### Hypercalcemia due to Granulomatous Diseases

Excess production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is characteristic of granulomatous diseases, e.g., sarcoidosis. Therapy includes restricting vitamin D and calcium intake and avoiding excessive exposure to sunlight. Corticosteroids may be used in acutely ill patients.​[^[1]]
