#### Pathophysiology

Sweating is essential for regulating body temperature. Sweat production increases in response to an increase in body temperature and produces a cooling of the body.​[^[1]] Normal body temperature is regulated through receptors in the hypothalamus that monitor the core temperature and skin receptors that monitor the external temperature. Sweat glands consist of a secretory coil in the dermis and a duct that transports sweat to the skin surface (see Figure 1). Failure of this regulating system to reduce body heat can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, hyperthermia and, in extreme cases, death.​[^[2]] Hyperhidrosis is classified as primary (unknown cause) or secondary (due to an underlying medical condition). Primary hyperhidrosis is a chronic condition in which sweat production exceeds that needed for thermoregulation. It is thought to be related to excessive release of acetylcholine in the eccrine glands; size and number of eccrine glands is not different in patients with the condition compared to those without it. Both primary and secondary hyperhidrosis can severely affect an individual’s quality of life by leading to impairments in social interaction and decreased productivity in the workplace.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Mental and emotional health can be affected: low self-esteem and increased incidence of anxiety and depression have been reported.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]

There are 2 main types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. There may be a third type, called apoeccrine, but their existence is controversial.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a diagram illustrating the structure and components of eccrine and apocrine sweat glands in the skin.

### Components:

1. **Eccrine Sweat Gland (e):**
   - **Location:** Positioned deeper in the skin.
   - **Structure:** 
     - Contains a coiled tubular structure.
     - Composed of clear cells and dark cells.
     - Surrounded by myoepithelial cells.
   - **Function:** Primarily involved in thermoregulation through sweat secretion.

2. **Apocrine Sweat Gland (a):**
   - **Location:** Also located in the deeper layers of the skin but typically associated with hair follicles.
   - **Structure:**
     - Larger lumen compared to eccrine glands.
     - Contains secretory cells.
     - Surrounded by myoepithelial cells.
   - **Function:** Associated with scent release and becomes active during puberty.

3. **Duct (d):**
   - **Structure:** A channel that connects the gland to the skin surface.
   - **Components:** Lined with epithelial cells.
   - **Function:** Transports sweat from the gland to the skin surface.

### Visual Elements:

- **Skin Surface:** Represented by a thick black line at the top.
- **Hair Follicle:** Shown in association with the apocrine gland.
- **Arrows and Labels:** Indicate specific cell types and structures within the glands.

This diagram provides a comparative view of the two types of sweat glands, highlighting their structural differences and components.

Bromhidrosis (osmidrosis) is a chronic condition involving sweat that has an offensive odour. Body odour is generally produced by the action of bacterial degradation of apocrine sweat into ammonia and odoriferous, volatile short-chain fatty acids. Sweat from the eccrine glands is usually odourless, although occasionally excretion in sweat of certain chemicals from garlic, onions and fish can produce an odour, as can bacterial degradation of keratin secondary to maceration of the stratum corneum. Heritable metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease may cause bromhidrosis due to abnormal secretion of amino acids and their breakdown products in sweat. The odour produced from feet is often associated with footwear that does not allow air to circulate, causing excessive sweating and growth of bacteria.​[^[6]] Predisposing factors for bromhidrosis include hyperhidrosis, obesity and poor body hygiene.​[^[1]]​[^[7]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Concerns about body odour and underarm wetness resulting from normal, physiologic sweating can often be managed with self-treatment. Patients with excessive sweating that has not been controlled with regular use of antiperspirants, increased sweating of recent onset in adults, or sweating that occurs in an unusual pattern with no explanation should be assessed, in order to identify possible medical conditions or medications as the cause. See Pathophysiology.



Sweat production can be assessed with a simple colorimetric test that involves application of an indicator powder such as iodine with starch or quinizarin (a dye) to the area of concern. These powders change colour on exposure to sweat. For the starch-iodine test, an iodine solution is applied to dry, shaved skin in the area to be evaluated, and left to dry. A starch (potato or corn) is sprinkled over the area being tested; sweat will produce a dark blue discoloration. For quinizarin, the normally grey powder changes to a deep blue on exposure to sweat. Other methods used to assess sweat production include completion of standardized grading scales for specific areas (axillae, palms and/or soles), and gravimetric, evaporative or infrared thermography methods. Sweat production tests can be repeated after several weeks to identify areas of improvement and areas that need further treatment.​[^[21]] These methods are now used mostly in the research setting rather than in clinical dermatology practice.

An assessment plan for patients with perspiration-related complaints is presented in Figure 2.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Ensure investigation for, and/or treatment of, any underlying condition that may be causing secondary hyperhidrosis (e.g., systemic illness, medication) while implementing the nonpharmacologic measures discussed below, as appropriate. See Pathophysiology and Patient Assessment for more information.

#### General Measures

Wear clothing that is cool and porous and made from natural fibres that are more breathable than synthetics, particularly in the underarm area. Underarm shields primarily act as barriers and absorb sweat, preventing wetness from staining clothing. Wash clothing in hot water to remove body odour before wearing again. If possible, avoid spicy foods, alcohol, exercising in hot weather and stressful situations that may trigger strong emotions.​[^[6]]​[^[13]] Water and electrolytes lost through excessive sweating should be replaced regularly.

#### Personal Hygiene

To manage body odour, a regular bath or shower using soap and water will help to prevent buildup of bacteria, sweat and dead skin cells that interact to produce body odour. A daily bath or shower may be necessary for some people. When a full bath or shower is not possible, sponging in the underarm and genital areas can help control the major source of body odour. Shaving the armpits can reduce the propagation of body odour by reducing the surface area for bacterial action.​[^[6]] If underarm skin is irritated, avoid soap products that cause further irritation and use unscented cleansers instead.

#### Foot Care

Foot care is important for patients with excessive foot sweating (plantar hyperhidrosis) and/or odour. Feet should be washed regularly using a skin cleanser and dried thoroughly. Daily washing may be needed for odour control followed by application of an absorbent foot powder twice a day. Non-occlusive footwear made of natural materials, such as leather shoes (that do not have plastic linings), mesh-type running shoes or sandals, should be worn with socks made of cotton or fibres that are designed to wick away moisture. Alternating different pairs of shoes each day will allow them to dry thoroughly. Socks should be changed twice daily to ensure the feet remain dry and are not at risk of fungal infections (athlete’s foot).​[^[6]]​[^[22]] See Athlete's Foot.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Table 1 presents an approach to the management of hyperhidrosis, including pharmacologic therapies. Also see Table 3.

|  |
| --- |
| First Line |
| Topical agents | Aluminum chloride hexahydrate. See Antiperspirants section. |
| Glycopyrrolate is safe and effective when used topically for craniofacial​[23]​[24]​[25] and axillary hyperhidrosis.​[26] Topical pads impregnated with glycopyrrolate are commercially available (see Table 3). |
| Second Line​[b] |
| Botulinum toxin | Botulinum toxins block the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons in eccrine glands, which is beneficial in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. OnabotulinumtoxinA is approved for treatment of primary hyperhidrosis of the axillae and may reduce sweat production by 75–100%.​[13]​[18] Although not approved for use on other sites, it has been used clinically for hands, feet, face and groin.​[27]​[28] It is used as first-line treatment for moderate to severe primary hyperhidrosis of the axillae or for milder cases when topical treatment has failed after 1 month of continuous treatment. Sweat reduction should be noticed after 2–4 days and should be significant after 2 weeks.​[29] The procedure consists of a number of injections (average of 10–15 per axilla) and the effects last from 4–12 months, after which, treatment is repeated. It is expensive and may be painful (topical anesthetics, ice, dilution with lidocaine may help reduce the pain if needed).​[30] Research into administration via microneedles, resulting in less pain, is ongoing.​[6]​[14] Use of onabotulinumtoxinA is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding or in patients with neuromuscular disorders.Other botulinum toxins available in Canada (abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, prabotulinumtoxinA) are not approved for treatment of hyperhidrosis; some have been shown to have efficacy in small trials, but further studies are needed. |
| Iontophoresis | Iontophoresis is often used for hyperhidrosis of the hands and feet not responding to conservative therapy. It is considered safe and effective​[18]​[31] and is widely recommended.​[32]​[33]​[34] This process uses a water bath apparatus to introduce a mild electrical current of soluble ions into the skin; it is thought to work by blocking the sweat ducts at the skin surface or by inducing an electrical change in the sweat glands and disrupting secretion.​[6] The water used in the process must contain enough minerals and electrolytes to be effective; plain tap water is generally sufficient unless the water is too “soft,” in which case adding 1 tablespoon of baking soda to each tray of water is suggested. Anticholinergic medications such as glycopyrrolate added to the water may increase efficacy.​[35] Commercially available devices can be used at home. The process is time-consuming and not practical for some, depending on the area being treated.​[1] Initially, 3–4 treatments per week, each lasting approximately 30 minutes, may be needed. When adequate relief has been obtained, ongoing treatment is continued once per week to maintain the effect.​[14]​[18] Side effects are minor and consist of dry or cracked skin, tingling or burning, and, rarely, redness and small blisters. If any of these side effects occur, the voltage can be decreased. An emollient can be applied for dry skin, or a low-potency topical corticosteroid can be used to treat inflammation/redness.​[6] Iontophoresis is contraindicated in anyone who is pregnant, has a metallic implant or has a pacemaker.​[21] |
| Systemic therapy | Evidence has shown effectiveness of the oral anticholinergics glycopyrrolate and oxybutynin. They may be useful in patients with multifocal primary hyperhidrosis, compensatory hyperhidrosis (e.g., following ETS surgery), and in those for whom topical treatments, iontophoresis and onabotulinumtoxinA (or combinations of these) have not been satisfactory. These are not Health Canada–approved indications.​[18]​[36] Anticholinergic adverse effects are significant;​[37]​[38] they are not recommended in patients with glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, or urinary retention or in situations where patients are at risk of becoming overheated, as they may interfere with thermoregulation by limiting patients’ ability to sweat for cooling purposes. |
| Other oral agents that have been used based on limited evidence from case reports include clonazepam, clonidine, diltiazem, paroxetine and propranolol.​[18]​[36] |
| Destruction of sweat glands | Microwave energy is readily absorbed by tissues with a high water content and is used to destroy sweat glands via thermolysis. The miraDry device is used in some clinics in Canada but requires further studies to confirm efficacy and long-term safety. The procedure takes about 1 hour to complete and must be repeated after 3 months. Adverse effects may include swelling, discomfort, numbness and patchy alopecia.​[7]​[18] |
| Treatment with various laser techniques may be beneficial for some patients with axillary hyperhidrosis. Laser treatment can specifically target and destroy sweat glands. Evidence is limited to small studies, but it may be an option for some patients who have failed other treatments. Patients may experience some swelling, bruising or irritation in the treated area.​[18] |
| Limited studies have also assessed ultrasound technology and photodynamic therapy to produce thermal ablation of the sweat glands.​[7] |
| Limited evidence has suggested that destruction of the sweat glands via percutaneous injection of ethanol is safe and effective and may be a less invasive alternative to surgery in the treatment of bromhidrosis.​[39]​[40] |
| Third Line |
| Removal of sweat glands | Surgery is considered only when all other options for treatment have failed and permanent elimination of sweating is desired. One approach involves removal of the axillary sweat glands by excision, liposuction, curettage or laser. Removal of axillary glands is generally performed in a surgical setting under local anesthesia​[13]​[41] and is considered an emerging therapy, as the evidence base is limited.​[13] |
| Sympathectomy | A second method, endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS), is a major surgical procedure involving cutting nerves that signal sweat glands. It is mainly used to treat palmoplantar hyperhidrosis but it has also shown some success in treating axillary and craniofacial hyperhidrosis. In addition to the risk of surgical complications with ETS, a major disadvantage is that compensatory hyperhidrosis may be induced in other areas of the body (usually back, abdomen, thighs, chest), which can be worse than the original condition.​[6]​[13]​[21] |


#### Antiperspirants

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Antiperspirant and Deodorant Products.

First-line treatment in the management of perspiration and body odour problems in most cases is daily use of antiperspirants as part of a personal hygiene regimen (see Table 3).

**Antiperspirants** reduce sweating by mechanically obstructing the sweat gland ducts. Sweat production raises the pH in the gland, which causes precipitation of the aluminum salt in the antiperspirant, which then causes the sweat to thicken and clump and plug the duct. Once plugged, the sweat gland ducts receive a signal to reduce or stop perspiration, and this effect can last for 24 hours or longer.​[^[1]]​[^[6]] The effect wears off during the usual epidermal renewal process; however, long-term use of aluminum salts may lead to destruction of the eccrine glands, leading to decreased sweating over time.​[^[45]]​[^[46]] Antiperspirants are most commonly used for axillary sweating but can also be applied to any problematic body area (hands, feet, face, back, chest, groin). Irritation may be more common in more sensitive areas.​[^[47]] Skin irritation is the most common side effect and may be caused by the active ingredient (especially if applied to moist skin)​[^[30]] or by perfumes or preservatives used as additives.

Most standard commercial antiperspirant products contain partially neutralized **aluminum salts** (e.g., complexes with zirconium), which create superficial duct blockage that lasts for 24 hours or longer but does not cause irritation with once or twice daily use for most patients. If standard products are not effective, “clinical strength” products, most often containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate (possibly shortened to aluminum chloride on labels) may be tried (see Table 3). These products are more effective, as they create deeper and more effective duct blockages, but they are also more irritating, as aluminum chloride reacts with water or sweat to form hydrochloric acid, thereby requiring precise adherence to application instructions. Clinical effectiveness is noted after 1–2 weeks of correct application.



There is no evidence of any connection between use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants and Alzheimer disease (or any other dementias) or breast cancer.​[^[18]]​[^[30]]​[^[53]]

**Deodorants** do not prevent sweating but instead mask body odour with fragrance or by reducing the bacterial population in the area. Deodorants may contain nonantiperspirant **aluminum**- or **zinc**-containing compounds which have antibacterial action. Others contain mixtures of fragrant herbs and botanicals. Most aluminum-free products are strictly deodorants, though some contain substances that manufacturers claim block wetness by absorbing sweat or decreasing sweat production or secretion. There is no evidence of effectiveness for these products. **Alum** has been used traditionally as a water purifier; “natural” or “crystal” deodorants usually contain **potassium alum** or ammonium alum crystals, which are sulfates of aluminium and are therefore not “aluminum-free.” Other products that have been used as deodorants are vinegar, sodium bicarbonate and isopropyl alcohol.​[^[6]]

Products used to control foot odour contain combinations of zinc oxide, sodium bicarbonate, **corn starch**, **aluminum** and **alcohol**. 

Astringents like formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methenamine and tannic acid were once used to treat hyperhidrosis by plugging the pores. These chemicals are no longer used because of contact sensitivity and white-brown skin discoloration.​[^[6]]​[^[45]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 2 provides a monitoring plan framework, which should be individualized.

| Symptom | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Underarm wetness | Monitor daily for 2–3 wk while using antiperspirants (try standard followed by aluminum chloride hexahydrate products, if needed) as well as a daily personal hygiene routine. | Dry axillae in resting, non-stressed state at comfortable room temperature after 2–3 wk of intervention. | If aluminum chloride hexahydrate products are effective, reduce frequency to level required to maintain effect.If patient cannot tolerate aluminum chloride hexahydrate products (mild or stronger strengths) or is not responding after a 2- to 3-wk treatment trial, other treatment options should be considered. |
| Hand sweating | Monitor daily while using antiperspirants (try standard followed by aluminum chloride hexahydrate, if needed) applied to the palms of the hands for 1–3 wk. | Hand sweating reduced to a tolerable level after 4 wk of intervention. | If hand sweating interferes with social or occupational activities, refer to a physician.If patient cannot tolerate aluminum chloride hexahydrate or is not responding after a 3-wk trial, other treatment options should be considered. |
| Foot sweating | Monitor daily while using a regular foot-care routine including nonpharmacologic therapy as indicated previously.Monitor daily for 1–3 wk while using antiperspirants and/or absorbent foot powders. | Foot sweating reduced to a tolerable level after 3 wk of treatment. | If patient cannot tolerate products containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate or is not responding to treatment after a 3-wk trial, other treatment options should be considered. |
| Body odour | Monitor daily while using a personal hygiene routine that includes washing with soap and water, changing clothing as required and regular use of antiperspirants. | Offensive body odour eliminated after 1–2 wk of intervention. | If personal hygiene measures and antiperspirants are ineffective after 1–2 wk, other treatment options should be considered. |
| Skin irritation from antiperspirants | Monitor daily for skin irritation (redness, pain, burning, itch) in the area of application. | Antiperspirant tolerated with minimal or no irritation. | Ensure correct use (to completely dry skin) and, if irritation continues, use a different brand, lower concentration aluminum product, product with a salicylic acid gel base or a deodorant.Treat symptomatically with low-potency topical corticosteroid cream twice daily for no more than 14 days if irritation severe.If irritation continues, stop antiperspirant and consider other treatment options. |
| Side effects of anticholinergic drugs | Monitor daily for dry mouth, urinary hesitancy, mydriasis and photophobia. | Side effects tolerable. | Discontinue use in consultation with health-care practitioner if side effects affect quality of life. |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for assessing and managing sweating issues, distinguishing between normal physiological sweating and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).

### Initial Assessment:
- **Assess patient symptoms and history:**
  - Duration of symptoms
  - Location on body
  - Medical conditions and current medications
  - Treatments used previously

### Decision Point:
- **Is sweating excessive?**
  - **No:**
    - Normal physiological sweating in response to normal stimuli (emotional, thermal, exercise)
    - Affects feet, underarm, forehead, or hands
    - Bothersome but tolerable

    **Management:**
    - Consider self-care treatment:
      - Use nonpharmacologic methods (breathable natural fiber clothing, underarm shields)
      - Avoid triggers (spicy foods, alcohol, exercise in hot environments, stress)
      - Apply antiperspirants daily
      - Monitor for 2–3 weeks
    - If little to no improvement, increase strength of aluminum in antiperspirant and continue with nonpharmacologic methods

  - **Yes:**
    - Sweating is excessive and affects quality of life
    - Not controlled by standard or clinical strength antiperspirants

    **Further Classification:**
    - **Primary Hyperhidrosis:**
      - Affects palms, axillae, plantar surfaces, neck, craniofacial region
      - Cause unknown
      - Treat with aluminum chloride hexahydrate
      - Use nonpharmacologic methods
      - If no improvement in 3–4 weeks, consider adding or switching to:
        - Topical glycopyrrolate
        - Botulinum toxin A injections
      - If no improvement, consider other pharmacologic therapies (e.g., oral anticholinergics) or medical procedures

    - **Secondary Hyperhidrosis:**
      - Can be localized or generalized
      - Typically associated with an underlying medical condition or medication
      - Treat medical condition causing hyperhidrosis and/or consider medication change if possible

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing different types of sweating issues, with specific recommendations for treatment based on the severity and underlying causes.

| **oxybutynin** (generics) | 1.25–10 mg daily in 1–3 divided doses PO | Dry mouth (most common), mydriasis, constipation, nausea, dizziness, urinary retention. | Caution with concomitant use of other anticholinergics (increased risk of adverse effects); oxybutynin effects increased by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. | Generally reserved for use in recalcitrant cases or in multifocal hyperhidrosis or compensatory hyperhidrosis.Not a Health Canada–approved indication. |
| **aluminum salts, various (e.g., aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine, aluminum chlorohydrate) in solid, spray formats** (Arrid, Speed Stick, others) | Apply to completely dry skin on affected area daily to BID (if once daily, HS preferred) | Local irritation. | Not applicable. | Avoid application on freshly shaved or abraded skin if irritation is a concern. |
| **aluminum chloride hexahydrate** (Drysol, Perspirex, others) | 6.25–20%: apply to completely dry skin on affected area at HS × 3 days or until desired effect reached and then taper to 2–3 times weekly to maintain effect. Choose weaker strengths for sensitive areas such as forehead and stronger strengths for palms and soles | Local irritation. Correct application and starting with weaker strengths can minimize irritation. | Not applicable. | A cool blow dryer may be used to completely dry the skin prior to application.Some sources recommend trying occlusion (with plastic wrap) if correct application of aluminum chloride hexahydrate products is not effective and did not cause irritation.​[52]Products with a salicylic acid gel base may be less irritating. |
| **acetyl hexapeptide-3** (Klima Hyper-Dri Antiperspirant Serum, Native) | As per manufacturer recommendations for specific product | As for all topical products, risk of local irritation. | Not applicable. | No evidence of effectiveness as antiperspirants.
