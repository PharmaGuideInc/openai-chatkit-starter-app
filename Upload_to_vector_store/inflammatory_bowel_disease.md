#### Introduction

The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) consist of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD may involve any part of the GI tract while UC is restricted to the colon, with a variable extent of involvement. UC that involves the entire colon is termed ulcerative pancolitis, UC of the rectum and sigmoid colon is ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, and UC limited to the rectum is ulcerative proctitis.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Refer all patients to specialist care for confirmation of diagnosis, initial treatment and management of exacerbations.



#### Therapeutic Choices

Therapy is determined by the site and extent of disease, by the severity of symptoms, and by the presence of factors that suggest a poorer prognosis (including, but not limited to, young age of onset, perianal disease and extensive small bowel involvement). Patients with mild to moderate disease activity are managed as outpatients, whereas those with severe symptoms may require hospitalization. Therapy is sequential in first inducing and then maintaining remission.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic management of IBD includes the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic response modifiers, antibiotics, antidiarrheals and, to a limited degree, opioid analgesics (see Table 1). In selecting therapy, consider efficacy, route of administration and potential adverse events.

#### Aminosalicylates

5-aminosalicylic acid** (5-ASA)** includes both mesalamine (2 linked 5-ASA moieties) and sulfasalazine (a sulfapyridine linked to a 5-ASA moiety with an azo bond). The term 5-ASA generally refers to mesalamine with sulfasalazine being differentiated and referred to directly by name. 5-ASA may be administered orally or rectally. Oral preparations are formulated to release 5-ASA at specific sites in the GI tract since efficacy is dependent on luminal concentration. **Salofalk** and **Pentasa** release 5-ASA in the small bowel, allowing it to be available in the small bowel and colon. Sulfasalazine, olsalazine, **Asacol** and **Mezavant** release 5-ASA primarily in the colon.

All oral 5-ASA compounds, irrespective of their formulation, are equally effective and safe for induction of remission and prevention of relapse of mild to moderate UC.​[^[2]] 5-ASA is ineffective for induction or maintenance of pharmacologically or surgically induced remission of CD while sulfasalazine may have a modest benefit for induction of remission in mild colonic CD.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Sulfasalazine has the least favourable adverse effect profile, which includes nausea, headache, rash, hemolytic anemia, hepatotoxicity and reports of reversible oligospermia. However, many of these effects are minor and dose-related, and the majority of these events (>90%) are related to the sulfapyridine moiety, which is not present in the 5-ASA preparations. In addition, the structure of sulfapyridine is similar to that of sulfamethoxazole and may trigger a cross-reaction in patients with a history of allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics.​[^[5]] Adverse reactions to 5-ASA therapies include hypersensitivity reactions and, infrequently, renal toxicity in the form of interstitial nephritis.

#### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission in patients with CD and UC.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Patients with moderately severe exacerbations of CD or UC are treated initially with oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day.​[^[8]] In those with more severe disease, hospitalization and treatment with IV corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone) may be necessary. Patients who respond to IV therapy are switched to oral prednisone once stabilized. Taper the prednisone dose as improvement occurs (see Table 1).​[^[8]]​[^[9]] Oral budesonide is effective for induction of remission of mild to moderate ileocecal CD​[^[10]] but to a relatively lesser extent than conventional corticosteroids.​[^[11]] Budesonide enemas are effective for the treatment of left-sided UC and have a low incidence of side effects.​[^[12]] Oral budesonide multi-matrix formulation (MMX) is designed for colonic delivery and is an effective option for induction in patients with mild to moderate UC.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Budesonide is rapidly inactivated in the liver, resulting in lower systemic bioavailability and lower adrenal suppression compared with conventional corticosteroids.​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

Avoid long-term use of corticosteroids and reserve use for patients unresponsive to other drugs. Oral corticosteroids are not recommended for maintenance of remission of IBD.​[^[6]]​[^[11]] Patients requiring multiple courses of corticosteroids over a short duration of time (e.g., 1–2 y) should have their maintenance therapy addressed and optimized. Inform patients of the possible side effects and obtain informed consent. Osteoporosis is a concern with long-term therapy. To maintain bone health, supplemental calcium and vitamin D, smoking cessation and exercise are useful interventions; bisphosphonates are helpful in select individuals.​[^[16]] Use of corticosteroids is also associated with avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

#### Immunomodulators

The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine** (6-MP)** are used in patients with refractory IBD to maintain a pharmacologically induced remission and decrease the need for corticosteroids,​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] but they are ineffective as monotherapy in inducing remission of active IBD.​[^[19]] Weekly intramuscular injections of methotrexate can induce and maintain remission in patients with CD,​[^[19]] but it has not been demonstrated to be effective for inducing or maintaining remission in patients with UC.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] As the onset of action of these agents is slow (e.g., 1–3 months), the usual recommendation is to start treatment with immunomodulators at the same time as corticosteroids to induce remission, then wean corticosteroids and use immunomodulators to maintain corticosteroid-free remission.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]​[^[24]] Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is used for induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.​[^[25]] It is used for patients refractory to conventional therapy and has a reasonably quick onset of action.​[^[26]]

All immune-modulating drugs have significant side effects (e.g., bone marrow suppression, cytopenias, infections), and hematologic parameters should be monitored during therapy. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype testing could be considered prior to initiation of azathioprine or 6-MP to identify patients with functional mutations who are at increased risk of the myelosuppressive effects of thiopurines. IBD therapy with thiopurines is also associated with a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders (typically as a result of B-cell clonal proliferation), and this risk is dependent on the patient’s age, disease duration and duration of thiopurine treatment.​[^[27]] As a result, the benefits of thiopurines in the management of IBD have to be considered relative to the risks, particularly in pediatric or geriatric patients who may be more vulnerable to complications.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] Pancreatitis occurs in approximately 3% of patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP, usually occurring within 1 month of initiation of therapy.​[^[29]] Although the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer is an uncommon complication of treatment with thiopurines, ongoing and past exposure to these medications significantly increases the risk in all patients with IBD.​[^[30]]​[^[31]] Patients with current or prior treatment with azathioprine or 6-MP should have yearly skin checks and be counselled on measures to reduce UV exposure, such as use of sun block and wearing sun-protective clothing.​[^[31]] No strong evidence exists to support a similar relationship with methotrexate. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and hepatotoxicity are the most important adverse effects of methotrexate. Coadministration of folic acid (1 mg daily) is recommended with methotrexate to minimize adverse effects.

Tofacitinib also requires monitoring of hematologic parameters due to concern for anemia, lymphopenia or neutropenia. Further, lipid profile should be monitored as a small subset of patients will experience elevation in LDL without corresponding elevations in HDL.​[^[32]] Although the long-term ramifications of these lipid abnormalities is unclear, treatment with statin therapies is sometimes used. Patients treated with tofacitinib are at higher risk of shingles, and vaccination with herpes zoster vaccine should be considered to lower risk while on therapy. Health Canada has issued a safety alert advising that all JAK inhibitors increase risk of malignancies, thrombosis or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).​[^[33]] The increased cardiovascular risk was observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥65 years of age, had at least one cardiovascular risk factor and were taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID for prolonged periods,​[^[34]] which may not reflect the risk for most patients with UC.​[^[35]] Caution is recommended when using tofacitinib in geriatric patients, patients who are current or past smokers, patients with cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors, or patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

#### Biologic Response Modifiers

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) antibodies are useful in the management of moderate to severe IBD, including in those patients with evidence of fistulizing disease. Anti-TNF-alpha agents include adalimumab, certolizumab **pegol**, golimumab and infliximab. While available for use in other inflammatory conditions, certolizumab pegol is not approved in Canada for the treatment of CD. Infliximab is administered IV; adalimumab and golimumab are administered SC and are effective in patients with IBD who experienced treatment failure with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or infliximab. Any of these drugs is a potential first-line choice depending on cost, safety, route of administration and patient’s preference.​[^[36]]​[^[37]]​[^[38]]

Usually, induction doses of all anti-TNF-alpha agents are given on weeks 0 and 2 with an additional dose at week 6 for infliximab. Maintenance doses are usually given every 2 weeks for adalimumab, 4 weeks for golimumab and 8 weeks for infliximab. Approximately one-third of UC or CD patients will not initially respond to the anti-TNF-alpha medications, and a significant proportion of responders experience a secondary loss of response during therapy. To address therapy failure or persistent inflammation, doses and dosing frequencies may be increased or the anti-TNF-alpha agent may be replaced with another agent from the same or different class.

Infections, formation of antinuclear antibodies, a rare lupus-like syndrome, lymphoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, cervical dysplasia and worsening of heart failure are important concerns associated with anti-TNF-alpha therapies. Opportunistic infections and tuberculosis have occurred during anti-TNF-alpha treatment.​[^[39]] Screen for tuberculosis prior to treatment by obtaining a history of exposure, taking a chest x-ray and performing tuberculin skin testing. Manage patients who have evidence of latent tuberculosis in collaboration with an infectious disease specialist.

Anti-integrin therapies are also effective for management of IBD. Natalizumab is an anti-alpha4-integrin antibody that is an effective therapy for CD.​[^[40]] Binding to alpha4-integrin interferes with lymphocyte infiltration into intestinal mucosa and leads to improvements in intestinal inflammation. However, this mechanism of action is not specific to the GI tract, and initial success with natalizumab was quickly mitigated by several reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This resulted in a large decline in use, but this drug provided proof-of-concept that targeting this pathway can suppress gut inflammation.

Vedolizumab is a second-generation anti-integrin therapy approved in Canada for CD and UC. It is an IV-administered anti-alpha4beta7 integrin antibody that does not seem to have the same risk of PML as natalizumab.​[^[41]] By binding to the alpha4beta7 integrin on pathogenic lymphocytes, vedolizumab prevents these cells from interacting with the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) receptor. As a result, the lymphocytes are unable to cross the endothelium into the GI tissue and inflammation is reduced. Since MAdCAM-1 is expressed primarily on gut endothelial cells and alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the GI tract, vedolizumab theoretically offers gut-selective immunosuppression without apparent risk of systemic infections or malignancy. Induction doses are administered at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and maintenance doses are every 8 weeks. Common adverse events include nasopharyngitis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infections, which may be related to the presence of MAdCAM-1 in the upper respiratory tract.

Ustekinumab is an interleukin (IL) antagonist that binds to the common p40 protein subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 to prevent activation of inflammatory and immune responses. Ustekinumab has been approved in Canada for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD who did not tolerate or had an inadequate response to treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or anti-TNF-alpha therapies after proving superior to placebo for both induction and subsequent maintenance of remission in this patient population.​[^[42]] Induction doses consist of a single IV infusion (over at least 1 hour) and maintenance doses are administered SC every 8 weeks thereafter. Common adverse events include headache, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections, and injection site reactions (including swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage and hematoma).

#### Antibiotics

Short courses (2–4 wk) of metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin are useful for the treatment of patients with CD and perianal fistulae or isolated colonic CD.​[^[43]] Metronidazole may cause a disulfiram-like reaction in some patients if alcohol is ingested, and neuropathy may occur with long-term use.

#### Antidiarrheals

Use antidiarrheals with caution and avoid in severe disease because of the risk of toxic megacolon. Diphenoxylate/​atropine is a combination of an opiate and an anticholinergic drug, which can cause CNS side effects. Loperamide acts on both cholinergic and opiate receptors, but has a lower incidence of adverse effects than diphenoxylate.

#### Opiate Analgesics

Opiates decrease GI motility. Chronic use may lead to narcotic bowel syndrome (chronic or frequently recurring abdominal pain that worsens with continued or escalating dosages of narcotics), increased risk of habituation and, in some individuals, worsened IBD symptoms.

Codeine is useful for pain control and decreasing the number of bowel movements. However, up to 10% of patients may not respond to the drug due to a genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in inefficient conversion of codeine to morphine. Avoid use of morphine or meperidine or restrict to short-term treatment in select patients, if necessary.

#### Immunization

IBD has been associated with a higher rate of infections, many of which may be preventable with appropriate vaccination.​[^[44]] Determining the immunization status of patients prior to receiving immunomodulators or biologic agents is an important part of initial management. While on immunosuppressive treatment, patients have an increased risk of opportunistic infections, a blunted response to immunization and a risk of infection with live-attenuated vaccines.

During initial assessment, obtain a history of past chicken pox infection as well as serologies for varicella zoster virus (VZV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In those patients who are VZV negative, vaccination is recommended followed by a minimum of 3 weeks’ wait prior to starting an immunomodulator or anti-TNF-alpha agent. Immunization against HBV is recommended in patients who are HBV-negative.​[^[45]] In patients who are HBV-positive, antiviral therapy should start at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of immunomodulators or anti-TNF-alpha agents.

Annual vaccination using inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended, as is immunization against pneumococcus. Adults ≥18 years receiving immunocompromising therapy who have not previously received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneu-P-23) should receive 1 dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pneu-C-13) followed at least 8 weeks later by Pneu-P-23, with a single booster of Pneu-P-23 at least 5 years after the first dose. If the patient has already received Pneu-P-23, the Pneu-C-13 dose should not be administered for at least 1 year.​[^[47]] In females 9–45 years of age and males 9–26 years of age, vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended if not previously received.

Live vaccines available in Canada that are contraindicated in immunosuppressed IBD patients include intranasal influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), smallpox, oral typhoid, yellow fever and varicella.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] Live vaccines should not be given to patients using immunosuppressive therapy until 3 months after these therapies are stopped.

Ideally, patients >50 years of age who are candidates for immunosuppressive therapy should be immunized against herpes zoster prior to initiating treatment. Live herpes zoster vaccine is not used to elicit a primary immune response; therefore, it may be considered safe to administer to patients receiving low-dose immunosuppressive therapy; an immunodeficiency expert opinion should be obtained when considering live herpes zoster vaccine in patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha agents. Alternatively, non-live, recombinant herpes zoster vaccine can be administered to patients while on biologics or immunomodulator therapies, although it is unclear if the vaccine would be as efficacious while on these therapies.​[^[47]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

IBD in pregnant patients increases the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight and miscarriages;​[^[48]] however, the evidence is not as strong for an increased risk of congenital abnormalities.​[^[48]] Pregnant IBD patients in remission at the time of conception are likely to remain in remission during pregnancy, but up to one-third may relapse during the pregnancy.​[^[49]]​[^[50]] Advise patients with IBD who are planning a pregnancy to try conceiving at a time when the disease is in remission.​[^[51]] Advise all IBD patients that their disease does not reduce fertility; the observed childlessness in IBD patients is due to voluntary choices often based on incorrect patient beliefs rather than physiologic or organic causes.​[^[52]] Most IBD medications, except methotrexate, should not be discontinued at conception or while breastfeeding since their cessation might lead to disease flare; the risk of the untreated disease (preterm birth, miscarriage) is often greater than the risk of most available medications.​[^[48]]

Aminosalicylates are considered low risk for use in pregnancy or while breastfeeding.​[^[53]] Due to potential antifolate effects, patients taking sulfasalazine may be safely switched to** 5-ASA** or are generally advised to supplement with 2 mg of folic acid daily starting before conception and continuing throughout their pregnancy.​[^[48]]

Corticosteroids are considered safe and may be continued in pregnancy if indicated; however, use them with caution in the first trimester since they have been associated with an increased, though still low, risk of oral clefts in the newborn.​[^[54]] Corticosteroids may be used at any stage of pregnancy (including first trimester) if benefits outweigh potential risks, e.g., during disease flares. Prednisone and prednisolone are considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[48]]

Cyclosporine is not usually used for treatment of IBD but is considered to have an overall low risk during pregnancy. Do not use cyclosporine during breastfeeding; anti-TNF-alpha agents are safer in this situation.​[^[55]]

Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine** (6-MP)** are considered low risk during pregnancy despite the conflicting safety data.​[^[48]] Azathioprine and 6-MP are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding but it is considered safest to separate breastfeeding by a few hours from dosing.​[^[56]]

Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding owing to its teratogenic and cytotoxic effects.​[^[48]] Recommend effective contraception if patient is receiving methotrexate. Discontinue the drug 3–6 months prior to attempted conception.

Tofacitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to teratogenicity; patients using tofacitinib should be advised to use effective contraception. Tofacitinib should be discontinued 4–6 weeks prior to attempting conception.​[^[32]]

Use of adalimumab, golimumab and infliximab in pregnant patients with IBD is considered low risk during the first and second trimesters; however, there are concerns about immunosuppression in the newborn if administered during the third trimester.​[^[57]]​[^[58]] In patients with active disease and those at high risk of relapse of active IBD, the risks of uncontrolled disease activity (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight and miscarriage) may outweigh the potential toxicity of anti-TNF-alpha medications, e.g., serious systemic infections.​[^[59]]​[^[60]] Therefore, expert consensus statements recommend these therapies be continued during the third trimester, particularly in those with a history of difficult to control disease, but consideration can be made for discontinuing anti-TNF-alpha agents around the start of the third trimester if the patient is in long-term remission.​[^[61]]

Adalimumab, golimumab and infliximab are actively transported across the placenta in the third trimester and may remain in the newborn’s blood for up to 6 months postdelivery. Therefore, unless serum anti-TNF-alpha levels in the newborn are proven negative, administration of any live vaccines (e.g., rotavirus vaccine) should be delayed until at least 6 months of age.​[^[61]]​[^[62]] Use of anti-TNF-alpha therapies is compatible with breastfeeding, as levels detected in breast milk are minimal to none.​[^[63]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]]

The safety of using ustekinumab or vedolizumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is currently unknown.

Metronidazole has a low teratogenic risk when used during pregnancy, but should not be used while patient is breastfeeding because it transfers to breast milk.​[^[48]] Avoid prolonged metronidazole use in pregnant patients.

Alternatives to ciprofloxacin should be considered for pregnant and breastfeeding patients.​[^[48]]​[^[66]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Crohn Disease

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Encourage smoking cessation, since smoking may worsen CD.​[^[67]]

Advise patients not to arbitrarily limit food groups. The goal is to ensure an adequate caloric intake. Nutritional supplements or parenteral nutrition may be necessary in select patients who are malnourished.

Exclusive enteral nutrition delivered by tube feeding or oral delivery is the best studied dietary intervention for CD and an effective therapy for induction and maintenance of remission.​[^[68]] Although it has beneficial effects in adults and children, its adherence in adults is low due to poor tolerability of nasogastric tubes and palatability of the formulations. However, it is often used first-line among pediatric patients with CD to avoid corticosteroid-related side effects, particularly impairment of growth. Evidence is emerging for dietary modification in combination with enteral nutrition (CD exclusion diet), but dietary exclusion on its own has not yet been shown to be an effective way to treat CD.​[^[69]]

Surgery may be necessary to treat strictures, abscesses and fistulae, or to treat patients refractory to medical management. Recurrence after surgery is almost universal, so conservative surgical management with resection of a minimum amount of bowel is favoured. Consideration to which postoperative medical therapies should be given depend on patient risk factors for recurrence. Since the introduction of the anti-TNF-alpha agents, surgery as a management option for CD has declined.​[^[70]] However, preoperative use of anti-TNF-alpha drugs may increase the occurrence of postoperative complications (particularly infections) in CD patients.​[^[71]]​[^[72]]

Limited evidence indicates that psychological therapy may be beneficial in adolescent IBD patients and shows most promise in reducing pain, fatigue, relapse rate and hospitalization, as well as improving adherence to medication.​[^[73]]​[^[74]] However, there is no evidence to support psychological therapy in adult IBD patients.​[^[74]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

See the previous general discussion of pharmacologic choices in IBD. Figure 1 outlines the pharmacologic management of CD and Table 1 lists the drugs used in the treatment of IBD.

**5-ASA** is ineffective for maintenance of pharmacologically or surgically induced remission of CD, while sulfasalazine may have a modest benefit for induction of remission in mild colonic CD.​[^[3]]​[^[8]]​[^[75]]

Corticosteroids are effective for the induction of remission (70% response rate). Prednisone (40–60 mg/day for 12–16 wk) is the most commonly used corticosteroid.​[^[8]] The efficacy of budesonide is lower than that achieved with conventional corticosteroids, but it is associated with lower likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression and is the preferred therapy in patients with disease limited to the ileum and right colon.​[^[10]] Chronic therapy with conventional corticosteroids or budesonide is ineffective for the maintenance of remission in CD.​[^[76]]​[^[77]] Furthermore, long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with significant adverse events and adrenal suppression.​[^[76]]​[^[77]]

Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine** (6-MP)** are ineffective as monotherapy for induction of remission in active Crohn disease but are effective in maintaining remission.​[^[18]]​[^[78]] In patients who experience nausea with azathioprine, a trial of 6-MP may be safely attempted before abandoning this class of medications.​[^[79]]

Intramuscular injections of methotrexate are safe and effective for inducing remission of CD at doses of 25 mg/week, with doses of 15/mg week for maintenance of remission.​[^[23]]​[^[80]]​[^[81]] Although the evidence supports administering methotrexate IM, it is often prescribed SC in Canada to facilitate patient convenience.

Infliximab​[^[82]] and adalimumab​[^[83]]​[^[84]]​[^[85]] are effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe CD and in inducing closure of perianal fistulae.​[^[86]]​[^[87]] Combining infliximab with azathioprine is more effective than infliximab monotherapy,​[^[18]]​[^[88]] suggesting that initial dual therapy may be preferable for high-risk patients, particularly those who are naïve to prior treatment with biologics and immunomodulators. It is unclear whether these findings can be extrapolated to the other biologic agents or to those with prior exposure to immunomodulator therapies.​[^[89]]

Vedolizumab is effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe CD, including patients who failed prior TNF-alpha antagonist therapies.​[^[41]]​[^[90]] The efficacy of vedolizumab for treatment of perianal fistulae or extraintestinal manifestations of CD is uncertain. The benefit of combination therapy of vedolizumab with immunomodulators also remains unclear. The time-to-effectiveness for vedolizumab is variable, with the most rapid onset as early as 2 weeks in TNF-alpha antagonist-naïve patients and as late as 10 weeks in TNF-alpha antagonist-experienced patients.​[^[91]]

Ustekinumab is effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe CD who failed prior therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators or TNF-alpha inhibitors. Compared with placebo, ustekinumab demonstrated a significantly higher rate of clinical response at 6 weeks and remission at 44 weeks.​[^[42]]

There are no prospective head-to-head trials comparing biologic therapies in CD.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Ulcerative Colitis

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Advise patients not to arbitrarily limit food groups. Watch for dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities, especially during disease flares.

Surgery (colectomy) may be used to treat patients who are refractory to medical therapy or who have precancerous or cancerous changes in the colon. Since the introduction of the anti-TNF-alpha agents, however, surgery as a management option for UC has declined.​[^[70]]

Although colectomy “cures” UC, pouchitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that occurs after ileoanal reservoir construction, can be troublesome.​[^[93]] Symptoms of pouchitis include tenesmus (feeling of constantly needing to pass stools despite an empty colon), diarrhea and bleeding.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

See the previous general discussion of pharmacologic choices in IBD. Figure 2 outlines the management of UC and Table 1 lists the drugs used in the treatment of IBD.

Sulfasalazine and **5-ASA** are effective in inducing remission and mucosal healing in patients with mild to moderate UC and in maintaining remission of quiescent disease.​[^[94]]​[^[95]]​[^[96]]

Sulfasalazine may be marginally superior to 5-ASA for maintaining remission but not for inducing remission.​[^[94]]​[^[95]]

Once-daily dosing of 5-ASA is as effective and safe as conventional divided dosing for the induction and maintenance of remission in mild-moderate UC.​[^[97]]​[^[98]]

Oral doses of 5-ASA in excess of 2 g/day are associated with a higher likelihood of successful remission of mild-moderate UC.​[^[99]]​[^[100]]

Combination of oral and rectal 5-ASA therapy is more effective than oral or rectal monotherapy for mild-moderate active UC.​[^[101]]​[^[102]]

Oral corticosteroids are also effective in inducing remission. Use the lowest possible dose of prednisone to control disease activity.

Patients with mild-moderate UC, including those who are failing 5-ASA therapies, can be treated with budesonide** MMX** for 8 weeks to induce clinical remission.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Patients with response to budesonide MMX can start or continue 5-ASA therapies for maintenance once in remission.

Hospitalized patients with severe UC are at risk of life-threatening complications and should receive parenteral corticosteroids when admitted to hospital.

If parenteral corticosteroids fail in inducing response after 72 hours of use in hospital, escalation to second-line rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine is recommended.​[^[103]] Colectomy could also be considered in place of medical rescue therapy. Surgery is indicated when infliximab or cyclosporine fail or when complications arise.​[^[103]] IV cyclosporine may be effective in up to 80% of patients with severe UC refractory to corticosteroids, but it is associated with a 1-year mortality rate of 1%.​[^[104]] IV cyclosporine use has generally declined in favour of anti-TNF-alpha treatment.

The purine antimetabolites azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are effective for maintenance of remission in UC and are useful steroid-sparing agents in patients who require repeated courses of corticosteroids.​[^[105]]

There is no evidence to support the use of methotrexate for induction or maintenance of remission in patients with UC.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]

The anti-TNF-alpha agents adalimumab, golimumab and infliximab are equally effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with UC, including those refractory to conventional medical therapy.​[^[106]]​[^[107]] Adalimumab is also effective in patients with intolerance or loss of response to previous anti-TNF-alpha therapy, such as infliximab.​[^[107]]​[^[108]] These agents can provide meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life for patients with UC.​[^[109]]

The anti-integrin agent vedolizumab is effective at induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC, including patients with prior anti-TNF-alpha therapy failure.​[^[110]]

Ustekinumab is effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe UC who failed prior therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti-TNF-alpha agents or vedolizumab. Compared with placebo, ustekinumab demonstrated a significantly higher rate of clinical response at 6 weeks and remission at 44 weeks.​[^[111]]

Tofacitinib has demonstrated efficacy at induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to severe UC who failed on corticosteroids, immunomodulators or anti-TNF-alpha therapies.​[^[25]]

One prospective head-to-head trial was published comparing vedolizumab to adalimumab for moderate to severe UC (VARSITY study). This study demonstrated that vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab at one year for clinical remission and endoscopic improvements.​[^[112]]

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

See the previous general discussion of pharmacologic choices in IBD. Figure 3 outlines the management of ulcerative proctosigmoiditis and Table 1 lists the drugs used in the treatment of IBD.

Given the limited extent of the inflammation (rectum/sigmoid colon), the initial focus is on rectally administered therapy.​[^[101]] **5-ASA** preparations (suppositories, enemas) administered at bedtime are the initial treatment of choice. Alternatively, rectal corticosteroids can be used. If a response is not achieved with one of these strategies, switching to the other is advised. Suppositories are effective only for proctitis, whereas enemas can be used to treat disease in the descending colon and rectum, from the splenic flexure distally.

If remission is not induced within 2–4 weeks, oral 5-ASA should be added. Limited data suggest that there is an additive benefit of initiating combined oral and rectal 5-ASA induction therapy.​[^[102]] Rectal 5-ASA monotherapy may be effective for maintenance of remission of mild to moderate distal disease.​[^[101]]​[^[102]] Switch patients who are unresponsive to these measures to budesonide **MMX**, prednisone or (rarely) IV corticosteroids. Discontinue all medications if patients are brought into remission easily after a first episode (within 4–8 wk). Follow-up is essential; place patients on chronic maintenance therapy with 5-ASA if symptoms recur. Most patients prefer oral maintenance therapy, although in practice many will require prolonged rectal 5-ASA therapy.

Patients brought into remission with difficulty should continue on long-term oral or rectal 5-ASA preparations without attempting to discontinue therapy.

Patients rarely require chronic treatment with low-dose prednisone or purine antimetabolites. Biologics are often not needed, but are effective in inducing and maintaining a clinical response in refractory ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.​[^[116]] Colectomy may be necessary in some patients despite the limited extent of the disease.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart for managing a disease based on its site and activity level. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - **Establish Site:** Determine if the disease is in the small bowel, colon, or both.
   - **Assess Disease Activity:** Classify the disease as Mild, Moderate, or Severe.

2. **Mild Disease:**
   - **Colonic Disease:**
     - Induce remission with sulfasalazine for 4–6 weeks.
   - **Ileal Disease:**
     - Induce remission with oral budesonide for 8–16 weeks.
   - **Remission Check:**
     - If Yes: Discontinue therapy or consider maintenance with AZA, 6-MP, or MTX.
     - If No: Use oral corticosteroids and refer to the Moderate category.

3. **Moderate Disease:**
   - Induce remission with prednisone (10–16 weeks) or oral budesonide (for ileal/right-sided colonic disease only) for 8–16 weeks.
   - **Remission Check:**
     - If Yes: Start maintenance therapy with AZA, 6-MP, or MTX and taper off corticosteroids.
     - If No: Use IV corticosteroids for 3–10 days; refer to Severe category. Consider early biologic therapy with AZA, 6-MP, or MTX in select cases.

4. **Severe Disease:**
   - Induce remission with oral prednisone (tapering to 0 over 12–16 weeks; see Table 1) or biologic therapy with or without AZA, 6-MP, or MTX.
   - **Remission Check:**
     - If remission induced with prednisone: Start maintenance therapy with AZA, 6-MP, or MTX.
     - If remission induced with biologic therapy with or without AZA, 6-MP, or MTX: Continue current therapy as maintenance.
     - If No remission: Consider optimization or change of therapy; consider surgery in select cases.

**Key Terms:**
- **AZA:** Azathioprine
- **6-MP:** 6-Mercaptopurine
- **MTX:** Methotrexate

This flowchart guides the treatment approach based on disease severity and location, with specific recommendations for inducing remission and maintaining it.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of ulcerative colitis, detailing treatment pathways for mild to moderate and severe disease.

### Mild to Moderate Disease

1. **Initial Treatment:**
   - High-dose oral 5-ASA and topical 5-ASA.

2. **Remission:**
   - If achieved, consider maintenance dose of oral 5-ASA ± topical 5-ASA.
   - Patients with prior 5-ASA failure should consider immunomodulator therapy with AZA or 6-MP.

3. **No Remission:**
   - Use Budesonide-MMX.
   - If remission is achieved, continue maintenance 5-ASA. Consider AZA or 6-MP if needed.
   - If no remission, consider advanced therapy (biologics or tofacitinib) or colectomy.

### Severe Disease

1. **Initial Treatment:**
   - Oral prednisone (tapering to 0 over 12–16 weeks).

2. **Remission:**
   - If achieved, consider maintenance dose of oral 5-ASA ± topical 5-ASA.
   - Patients with prior 5-ASA failure should consider immunomodulator therapy with AZA or 6-MP.

3. **No Remission:**
   - Administer IV corticosteroids in hospital (3–10 days).

4. **Post-IV Corticosteroids:**
   - If remission is achieved, switch to oral prednisone and taper down to 0. Continue or restart oral 5-ASA. Consider AZA or 6-MP.
   - If no remission, consider advanced therapy (biologics or tofacitinib), IV cyclosporine (in select cases), or colectomy.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Treatment:**
   - Start with "Topical 5-ASA (4 wk)."

2. **Remission Check:**
   - If "Remission" is achieved:
     - **Yes:** Discontinue medication and follow the patient.
       - If "Recurrence" occurs, resume "5-ASA."
       - If "Recurrence" occurs again, proceed to oral prednisone treatment.
     - **No:** Add "Oral 5-ASA" (consider replacing topical 5-ASA with topical corticosteroids).

3. **Post-Oral 5-ASA Treatment:**
   - If "Remission" is achieved:
     - **Yes:** Continue previous effective therapy. Once stable, consider maintenance with either oral 5-ASA or topical agents.
       - If "Recurrence" occurs, proceed to oral prednisone treatment.
     - **No:** Administer "Budesonide-MMX."
       - If "Remission" is achieved, continue previous oral/topical therapy.
       - If "No Remission," proceed to oral prednisone treatment.

4. **Oral Prednisone Treatment:**
   - "Oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day tapering to 0 over 12–16 wk (see Table 1)."
   - Consider immunosuppressive therapy, biologic therapy, or surgery if necessary.

This flowchart outlines a step-by-step approach to managing Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis, with decisions based on remission status and recurrence.

Cortiment: multi-matrix formulation designed for colonic release of budesonide. Indicated for treatment of mild to moderate UC.Benefits are mostly due to its topical action since it is rapidly and almost completely degraded by hepatic first-pass metabolism. Exhibits somewhat fewer adverse effects than conventional corticosteroids. |
| **hydrocortisone sodium succinate** (Solu-Cortef, generics) | CD or UC:Acute exacerbation:300–400 mg/day IV until patient is stable then switch to prednisone PO | Acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain, hypertension, hypokalemia, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral head, suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, impaired wound healing. Caution in hyperthyroidism, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, cirrhosis. | Clearance may decrease with estrogens.May increase digitalis toxicity secondary to hypokalemia.Increased risk of hypokalemia with coadministration of diuretics. | Avoid immunization during corticosteroid use. No role in maintenance therapy. |
| **methylprednisolone sodium succinate** (Solu-Medrol, generics) | CD or UC:Acute exacerbation:40–60 mg/day IV until patient is stable then switch to prednisone PO | Acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain, hypertension, hypokalemia, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral head, suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, impaired wound healing.

Caution in hyperthyroidism, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, cirrhosis. | Clearance may decrease with estrogens.May increase digitalis toxicity secondary to hypokalemia.Increased risk of hypokalemia with coadministration of diuretics.Phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase metabolism, which may necessitate increased maintenance dose. | Useful in moderately severe and severe UC and CD. No role in maintenance therapy. |
| **budesonide, enema** (Entocort Enema) | CD or UC:Acute exacerbation:2 mg (100 mL) QHS PR | Topical therapy, in general, has less severe adverse effects than systemic therapy. |  | Enemas are effective in ulcerative proctitis and useful in UC; but their role in CD is not well established. As much as 75% of administered topical dose may be absorbed if the lower colon is severely inflamed. |

Give 25–33% of usual mercaptopurine dose if allopurinol is given concurrently and monitor for signs of toxicity (e.g., bone marrow suppression).Increased risk of neutropenia when combined with ACE inhibitors. | Metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine is influenced by a genetic polymorphism. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype testing could be considered prior to initiation of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to identify patients with functional mutations who are at increased risk of the myelosuppressive effects of thiopurines. |
| **azathioprine** (Imuran, generics) | CD or UC:2–2.5 mg/kg daily PO | Nausea, stomatitis, GI discomfort, arthralgias, diarrhea, anorexia, increased risk of opportunistic infection, blood dyscrasias, pancreatitis (rare), hepatotoxicity (rare). | May inhibit hypoprothrombinemic response to warfarin and possibly other anticoagulants.Coadministration with allopurinol may cause mercaptopurine toxicity. Give 25–33% of usual mercaptopurine dose if allopurinol is given concurrently and monitor for signs of toxicity (e.g., bone marrow suppression).Increased risk of neutropenia when combined with ACE inhibitors. | Metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine is influenced by a genetic polymorphism. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype testing could be considered prior to initiation of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to identify patients with functional mutations who are at increased risk of the myelosuppressive effects of thiopurines.Reduce dose in oliguric patients. |
| **cyclosporine** (Neoral, Sandimmune, generics) | UC:8 mg/kg/day PO​[1]Target PO doses to morning trough level 100–250 ng/mLor2–4 mg/kg/day IV (as continuous infusion over 24H)Target IV doses to morning trough level 250–450 ng/mL | Renal toxicity (monitor renal function), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hypertrichosis, cytopenia, gum hyperplasia, electrolyte imbalances, nausea, diarrhea, seizures, opportunistic infections. | Metabolized by CYP450: many possible drug interactions. | Patients responsive to IV therapy should be switched to PO when possible.May help avoid colectomy in select patients with severe disease not responding to other therapies. |
| **methotrexate** (Metoject, generics) | CD:15–25 mg IM/SC weekly | Nausea, flulike aches, headache, oral ulcers, bone marrow and liver toxicity, pneumonitis, immunosuppression, lymphoma. | Alcohol restriction may minimize hepatotoxicity. NSAIDs may increase methotrexate serum concentrations (probably not significant with low once-weekly methotrexate doses). Some penicillins may decrease methotrexate clearance. | Potentially hepatotoxic. Oral methotrexate has not been evaluated in controlled trials.Do not use in pregnancy. |
| **tofacitinib** (Xeljanz) | UC:Induction (≥8 wk):10 mg BID POMaintenance:5 mg BID PO | Headache, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, hypercholesterolemia, herpes zoster, anemia/neutropenia/lymphopenia.There is a boxed warning regarding risk of developing serious infections, malignancies, thrombosis or MACE. | Not recommended in patients coadministered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or patients coadministered with medications that result in moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19; risk of added immunosuppression when coadministered with potent immunosuppressive drugs; risk of decreased efficacy when coadministered with potent inducers of CYP3A4. | Discontinue if no benefit by week 16.Not recommended in combination with other biologics or immunosuppressants. |
