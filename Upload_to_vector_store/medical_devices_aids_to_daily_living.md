#### Introduction

Medical devices and aids to daily living (also called assistive devices) are an integral part of the contemporary home health-care market, a growing segment of health care. In 2022, estimates placed the size of the Canadian medical device market at approximately $9 billion.​[^[1]] The market itself is broad and, in addition to traditional items such as medical equipment, includes first aid and wound care products, sports medicine items, incontinence aids, palliative care products, and diagnostic equipment.

Several factors have combined to create this expanded market—longer life expectancies, technological advances and economies involved in modern health care. With over three-quarters of the Canadian population desiring to “age in place,” in their home rather than in a long-term care facility, the demand will likely increase.​[^[2]]

The Canadian population is living longer because of advances in medical knowledge and technology. According to the 2021 Canadian census, the population aged 85 and older increased by 12% from 2016 to 2021.​[^[3]] It is estimated that the portion of Canadians 65 years of age and older will increase rapidly until 2031 when all of the baby boomers will have reached 65 and that by 2036, these seniors could represent between 23% and 25% of the population.​[^[4]] Over time, more older people will be living in their own homes, requiring medical and assistive devices to carry out their day-to-day living.

In general, treatment in hospital is expensive on the health-care system, and both medical and assistive devices allow for less-costly home-based treatment. Patients are discharged earlier from the hospital for home recovery, and day surgery has become more common.

The use of medical and assistive devices has economic advantages and provides an improved quality of life by reducing or even eliminating a person’s disability: orthopedic patients (e.g., those with joint replacements or fractures) can be more mobile and independent during postoperative recovery periods. Individuals with brain damage (e.g., from trauma or stroke) or cerebrovascular disease (e.g., vascular dementia) can be better equipped to support daily living and self-care management. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are better equipped to manage their diseases. Patients with amputations can return home and rehabilitate in a more timely fashion. As well, caregivers use medical and assistive devices to facilitate the care they provide.

#### Medical Devices

Medical devices include a wide range of items. The legal definition is any article, instrument, apparatus or contrivance, including any component, part or accessory thereof, manufactured, sold, or represented for use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of a disease, disorder or abnormal physical state or its symptoms.​[^[5]] The definition also includes devices that could be used to restore, correct or modify a body function or body structure, to diagnose pregnancy, and to care for pregnant individuals and their offspring. It is a broad definition and at one time included products intended for animal use; however, the *Medical Devices Regulations* address products for human use only.​[^[6]]

In general terms, a medical device is any item of equipment, product or system that is ready-made, customized, or adapted and used to maintain or improve functional capabilities of people with a permanent disability or a temporary impairment or physical limitation. When choosing a medical or assistive device, several factors need to be considered. The physical, cognitive and emotional characteristics of the person for whom the piece of equipment is intended affect the choice. For example, a self-propelled wheelchair may increase mobility; however, if the individual does not have the physical strength or endurance to propel it, an electrical model may be a better choice. The nature of the activity also needs to be considered, e.g., whether the medical or assistive device is to be used at work, at home or in a social setting. Considerations include the social and cultural context, and whether the device is to be used in an institution or by the individual or caregiver. The degree of complication of the technology involved in the equipment is also a factor.

While a broad range of medical devices are listed in Table 1, this appendix focuses specifically on aids to daily living, bathroom aids especially for safety, bedroom aids for safety and mobility, mobility aids, respiratory aids, and home intravenous products. Of note is the growing area of health-care apps. These apps range from databases intended for health-care professionals to platforms providing health advice to the general public regarding such matters as “talk therapy,” heartbeat irregularities and physical activity levels.​[^[7]] It is beyond the scope of this appendix to discuss these apps; however, other types of medical devices are discussed elsewhere (see Diabetes Care Devices, Ostomy Care, Dressings, Pregnancy and Fertility Testing and Home Testing).

#### Home Safety Equipment

Home safety equipment is durable medical equipment that is able to withstand day-to-day wear and is intended for in-home use. At one time, high-quality equipment was available only in hospital or institutional settings, but today such equipment is intended for in-home use, either by the individual alone or with the assistance of a caregiver. Occupational therapists are a great resource in helping patients and their caregivers choose the appropriate equipment for improved home safety and physical ability. Occupational therapists are health-care professionals who collaborate with patients to enhance their capacity to perform daily living activities. In contrast, physiotherapists focus on the physical abilities of patients. Both professions contribute to patient rehabilitation.

Examples of larger pieces of durable medical equipment include patient lifts, hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen equipment and lift chairs. These enable individuals to remain in their home with an increased quality of life in cases of chronic medical conditions, palliative care situations and even normal aging.

Home safety equipment can be divided into 2 general groups: mobility aids, and bathroom and bedroom aids (for safety and mobility).

An area of growth is equipment designed for use by bariatric patients. In 2013, about 34% of Canadian adults were considered overweight and 27% had obesity.​[^[8]] Bariatric equipment is generally indicated for individuals with a BMI of greater than 30. The majority of standard equipment, such as wheelchairs, walkers or bath chairs, is intended for individuals weighing up to 250 pounds. Bariatric equipment is wider, made from heavy-duty material and is intended for people weighing more than standard equipment can support. The weight-carrying capacity is usually listed on the equipment. Examples of bariatric equipment include bath seats, transfer benches, walkers, wheelchairs, canes, crutches and commodes.  

#### Equipment for Bathroom Safety

Half of all falls involving Canadian seniors occur at home, with stairs and bathrooms posing the greatest risk.​[^[9]] Getting into or out of the bathtub presents a risk, and bath oil and bubble bath increase risk by making tubs more slippery.

 Showers are an alternative, but some individuals have difficulty standing in a shower. Chairs designed to be used in the shower are an option. Something as simple as a bath mat with suction cups reduces the risk of falls. Bathtub and shower grab bars and poles, along with tub rails, make a bathroom safer.​[^[10]] Hand-held or portable shower nozzles facilitate washing while standing or sitting.

#### Shampoo Trays and Caps

For people confined to bed or in a wheelchair, shampoo trays make washing hair possible. Rinse-free shampoo caps are now being used in and out of hospital to allow cleaning of the hair without the use of running water.

#### Inflatable Bathtubs

Inflatable vinyl tubs fit over a bed and come with a hand-held shower and hose, making bathing in bed a possibility.

#### Bath Boards/Bathtub Transfer Benches

Bathtub transfers are a cause of anxiety in individuals with permanent or temporary physical limitations, as this is when most falls occur. Requiring assistance in a bathtub transfer may be a sign of lost independence and privacy to some individuals.

Bath boards sit across the tub and usually have handgrips. They are ideal for storing soap and sponges within easy reach and for helping to maintain stability when stepping out of the bathtub. Bath boards are anchored to the inside tub edges with adjustable clamps/grips. The board is the same height as the tub edge and allows the individual to sit on the edge and slide across the board for a sit-down shower or sponge bath.

Transfer benches straddle the bathtub with 2 legs outside the tub and 2 legs inside the tub. The individual sits on the seat outside the bathtub, much like they would in a chair. While seated, they can move their legs 1 at a time over the bathtub edge and into the bathtub, pulling themselves over to the portion of the seat positioned above the bath water (see Figure 1).

Transfer benches have adjustable heights but are not suitable for deep designer bathtubs. Several trial runs while fully clothed and without bath water are recommended, to adjust the bench to the correct height and to become comfortable with the movement needed. The sitting surfaces must be slippery enough so that the transfer is easy, but not so slippery that someone may slide off the surface, especially when it is wet. Transfer benches and boards usually have water drainage holes in the seat surface to prevent the seat from becoming too slippery.

Transfer benches should be easy to clean, and if not permanent, they should be light and easy to position. Suction cups and/or rubber tips limit movement of the equipment during transfers. Most have side grab bars and backrests. They should be adjustable so that a person can enter the tub from either the right or the left.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a step-by-step illustration demonstrating how to safely transfer into a bathtub using a bench and a walker. It consists of three labeled steps:

1. **A: Approaching bench**
   - A person is standing with the aid of a walker, positioned next to a bathtub with a transfer bench. The individual is holding the walker with one hand and the bench with the other, preparing to sit.

2. **B: Sitting securely on bench**
   - The person is now seated on the bench, facing the walker. They are holding onto the walker for stability, with both feet still outside the tub.

3. **C: Moving one leg at a time over edge of tub**
   - The person is seated on the bench and is shown moving one leg at a time over the edge of the tub into the bathtub. This step emphasizes careful movement to ensure safety.

The illustration is designed to guide individuals, particularly those with mobility challenges, on how to safely enter a bathtub using a transfer bench and a walker.

#### Bath/Shower Seats

Bath/shower seats have 4 legs set inside the tub or shower, allowing an individual to sit down while bathing. Some have backrests, and all have suction cups or rubber tips on the legs to prevent them from slipping. Suction-cup legs, adjustable leg heights, back support, and non-slip, easy-to-clean surfaces are desirable features.

#### Raised Toilet Seats

Raised toilet seats facilitate sitting down and getting up from the toilet and enable more comfortable transfers from wheelchair to toilet seat. Most raised toilet seats add 4 inches to the toilet height, although some are adjustable up to 6.5 inches. For safety reasons, raised toilet seats should attach directly to the toilet bowl by means of clamps. Raised toilet seats are portable and can be used when travelling.

Some raised toilet seats have a cut-out area for leg positioning in patients with limited range of movement at the hip or other conditions that prevent a normal flexed sitting position, e.g., following hip-replacement surgery.

Raised toilet seats may have attached hand grips. A safety bar can be attached to the wall next to the toilet and hand rails can be used on a regular-height toilet. A trial run will help with the appropriate placement (see Figure 2).

Most toilet seats are between 15 and 17 inches in height from floor to toilet bowel rim; however, many contemporary toilet seats are available in a height up to 19 inches, also termed a “comfort” height. These higher toilet seats may be considered if bathroom renovations are being considered.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a line drawing of a toilet with a raised toilet seat. The raised seat is designed to assist individuals who may have difficulty sitting down or standing up from a standard toilet height, often used in medical or home care settings. The seat has an open front, which is a common design for accessibility and hygiene purposes. The toilet is depicted from an angled perspective, showing the tank, bowl, and the raised seat attachment. There are no additional labels or annotations in the image.

#### Miscellaneous

Assistive devices such as wash mitts, wash sponges (some have a pocket for a bar of soap), long-handled scrubbing brushes/sponges and tap turners make bathing easier and may help prevent falls. The toilet tissue dispenser should be within easy reach. Grab bars and safety railings can be placed at convenient locations in the bathroom in order to aid the movements needed to toilet or bathe, but towel racks should never be used as grab bars, as they are not able to support an individual’s weight.  

Various toilet assistive devices enable individuals with limited manual dexterity to use toilet tissue and clean themselves. Bedpans and urinals facilitate toileting when bedridden. Commodes, with or without wheels, can be used next to a bed for toileting when an individual cannot safely walk to the bathroom. Splash­guards can be attached to any commode seat that sits higher than the toilet bowl.

Durable medical equipment is used in the bedroom for both safety and mobility. Bed rails help individuals get into bed and prevent them from falling out of bed. There are many devices that are used to prevent pressure ulcers, e.g., foam or sheepskin pads, heel protectors. Cushions, pillows and antisnore devices help improve comfort and sleep.

#### Mobility Aids

Decreased mobility for an individual may mean limited participation in activities of daily living and/or being housebound, bedridden or even institutionalized. It may happen postsurgically as well, e.g., after a joint replacement or as a result of a broken bone. It has associated health risks such as thromboembolism. Equipment to assist with mobility includes canes, walkers, crutches and wheelchairs.

Physiotherapists are a valuable resource in helping patients determine which mobility aid is most suitable for their needs.

#### Canes and Walkers

Canes and walkers increase safety and confidence with mobility by reducing instability. Aluminum canes and walkers are lightweight and adjustable, thus easily maneuvered and ideal for individuals who, because of age or disease, do not have optimal muscle strength. Wooden canes are often heavier and must be cut to adjust the length.

Canes and walkers should be measured to ensure a correct fit.​[^[11]] The distance from the top of a cane or walker handle to the ground should equal the distance from the wrist crease to the ground when the arm is straight down at the side. The measurement should be performed with the individual standing erect and wearing everyday shoes. If the cane is too short, the user will lean forward. If it is too long, the lean will be backward. Adjustable and telescopic canes enable an individual to find the correct fit. Walkers are measured in a similar manner, and most are adjustable.

A cane handle should afford an easy yet firm grip. A swan’s neck handle is easier for balancing, and many handles have moulded grips. Metal and wooden cane tips or walker feet tend to slip. Rubber tips are required to help prevent slips and falls, and are replaceable. A flip-back ice-gripping tip can be attached to the tip of a cane for extra stability in winter. Quad bases (4 legs) add balance to canes, and different sized bases are available for stability, as are rotating tips for uneven ground. Although canes are most comfortably held in the dominant hand, holding the cane in the hand contralateral to the weak or injured side will provide the most balance as well as decrease in pain and weight-bearing on the affected side. A cane should be advanced with the leg contralateral to the painful side.

Walkers may have 4, 2 or no wheels and the wheels may be permanent or removable. Some walkers feature a handbreak, which will lock the rear wheels. Walker accessories include tote bags, baskets, trays, attached seats and carriers for oxygen tanks. A folding walker eases transportation. Walkers with no wheels offer the most balance but require upper body strength to lift the walker and advance forward. Four-wheeled walkers allow for a smooth and quick gait, but require more coordination and balance than the 2-wheeled walkers. Two-wheeled walkers provide aspects of both balance and smooth movement.

#### Crutches

Crutches are used as mobility aids and support for knee, leg or ankle injuries. They may be required on a short- or long-term basis, depending upon whether the injury heals or is ongoing. There are 2 broad categories: forearm or elbow crutches, which are used more often on a long-term basis, and axillary or underarm crutches, which are mainly for short-term use (see Figure 3). 

Forearm crutches have handgrips, and the crutches extend above the wrist where they are secured by a cuff or collar at the forearm. The majority of forearm crutches are adjustable; however, the appropriate fit is needed. With the arms relaxed at the sides of the body, the handgrip should be level with the wrist. The cuffs should fit around the forearm just below the elbow with a space of 1–2 inches to allow the elbow to bend. The flex in the elbow ideally should be 15–30° for stability and comfort.

![](images/meddevaidlivpsc_crusty.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is an illustration of three types of crutches, each labeled with a letter and description:

1. **A: Hinged forearm crutch**
   - This crutch features a forearm support with a hinge mechanism. It has a handle for gripping and an adjustable shaft for height customization. The hinge allows for flexibility in movement.

2. **B: Forearm crutch without hinge**
   - Similar to the first, this crutch has a forearm support but lacks a hinge. It includes a handle and an adjustable shaft, providing stability without the flexibility of a hinge.

3. **C: Underarm crutch**
   - This crutch is designed to fit under the arm. It has a padded top for comfort under the armpit, a handgrip, and an adjustable shaft. It is typically used for more traditional support.

Each crutch type is designed to aid mobility, offering different levels of support and flexibility based on the user's needs.

*AI-generated description for accessibility and content understanding*


Axillary (underarm) crutches provide support for a lower body injury. The arm pads should not be tight against the axilla, but rather there should be space enough for 2 or 3 fingers or about 1–1.5 inches between the arm pad and the axilla. The handgrip should be adjusted so that with hands in place, the arm is flexed about 15–30°. Most crutches are adjustable to ensure proper fit.

With forearm crutches, the body’s weight is off the armpits, but the hands are not as free as with the underarm crutches.

If one crutch is used, it should be used opposite the injury; however, with 2 crutches, it is important to remember to move the crutches first, then the body. Forearm crutches are more difficult to learn to use, but they enable the user to be mobile on various surfaces and are ideal for more active individuals with a chronic injury.

Various handgrips are available. Some have extra padding or gel covers and others have ergonomic design. Forearm crutches have a variety of cuffs for comfort and durability. Some forearm crutches have hinged cuffs allowing the crutch to drop away when the wearer reaches for an object (see Figure 4). The arm pads of axillary crutches are also available with a variety of padding for comfort.

![](images/medicaldevicesaidsdailylivingpsc_hinforcru.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a line drawing illustrating the correct use of a forearm crutch. It shows a person's arm positioned with the hand gripping the handle of the crutch. The forearm is supported by a cuff that wraps around it, providing stability. The crutch is depicted as having a vertical shaft extending downward, which would make contact with the ground. The illustration emphasizes the proper alignment and grip necessary for effective use of a forearm crutch.

*AI-generated description for accessibility and content understanding*




It is important to remember that crutches should be used when an injury needs to have no weight on it and canes or walkers should be used when enhanced balance is required; the 2 types of mobility aids are not interchangeable. Two other options are available to increase mobility with a lower leg injury: hands-free crutches and knee scooters. Both attach at the knee, with the hands-free crutches acting to replace the injured lower leg, while the knee scooter has wheels that allow for ease of mobility. Knee scooters are difficult to operate over uneven ground and up and down stairs.

#### Wheelchairs

Wheelchairs should provide comfortable and functional mobility.​[^[12]] Consider the everyday routine of the individual before choosing a wheelchair because the choice can vary depending on activities (e.g., going to work, participating in sports). More than 1 wheelchair may be required to perform different activities.

The method of propulsion of the wheelchair may be independent or assisted by another person. Independent propulsion refers not only to propelling wheels or hand rims manually, but also to the use of electrical controls with the hand, mouth, legs or feet.

Positioning of an individual in a wheelchair should provide adequate balance and support. The buttocks should bear equal loads, with adequate back support. Ideally, the shoulder should align vertically with the elbows, with the arms resting at right angles. The knees and ankles should be at right angles as well. When the individual’s centre of gravity is ahead of the wheelchair axle, the wheelchair is more stable, while propulsion is easier when the centre of gravity is over the axle. People with severe disabilities may not be able to achieve the ideal position, and adaptation of the chair may be needed, for example with foam inserts.

Wheelchair seat dimensions should fit with body dimensions. A chair that is too large or too small does not function well for the user. The seat and back should not sag. To ensure proper positioning, seat height and individual requirements, the patient should be assessed while sitting in the chair. 

The environment in which the chair will be used is a key factor.​[^[13]] If the chair is to be used indoors, its size and maneuverability must be considered as well as the architectural features of the building or room in question. Measure doorways and check the turning axis of the chair to ensure the wheelchair fits through doorways, both at home and at work.

Wheelchairs used outdoors should be able to negotiate uneven ground, slopes and curbs. This is a major limitation of wheelchairs in that they were designed to function on constructed surfaces, and they perform poorly outdoors, e.g., in the park, on the beach.

Wheelchairs used for leisure activities may require high-performance features and should be easy to transport. Appearance and styling may be important. Certain sports (e.g., basketball, track) require specialized wheelchairs that are light and durable with easy maneuverability.

When travelling by car, close access to the car seat eases transferring between chair and car. Lightweight chairs with detachable or swing-away armrests and footrests make transfers and transportation easier. Transporter wheelchairs are lightweight and foldable and are intended for occasional use, such as shopping in a mall or moving through an airport.

Wheelchair accessories can increase comfort and mobility, and can reduce health risks. Wheelchair cushions reduce pressure sores and support the head. Harnesses and seat belts provide support and increase safety. Trays, bags, stump boards, umbrellas and rain hoods, pushing gloves and cuffs, portable ramps, padding, specialized cushions, and transfer boards are other examples of wheelchair accessories.

Wheelchair manufacturers use different terms to describe the same features. Check with the manufacturer to clarify the terms and descriptions.

#### Patient Comfort Aids

Patient comfort aids include pressure therapy, pillows, cushions, elastic compression stockings, and back, neck and limb braces. Some of these devices are used therapeutically as well as for comfort.

#### Elastic Compression Stockings

Elastic compression stockings are also known as surgical or support stockings or hose. In the simplest form, support stockings are intended to relieve tired, aching legs and prevent swelling of feet, ankles and legs. Individuals who stand or sit for long periods of time or older individuals with compromised venous return are ideal candidates for these stockings. Compression stockings may be prescribed for medical conditions such as varicose veins, lymphedema, venous eczema and ulceration, deep vein thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome.​[^[14]]

Elastic compression stockings decrease superficial venous pressure, increase the upward flow in unoccluded deep and superficial veins, and raise local interstitial pressure. Compression of the leg also prevents some edema. Compression stockings are designed to give graduated support with the most pressure exerted at the ankle, less at the calf and the least at the thigh.​[^[15]] They provide varying compression, ranging from 12–60 mm Hg at the ankle. No single standard classification of compression is used. The most common is low or class 1 of less than 20 mm Hg, medium or class 2 of 20–30 mm Hg, and high or class 3 of >30 mm Hg.

Proper fit is essential to ensure comfort and effectiveness. Ill-fitting stockings may be the reason an individual discontinues wearing them. Some stockings, especially ones with high compression, may be esthetically unappealing for some wearers who, as a result, choose not to wear them. The most common reasons for not being able to wear compression stockings include skin damage (especially seeping, open wounds), allergy to any of the stocking components, extensive leg edema or a malformed leg, a history of peripheral artery disease, and marked impairment of sensation in the leg.

A correct fit requires accurate measurements of the nonedematous leg first thing in the morning. To ensure effective compression, the stocking should be washed and dried according to the manufacturer’s directions and replaced every 2–3 months. They are intended to be removed at night and put on in the morning before beginning daily activities. Manual dexterity is needed to put on or remove the stockings, and devices are available to assist with this.

Compression stockings are available as pantyhose or socks (above or below the knee), with open or closed toes and in various colours (see Figure 5). The required compression and affected leg area should be the starting point in selection.

Antiembolism stockings are worn by the nonambulatory individual to prevent venous emboli caused by inactivity. They provide less support and are not suitable for ambulatory individuals.

Nontherapeutic elastic stocking are widely available and often used by air travellers or by people who feel they have “tired legs.” Precise measurements are not needed and the compression is usually uniform throughout the stocking. For air travellers, the wearing of compression stockings on flights of 4 hours or more reduces the risk moderately for superficial vein thrombosis. Travellers also may experience less leg edema; however, it is unclear if the wearing of these stockings translates into effects on deep vein thrombosis.​[^[16]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is an illustration showing three types of compression stockings, each labeled with a letter and description:

1. **A: Below-the-knee stocking**
   - Depicts a person wearing a stocking that extends from the foot to just below the knee.

2. **B: Above-the-knee stocking**
   - Shows a person wearing a stocking that extends from the foot to above the knee, covering part of the thigh.

3. **C: Pantyhose-style stocking**
   - Illustrates a person wearing a full-length stocking that covers from the feet up to the waist, similar to pantyhose.

Each type of stocking is shown on a separate figure, highlighting the different lengths and coverage areas of the stockings. The illustration is likely intended to demonstrate the variations in compression stocking styles for medical or therapeutic use.

#### Respiratory Aids

#### Peak Flow or PEF Meters

Along with established predictive value of respiratory symptoms, peak flow meters help predict and prevent exacerbations in a chronic pulmonary condition such as asthma. While they allow for home monitoring of a patient’s lung function and titration of medication, it is important that their use is linked to an action plan. Use of peak flow meters is contentious, and the Canadian Thoracic Society notes that most people do not require monitoring of peak expiratory flow (PEF). Home monitoring may be suitable for adult patients who are poor perceivers of airway obstruction and for patients with severe asthma; however, in many cases, monitoring of symptoms may be sufficient.​[^[17]]

Peak flow meters comes in 2 main types: mechanical and digital. These devices measure PEF, which represents the speed of air that can be forced out after the lungs are fully inflated. PEF reflects how effectively air moves through the airways. Lower PEF measurements indicate poorer airflow. Mechanical peak flow meters measure only PEF, while digital peak flow meters measure both PEF and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). FEV1 represents the volume of air expelled in the first second of exhalation.​[^[18]] Peak flow meters require a mouthpiece, typically providing 2 mouthpieces to accommodate both children and adults. 

After a complete exhalation, the individual inhales as deeply as possible, places the meter in the mouth and blows out as hard and fast as possible. The final position of the indicator on the scale is the PEF measured in litres per minute. Three consecutive readings are taken, and the highest of the 3 is recorded. Children as young as 4 years of age are able to perform this test.

While it is recommended that daily measurements be taken at 12-hour intervals (e.g., 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.), measurements should be taken at times that are convenient and clinically significant for the individual. Measurements are recorded in a log or graph, which is supplied with many meters. A note is made if inhaled corticosteroids or beta-agonists are used either before or after the test. These values are compared to “predicted normal” values depending on age, gender, height and weight. A better approach is comparison to the individual’s personal best, which is the highest PEF recorded over a 2- to 3-week period during which asthma is under control.

A zoning system is usually used to make the test reading relevant for the patient. One frequently used zoning system is based on traffic lights. A result in the green zone correlates to 80–100% of the individual’s personal best, yellow 60–80% and red <60%. In the yellow zone, medication may have to be re-evaluated, and in the red zone, a bronchodilator is immediately required. If a reading appears in the red zone twice within a 48-hour period, medical attention should be sought.

Problems that can cause false readings include the wrong size of mouthpiece, the indicator not being at the bottom of the scale before the test is begun, fingers blocking part of the mouthpiece opening and atmospheric pressure effects. To ensure accuracy of peak flow meters, individuals should be encouraged to take their meter to appointments with health-care practitioners to compare the readings with spirometry results.

#### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machines

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines are used to treat obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Individuals affected by the syndrome experience cessation of breathing (apnea) or shallow breathing (hypopnea) during sleep, which affects the quality and quantity of sleep and results in daytime drowsiness. A mask fits over the face and the CPAP machine maintains an air pressure in the mask that is slightly greater than the surrounding air, which promotes normal breathing. Adherence to CPAP therapy is low; the machine itself is cumbersome, and other potential factors include sleep disturbance and claustrophobia. Education, correct fit of the mask, and air humidification of the bedroom may increase use.

One symptom of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome is snoring. Various devices are available to reduce snoring along with the sleep apnea-hypopnea. Oral appliances reposition the mouth, allowing improved breathing and adhesive nasal strips to be applied to the bridge of the nose to open nasal passages.

#### Oxygen Therapy

Ambulatory and hospice patients may require oxygen therapy. With the available technology (e.g., face masks, nasal cannulae, oxygen concentrators, tracheal or endotracheal tubes), oxygen therapy is more portable.

Oxygenated water and ozone therapy are touted as beneficial; however, both are expensive and lack evidence supporting their effectiveness.

#### Pulse Oximeters

Pulse oximeters are medical devices that measure both the pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that the blood is carrying, expressed as a percentage. These devices are attached to either the index or middle finger where they detect the pulse rate. By passing a beam of light through the fingernail bed, they also determine the oxygen saturation value.

While pulse oximeters are commonly used in hospital and institutional settings, their use is expanding to other settings. For example, they are increasingly employed for in-home measurements during disease states such as COVID-19 infections, as well as in private aviation and mountain climbing. A reading of 94–100% is considered to be the normal range.​[^[19]]

Proper positioning of the device is crucial, and several factors can impact the accuracy of the reading. Dark skin tones, blue or black nail polish, and artificial fingernails may interfere with accurate measurement. Additionally, colder temperatures and intravenous dyes can also affect readings. If a low reading is recorded, it is essential for the patient to seek medical attention. However, it is important not to ignore other symptoms of hypoxia such as difficulty breathing; shortness of breath; chest pain; fast heart rate or pulse; and blue or white face, lips or nails.​[^[20]]

#### Nasal Irrigation Devices

Nasal irrigation devices are used to remove excess mucous from nasal cavities. Also termed nasal lavage or douching, nasal irrigation can be useful as an adjunct to oral therapy in treating the symptoms of rhinosinusitis and chronic sinusitis. Various devices are available, e.g., neti pot (see Figure 6), but all use the technique of pouring saline into one nostril and allowing it to drain through the other nostril. Gravity and tilting the head facilitate the procedure. Care must be taken to use only distilled or sterile water for nasal irrigation in order to prevent potential infections and parasite infestation.​[^[21]] Alternatively, tap water may be boiled for 1 minute and allowed to cool down before use. Boiled tap water may be stored for 24 hours.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is an illustration showing a person using a neti pot for nasal irrigation. The individual is tilting their head to one side and holding the neti pot with one hand. The spout of the neti pot is inserted into one nostril, allowing the liquid to flow through the nasal passage and out the other nostril. This process is typically used to clear nasal congestion and remove mucus or allergens from the nasal cavity. The person appears to be following the correct technique for using a neti pot.

#### Vaporizers/Humidifiers

Vaporizers use heat to disperse moisture into the air, which increases the temperature of the space in which they are used. Steam or spills from vaporizers can cause burns. Humidifiers require no heat. They increase humidity by physically dispersing water droplets into the air.

The use of distilled water prevents some mineral buildup in humidifiers; however, vaporizers require some minerals in the water to produce vapour. Regular cleaning of humidifiers and vaporizers is essential to remove debris and limit microbial growth, thus reducing the risk of infection and allergic reactions. Medication should not be added to humidifiers; if used with vaporizers, medication should be placed only in the medication cup (not the water reservoir).

#### Home Intravenous Programs

Patients with chronic illness and serious infections may require long hospitalizations away from family, friends and work; however, they might be well enough to reside at home if they are able to obtain the required medication. Home intravenous programs have been developed to meet this need.​[^[22]]

Examples of therapies that can be administered through home intravenous programs include:​[^[23]]



Home intravenous programs represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the home health-care market. Several factors are responsible:



To succeed with a home intravenous program, the patient and their family must feel comfortable with the technology and skill required. The patient must have adequate cognitive function and no psychosis or substance use disorder, both of which can adversely impact adherence (see Table 3).

| Positive Criteria | Negative Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Adherence to programManageable infection/diseaseMedical stabilitySufficient cognitive functionVenous access | Home without running water, electricity, refrigerationImpaired visionSubstance abuse |


Most home intravenous patients have a venous catheter to which tubing and a prepared intravenous drug are attached. The drug infusion takes place over a specified period of time and is accomplished either by gravity or with the use of a pump. The catheter chosen may be a short peripheral line, midline or central line (e.g., Broviac, Hickman or Groshong), depending on duration of therapy, the need for blood sampling, age of the patient, drug properties (e.g., vesicant) and other factors.​[^[23]] A heparin lock may be used.

Subcutaneous infusion pumps are implanted devices used to infuse medication, blood products, fluids or nutrition. The pump appears as a raised area under the skin surface. There is a port with a self-sealing silicone rubber septum through which a Huber needle is inserted. The medication enters the body through tubing attached to the Huber needle.

Analgesic pumps are portable external devices that pump analgesic medications, typically morphine, through tubing and into a small needle placed in the subcutaneous tissue. The pump controls the flow of medication and is usually programmed to provide a set dose per time period. The pump can also be used manually with the patient having some control over dosage, but the pump is programmed to provide a limited quantity per time period. The pump is hung outside the tub when showering or bathing and placed under the pillow or hung on a hook when sleeping. Avoid exposing the pump to humidity, heat or freezing.

Parenteral nutrition bypasses the GI tract completely and is infused into the circulation. With total parenteral nutrition (TPN), there may be a loss of GI function; therefore, returning to orally provided nutrition may be problematic.

#### Complications

Phlebitis, infiltration and infection at the catheter site are the most common problems. Air emboli, dislodged catheters, migrating ports, catheter leaks and occlusion can also occur. Prepared intravenous solutions must be stored carefully, most often in the refrigerator and sometimes in the freezer.

#### Aids to Daily Living (Assistive Devices)

The term “aids to daily living” refers to assistive devices that make day-to-day life easier for both individuals and caregivers by facilitating the performance of personal care tasks, e.g., canes, wheelchairs, clothing with Velcro closures, handle grips for cutlery. They can enable an individual to avoid institutionalization.​[^[24]]

Assistive devices are often recommended by occupational therapists who evaluate and recommend adaptations that enable an individual’s daily living activities to continue. Mastering the correct technique for using an assistive device can enable individuals to relearn a skill, perform a task in a new manner or use equipment to perform a task.​[^[25]] The emphasis is on simplifying a task, planning ahead, organizing the task, sitting and resting regularly when possible, and using correct body mechanics. Table 4 lists some common aids to daily living.
