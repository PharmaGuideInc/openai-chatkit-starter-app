#### Introduction

Interacting with patients effectively is a key role for pharmacists. Throughout an interaction, the participants (e.g., the pharmacist and the patient) alternate between the roles of “sender” and “receiver” of the message. Information should not be provided in a unidirectional manner. Rather, information is exchanged. As a receiver, the pharmacist has the responsibility of listening to what the patient is saying, understanding the issue and providing feedback on whether the message was understood. As the sender, the pharmacist has the responsibility of transmitting the message clearly, in language understood by the patient and in an environment conducive to clear transmission.

For effective patient interaction, pharmacists should display empathy and compassion for the patient’s situation. When sending information, consider how the interaction is organized and how well verbal and nonverbal communication skills are used. 

When receiving information, pharmacists should take note of what the patient is saying and observe their use of verbal and nonverbal communication throughout the interaction to ensure that a full description of the presenting complaint and associated symptoms, as well as other relevant information, are gathered.

There are 3 major stages or types of patient interactions: assessment and triage, education, and follow-up. This chapter provides guidance on how these interactions can be organized and gives examples of the topics and questions that could be included. Examples of application in a community pharmacy setting are provided; however, these skills can be applied in all areas of practice. Further detailed discussion of the process of assessment and triage can be found in Pharmacist Process for Care of the Self-Treating Patient.

#### Assessment and Triage

The primary purposes of this stage of the interaction with a patient are to determine the nature of the patient’s concerns or symptoms and to determine whether it is within the pharmacist’s scope of practice to address these concerns or if referral to another provider is necessary. Use these initial steps in greeting the patient, finding out about the problem, and ensuring comfort and privacy. The interaction then may progress to the pharmacist conducting the patient interview and assessment process. The emphasis is on skillfully eliciting relevant information from the patient so that the pharmacist gains a complete picture of the patient’s issue and does not jump to conclusions about what the patient needs. This is also the point at which the pharmacist begins to build rapport with the patient and earns that person’s trust.

#### How



Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in Figure 1.

Use good communication skills. This will both help you send messages in a manner that can be understood by the patient and help you understand the messages that you receive. Both verbal and nonverbal communication skills are important and should complement one another. Good verbal communication skills and poor or distracting nonverbal skills send conflicting messages, and the patient may become confused or lose confidence in the pharmacist. The reverse is also true.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart designed to guide healthcare professionals in interacting with patients. Here’s a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Introduce yourself or greet the patient by name if known**
   - This is the initial step to establish rapport.

2. **Find out briefly what the patient needs**
   - Example questions include:
     - “How can I help you?”
     - “What brings you in today?”
     - “Tell me about the symptoms you’re having.”
   - It suggests avoiding closed-ended questions like “Can I help you?” which might prompt a “No.”

3. **Explain, in a general way, how you can help**
   - Example explanation:
     - “I may be able to help you feel better. I’ll need to ask you a few questions about how you’re feeling to make sure what I recommend can work and is safe for you to take.”

4. **Ensure comfort and privacy to demonstrate concern for the patient’s feelings and the importance of confidentiality**
   - Suggestions include:
     - Offering tissues, water, a chair.
     - Asking if a private area is preferred for talking.
     - Inquiring if the patient needs to use any of their own medications now.

5. **Proceed with questioning and listening for assessment and triage**
   - Begin with open-ended questions to gather information, e.g., “Tell me about your headache.”
   - Move to more closed-ended questions for specific information, e.g., “Have you tried any medications for your headache?”

6. **Referral (if required)**
   - Example referral statement:
     - “From what you’ve described, I think it would be best to see your doctor about this.”
   - If the referral is not accepted, use concern and empathy, offer to call ahead or send a note, e.g., “I’m really concerned about how you’re feeling and I think it’s important that your doctor see you as soon as possible. If you like, I can send a fax about what we’ve already discussed and medications you’ve tried.”

This flowchart emphasizes effective communication, patient comfort, and appropriate referral processes.

Verbal communication skills include the ability to question appropriately (see Table 1), using language the patient can understand (see Table 2), listening effectively (see Table 3) and responding using empathy (see Table 4).

Nonverbal communication transmits more than half of the messages that people send and receive. These skills must be practised when the pharmacist is both speaking and listening to the patient. Techniques to optimize nonverbal communication are outlined in Table 5.

The importance of listening and being empathetic, through effective verbal and nonverbal communication, cannot be underestimated. Spending time without being distracted, as well as understanding patient feelings and perspectives without judging, criticizing or blaming, builds acceptance and respect that creates a strong patient-pharmacist relationship.

| Use open-ended questions: | Use closed-ended questions: | Avoid: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When you need to gather symptom information that is most prominent in the patient’s mindWhen you need to begin a line of questioningWhen you want to determine the patient’s understanding, level of sophistication of the assessment of the problem and level of vocabulary that would be appropriate for you to useTo convey a willingness to listenTo promote rapport and trustExamples:Describe... (the feeling to me)Explain... (how the pain feels)Tell me about... (the heartburn)How... (does the headache feel?)What... (brings you in today?) | When you want a yes, no or number responseWhen you want to gather specific, focused information about the nature of the symptoms and treatmentWhen you need to gather information quicklyWhen you need to keep a talkative patient focusedExamples:Do you... (have any discharge?)Have you... (ever had this before?)Will you... (be able to take this every 4 hours?)How many times... (do you wake up during the night?) | Using only open-ended questions (will make the discussion much longer and unfocused)Using only closed-ended questions (will prevent discussion from moving to details of which you are unaware; may create passivity)Asking several questions in succession without patient input. For example, asking “Is the pain mostly in your stomach or is it more like heartburn?” “What does it feel like?” “Do you usually get it after you eat?” one after another without giving the patient a chance to answerAsking leading or biased questions. For example, “There isn’t any blood in your stool, is there?”Asking questions that start with “why” (can seem judgmental and cause defensiveness)Using slang or medical terminology |

| You are listening when you: | You are not listening when you: |
| --- | --- |
| Encourage talking, e.g., “hmm,” “yes,” “go on”Wait during silence (allows the patient a chance to think and react)Repeat (“So, you’re having difficulty sleeping”)Reflect (“How do you feel about that?”)Explore (“Could you say a bit more about that?”)Summarize accuratelyAsk questionsParaphrase | Are in a hurry (e.g., looking at watch)InterruptChange subject for no apparent reasonAsk a question twiceDon’t ask any questions at allAre talkingDon’t allow the patient a chance to finish speakingLectureCut off expressions of feelingGive advice prematurely |


| Use empathy: | Avoid automatically giving the following responses until you understand what the patient is feeling: |
| --- | --- |
| Make an effort to understand how the patient is feeling;​[b] respond to that feeling (e.g., “That must be incredibly difficult; I can imagine how painful that is”)Some of what the patient tells you involves his or her feelings about it; be sensitive to those feelings | Judgmental or critical responses (“You shouldn’t be doing that”)Advising/recommending responsesReassuring responses (“You’ll be fine”)Generalizing responses (“Everybody feels that way”)Distracting responses, e.g., changing the subject |


| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Smile (when appropriate)Demonstrate genuine interest and concernMaintain eye contact as culturally and socially appropriateUse appropriate body language (show interest and concern in your facial expression, maintain appropriate distance from the patient, keep your body posture open, lean forward)Sit or squat if the patient is sitting, stand if the patient is standingHave a neat and clean personal appearance and a neat and clean physical environment | Look down or away repeatedlyLook at or touch other objects repeatedlyCross your arms or your legsUse distracting gesturesTilt to one sideSlouchStareGet so close that you are in the patient’s “personal space”Have barriers between you and the patient (high counter) |


#### Education

The main purposes of this stage of interaction are to review available treatment options and provide education that will enable the patient to gain the most benefit. Again, the pharmacist acts as both the “sender” and “receiver” of messages, but with more emphasis on sending messages to the patient. To ensure education is effective, pay attention to transmitting the message clearly and explicitly without adhering to a strict monologue type of interaction. Continually check for understanding throughout and pay attention to new information that the patient may offer.

#### How



Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in Figure 2.

Use strong verbal and nonverbal communication skills. The same skills highlighted in the Follow-Up section apply. Additional verbal skills that are useful in the educational component of the interaction include the rate, volume, tone and pitch of speech. These are outlined in Table 6.

 The nonverbal skills used in educating are the same as those used in assessment and triage. You may need to use additional nonverbal skills to indicate the closure of the interaction. Examples are standing up (if sitting), changing stance, shaking hands, and sometimes packing up papers or putting pen and paper away.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart outlining a structured approach for healthcare providers to communicate effectively with patients. It consists of several steps, each with specific actions and considerations:

1. **Establish Goals**
   - Determine the patient's expectations of treatment (e.g., cure, symptom relief).
   - Discuss reasonable expectations.
   - Clarify the time frame of expectations and explain what is reasonable.

2. **Collect Information**
   - Identify what treatments have or have not worked in the past.
   - Determine patient preferences, considering side effects, convenience, cost, beliefs, and values.
   - Inquire about other drugs and medical conditions that might affect treatment choices.
   - If multiple products are available, explain their advantages and disadvantages.

3. **Provide Information**
   - Emphasize important points and provide reasons.
   - Give definite and explicit instructions, including the duration of therapy.
   - Ensure clarity to avoid misunderstandings.
   - Use written information in a readable font size; do not rely solely on product labels.

4. **Check for Understanding**
   - Request feedback to confirm understanding, e.g., "Can you tell me the most important points to remember?"
   - Ask for demonstrations if applicable, e.g., "Show me how you would measure this drug for the baby."
   - Observe for signs of understanding, such as nodding or verbal affirmations.
   - Ask if there are questions and clarify any misunderstandings.

5. **Close**
   - Summarize important points, acknowledging the patient's concerns and reiterating key advice.
   - Explain any required monitoring and follow-up, specifying who should perform these tasks.
   - Arrange a time and date for a follow-up call if necessary.
   - End the conversation graciously.

**Challenge:**
- If a patient continues to talk after a recommendation is made and education is provided, use nonverbal techniques or closed-ended questions like "Do you have any further questions?" to close the interview effectively.

#### Follow-Up

Use follow-up to determine whether the patient’s goals were achieved with the plan selected and that no red flag has arisen that would require referral for medical treatment. Follow-up is similar in format to a combination of both the assessment/triage phase and the education phase. Ideally, it’s best if the same person provides the follow-up, as this is the person with whom the patient has developed a relationship. Let the patient know you would like to call within a few days to ensure that the plan is working and that no problems have developed with the medication. Patients appreciate this and are often happy to arrange a time for you to call. In the scenario where a patient does not want follow-up, provide them with information on how to best contact you if any questions or concerns arise regarding the plan.

#### How



Examples of statements and questions that can be used at this stage are listed in Figure 3.

| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Slow down; resist the temptation to “download” information quickly, e.g., learn to pause when there are natural breaks in your sentences. This helps the patient digest the information and provides an opportunity for the person to speak if there is a question or another piece of information to provideSpeak loud enough so the patient can hear youSpeak in a friendly toneRaise and lower the pitch of your voice appropriately (lower at the end of sentences; lower if patient is hard of hearing)Use precise language, e.g., “with an 8-oz glass of water,” not “with plenty of water” or “1 hour before a meal,” not “on an empty stomach”Write information down when verbal explanation is not sufficient | Increase the rate of speech (tempting when you have a lot of information to provide)Speak so loudly that others in the pharmacy can also hear you (have another staff member tell you if your conversation was heard)Speak in a condescending or patronizing mannerSpeak in a monotonous voice pitch (boring)Raise your pitch at the end of a sentence (sounds like you are questioning yourself)Hand out printed written information without also providing a verbal review |


Use good communication skills. A major difference between follow-up interactions and assessment/triage and educational interactions is that this discussion often takes place over the telephone. Since neither you nor the patient will be able to read each other’s nonverbal cues, particular attention must be paid to clear verbal communication. Verbal skills are outlined in Table 7.

The nonverbal messages you send will confirm your real interest in and concern for the patient. They will also make it easier for both of you to hear each other. Techniques for optimizing nonverbal communication during telephone conversations are outlined in Table 8.

| Do: |
| --- |
| Start with a friendly greetingConfirm the patient’s identity (e.g., “I’m looking to speak with Mr. Smith” or “May I speak with Mr. Smith?”)Confirm that now is a good time for them to talkSpeak more slowly than you would face to faceEnunciate clearlyLet the patient know if you need to stop talking to write something down or pause to think Confirm that the patient can hear you if you use a speaker phone Hold the receiver an appropriate distance from your mouth so that your voice is not muffled or too soft |


| Do: | Do not: |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare for the callGive your full attention to the phone callSmile to help ensure your voice carries a friendly toneListen carefully to the tone of the patient’s voice and speech in order to determine concerns or misunderstandings | Put the patient on hold (unless necessary to find information for the patient)Allow interruptions Have background noise, e.g., voices, music, ringing telephonesLet conversation be overheard by other people |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart outlining a process for conducting a follow-up call with a patient. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Introduction:**
   - Begin by introducing yourself and ensuring you are recognized as the caller.
   - Ask for and greet the patient by name.
   - Example: “Hello Mr./Ms. ____, it’s Bob, the pharmacist at City Drugstore.”

2. **Explain Purpose of Follow-up:**
   - Clearly state the reason for the call.
   - Example: “We spoke on Thursday about your ______, and I’m calling to see if what I recommended for you has helped.” 
   - Note: Do not apologize for calling.

3. **Assess Response:**
   - Start with an open-ended question, e.g., “How has the medication worked for you?”
   - Check for problems, e.g., “Am I correct in thinking that you’ve had the cough for 2 weeks now and that the medication has not helped?”
   - Check for adverse effects, e.g., “Have you had any stomach upset with the medication?”

4. **Advise if Necessary:**
   - May need to review the treatment plan or suggest a referral to another healthcare practitioner.

5. **Close:**
   - Summarize the conversation.
   - Explain any necessary follow-up.
   - Arrange time and date of follow-up if necessary.
   - Ask if there are any further questions, then end graciously.
   - Allow the patient to hang up first.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to ensure effective communication and follow-up with patients.

#### Evaluate Yourself

We can all improve our communication skills. There are some easy ways to evaluate your effectiveness. Try audio or video recording some patient interactions (with permission of course). You may find that you sound different and say things that are different from what you thought you said. Look for nonverbal cues in others: What do you like? What do you dislike? Think about the nonverbal cues that you send. Have a student or colleague watch you interact with a patient and then give you some feedback. Think about the patient: Were they relaxed and open during your discussion? Did you check for patient understanding? How did you do?
