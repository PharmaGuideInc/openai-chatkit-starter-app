#### Introduction

Patients with diabetes may develop neuropathy and associated loss of protective sensation. As a result, they may develop a foot ulcer or traumatic wound that may be complicated by a severe, limb- or life-threatening infection.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Furthermore, impaired arterial blood supply from peripheral vascular disease in the patient with diabetes may impair healing of ulcers and infections. Treatment morbidity and sequelae, including foot deformity and amputation, may impair function and quality of life.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Consensus guidelines may assist clinicians to evaluate and treat diabetic foot problems.​[^[2]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Patients with diabetes should have regular foot screening (see Prevention of Diabetic Foot Infections and Figure 1). In the case of a suspected diabetic foot infection, appropriate investigations include:​[^[5]]​[^[6]]



Table 1 summarizes the differential diagnosis of diabetic foot infection.

| Differential Diagnosis | Characteristics | Most Likely Pathogen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infectious​[a] |  |  |
| Abscess | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance. MRI or ultrasonography may show a cavity. Pus may be aspirated from abscess cavity | Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA or MRSA) |
| Cellulitis | Erythema without raised borders, swelling, with or without fluctuance | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common) |
| Erysipelas | Erythema with raised borders, swelling, with or without fluctuance | Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) |
| Lymphangitis | Erythematous streaking following the distribution of the lymphatics, not raised | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common) |
| Macerated foot | Tissues are excessively moist and macerated from soaking the foot | Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be the predominant pathogen in conjunction with S. aureus and other Gram-positive microorganisms |
| Osteomyelitis | Palpation of bone at base of ulcer. Radiographic changes may be noted (periosteal elevation, bone destruction, sequestrum) but may be absent in the early stages | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is the most common pathogen, but other less virulent organisms may be pathogenic, e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci |
| Septic arthritis | Erythema, swelling, stiffness, fluctuance at joint, malalignment of foot distal to involved joint | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) is the most common pathogen |
| Septic foot | Necrotic, foul-smelling foot with extensive areas of nonviable tissue. Gas may be seen in the soft tissues | Polymicrobial process involving Gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria |
| Suppurative tenosynovitis | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance along tendon; pain with tendon motion. MRI or ultrasonography may show fluid in tendon sheath. Pus may be aspirated from tendon sheath | S. aureus (MSSA or MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (group A or B most common), but may be polymicrobial including Gram-negative bacteria |
| Systemic sepsis | Fever, chills, rigors, shock, changes in mental status, impaired glycemic control, blood cultures that may yield bacteria | Any organism arising from a foot infection |
| Noninfectious |  |  |
| Noninfected ulcer | Open wound without signs of infection | N/A |
| Charcot arthropathy | Erythema, swelling, increased warmth; erythema may decrease with elevation of foot. Radiographic changes of fracture, dislocation or articular destruction may be noted several weeks after onset | N/A |
| Crystalline arthropathy | Erythema, swelling, fluctuance and tenderness of joint. Joint fluid analysis may show crystals consistent with pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate) or gout (uric acid) | N/A |
| Fracture, dislocation | Erythema and swelling may be present. Radiographic findings of fracture or dislocation | N/A |
| Ischemia, gangrene | Discoloration (pale, dusky or black), dependent rubor, coldness to touch, prolonged or absent capillary refill, absent peripheral pulses; decreased ankle-brachial index, toe blood pressures and tissue oxygen level | N/A |

#### Therapeutic Choices

Optimal treatment of diabetic foot infections includes drainage and débridement, proper wound care to promote healing, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, surgery as indicated, and correction of metabolic irregularities (glucose control). Treatment choices are guided by the severity of infection.

*Note*: noninfected wounds *do not* need to be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics.​[^[11]]

Figure 2 outlines the recommended approach to a suspected diabetic foot infection.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

#### Surgery

There are various situations when surgical interventions are appropriate:​[^[1]]



#### Wound Care

Proper wound care is essential regardless of the presence of infection. Continue wound healing measures until the wound is healed even if infection is cleared. Débridement removes necrotic debris. Paring of calluses removes hyperkeratotic tissue, which could otherwise serve as an impediment to healing or, if excessive, could increase plantar pressure beneath the callus, and undermine and destroy the soft tissues.

There are many dressing choices; dressings that provide a moist environment for wound healing are the most desirable. Saline-moistened gauze or hydroactive gel dressings provide a moist wound healing environment and assist in débridement; however, there are limited data to support the use of any specific dressing,​[^[12]]​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] including those that are antimicrobial-based.​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]​[^[19]] If the wound is excessively moist and becoming macerated, a dressing such as a Hydrofiber or an alginate will absorb exudate; if the wound has necrotic debris at its base, a débriding dressing such as saline-moistened gauze may be beneficial. See Pressure Ulcers for a description of various dressings.

Pressure relief (offloading the wound) with orthoses (braces, removable walker boots or ankle/foot orthoses), crutches or casts may promote wound healing.​[^[20]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antimicrobial Therapy

There is a paucity of data to enable recommendation of one antimicrobial agent over another.​[^[2]]​[^[21]] 

Factors contributing to the choice of antimicrobial agents include:



Initial therapy is usually empiric and based on the severity of infection (see Table 2). Empiric therapy for early infections should target Staphylococcus aureus and the beta-hemolytic streptococci; however, use the local epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to guide decision-making about empiric therapy.​[^[23]]

Patients who present with well-established infections, including necrotic tissue or foul-smelling discharge, should receive empiric therapy that also targets Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens, particularly if the patient has been soaking the foot.​[^[2]] If necrotic tissue is present and/or deep infection such as an abscess is suspected or confirmed, arrange a surgical opinion because antimicrobial therapy alone is unlikely to resolve the situation.

Oral therapy is usually sufficient for patients with mild and localized infections.​[^[24]] In patients with more extensive infections, which may be associated with systemic manifestations, IV therapy is indicated.

Duration of antimicrobial therapy is usually guided by response to therapy. For superficial and limited infections, a 7- to 14-day course of oral antimicrobial agents may be sufficient. If the infection is slow to improve or if it recurs, evaluate for other problems such as undrained abscess, foreign body, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.

Treatment of osteomyelitis is more complex because of bone involvement, and surgery is considered in the decision-making process. Potentially beneficial treatment options include either a prolonged course of oral therapy lasting months, guided by clinical, laboratory (ESR, CRP) and plain radiographic follow-up evaluation, or a 6-week course of parenteral therapy.​[^[22]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]] Follow-up evaluation with clinical examination and radiography may indicate that the 6-week course of parenteral therapy is sufficient or that it should be extended or followed with a prolonged course of oral therapy. Regardless of the route of antimicrobial administration, if clinical improvement is not observed (resolution of erythema, edema, heat, draining sinus, coverage of bone with soft tissue) and there is persisting plain radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis without improvement, consult an infectious disease specialist and a surgeon knowledgeable in the treatment of the diabetic foot.

For additional information regarding acute osteomyelitis, see Acute Osteomyelitis.

| Infection Severity | Antimicrobial Agent​[a]​[b]​[c] |
| --- | --- |
| Localized infections:Neither limb- nor life-threateningUsually associated with cellulitis surrounding an ulcerPurulent debris may be present at the base of the ulcer Usual organisms: aerobic Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci)Frequently treated with outpatient oral antimicrobial therapy | **Amoxicillin** |
| More extensive infections:Includes more severe infections, including more extensive cellulitis, plantar abscess and deep space infectionsThe choice of oral vs. parenteral therapy should be guided by the extent of the infection and the patient’s overall clinical statusInitial antimicrobial therapy directed against staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes and common Enterobacteriaceae speciesEmpiric treatment targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa is generally unnecessary unless risk factors present, e.g., history of foot soaking, severe or chronic infectionPatients who are not toxic may be treated with débridement and oral antimicrobial therapyPatients who are ill or toxic despite moderate local signs are treated as having a severe infectionCharacteristics and treatment of severe infection:Limb- or life-threateningFrequently polymicrobialMRSA is suspected or confirmed to be presentImmediate hospitalization, early surgical débridement and parenteral antimicrobial therapy (until stable, followed by oral therapy) | **Amoxicillin** |
| **cefazolin** |  |
| **Linezolid** |  |
| Osteomyelitis:Treat with IV therapy or long-term oral antimicrobial therapy using agents that are well absorbed from the GI tract and have good distribution to bone and tissueSurgical débridement indicated to remove necrotic debris, abscess or sequestrumTherapy should be based on culture results whenever possibleIf MRSA is present or suspected, consider addition of vancomycin or linezolid | **Amoxicillin** |
| **Clindamycin** |  |
| **Linezolid** |  |

#### Prevention of Diabetic Foot Infections

Prevention of diabetic foot infections involves systemic and local factors:

Systemic interventions include glucose control and treatment of medical comorbidities, including smoking cessation. Individuals who smoke should be encouraged to stop smoking (see Tobacco Use Disorder: Smoking Cessation). Correcting glucose control may help prevent progression of diabetic complications, aid the resolution of any existing infection and promote wound healing.​[^[26]]

Local interventions include care of the feet and callus paring. Advise patients with diabetes who have peripheral neuropathy to inspect the feet and shoes daily, have a foot examination by a health-care provider at least 4 times per year, avoid walking barefoot and use appropriately fitted footwear with soft protective insoles.​[^[27]] Before bathing, verify water temperature with a nonaffected limb. Advise patients to have regular nail care (cutting nails straight across) and avoid the application of heat or chemicals to the feet.

To prevent infection, promote healing of noninfected ulcers (see Nonpharmacologic Choices: Wound Care). An open ulcer on the foot of a person with diabetes does *not* require antimicrobial treatment unless the ulcer is clinically infected (erythema; edema; purulent discharge; new or intensified pain; systemic signs such as fever, chills, rigors or dysglycemia).​[^[2]] In addition to contributing to the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance, the use of these agents for clinically noninfected wounds could lead to adverse outcomes such as allergic reactions, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridioides difficile–associated disease, taste perversion and painful peripheral neuropathy (associated with metronidazole).

Consult with a surgeon who has experience in foot and ankle surgery if corrective surgery for treatment of morphologic abnormalities is being considered.

Diabetic foot clinics may provide coordinated care for persons with diabetes and foot-related complications.
