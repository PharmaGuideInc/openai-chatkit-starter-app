CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. When the terms “women,” “men,” “female” and “male” are used in this chapter, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and that they are not inclusive of all patients. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care.

#### Pathophysiology

Dandruff (pityriasis simplex capitis) and seborrheic dermatitis (SD) are papulosquamous cutaneous disorders​[^[1]] that may be difficult to distinguish from one another. They both cause scaling, which is often associated with itching. Dandruff is a milder, noninflammatory form of SD and is limited to the scalp. SD is an inflammatory condition with erythematous and scaling eruptions primarily in “seborrheic areas,” those with high numbers of sebaceous glands—scalp, face and upper trunk.

Uncommon in childhood, dandruff usually begins in men and women between 10 and 20 years of age and affects up to 50% of individuals over 30 years of age.​[^[2]] It is primarily a cosmetic problem. Turnover rate of skin cells may be twice the normal rate. Malassezia yeasts are present in some cases and may play an inflammatory role. Although a relatively stable condition, it may be exacerbated by poor hygiene or a dry environment.

SD is found in about 1–5% of the general population, 30–33% of immunocompromised patients and up to 83% of individuals with HIV. It can affect those of any age but is most common in the first 3 months of life and between 30 and 50 years of age. A male predominance is seen at all ages, probably because androgens control sebaceous gland activity. In adults, it is a chronic condition, commonly manifested as scaling and erythema of the nasolabial folds, ranging in intensity from barely perceptible to marked, with a waxing and waning pattern throughout adulthood.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] It may be a cutaneous marker of HIV and AIDS, especially when severe, atypical or therapy-resistant.

Despite its frequency, considerable controversy exists regarding the pathogenesis of SD. Some postulate that it is a fungal disease caused by the lipophilic Malassezia yeasts, based on the observation of their presence in affected skin and the therapeutic response to antifungal agents. Others propose that Malassezia infection is secondary to a primary inflammatory dermatosis that results in increased cell turnover, scaling and inflammation in the epidermis (similar to psoriasis). It also has been traditionally considered to be a form of dermatitis because Malassezia is present in healthy skin, the pathogenic mycelial form of Malassezia yeasts is absent, and it has a chronic course. In addition, the lipase activity of Malassezia produces free fatty acids and reactive oxygen radicals, which have antibacterial activity that alters the normal skin flora, contributing to dermatitis. As a result of these theories, proposed treatments vary, ranging from topical antifungals to topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.​[^[4]]​[^[6]]

Other factors contribute to the uncertainty around the etiology of SD. Though sebaceous glands are more active at the times of life that SD presents (neonatal and postpubertal periods), there is no direct relationship between the amount or composition of sebum and the condition.​[^[7]] Hormonal factors have also been implicated. The occurrence of SD in the neonatal period and remission by 6–12 months suggests a response to maternal androgen stimulation; recurrence postpuberty is further evidence of a response to androgen stimulation.​[^[5]]

SD can negatively impact quality of life, and relapses may occur frequently.​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy

Dandruff:



Seborrheic dermatitis:



#### Patient Assessment

A systematic approach to the assessment of dandruff and SD consists of assessing a patient's signs, symptoms and history for the following:



Ensure further assessment if the diagnosis is in doubt, if there is sudden onset in a young patient (to rule out other conditions that may mimic SD such as cutaneous lymphoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis or to assess for HIV) or if the patient is not responding to treatment. Patients should also be appropriately assessed if the condition is widespread or generalized.​[^[5]]

#### Symptoms of Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis

Lesions of SD and dandruff are often asymptomatic with a mild clinical course. Variations in the intensity of episodes are common and may be precipitated by fatigue, stress or cold weather. Dandruff is usually asymptomatic, although itching may develop. In SD, pruritus varies, being common in scalp and ear canal involvement, and may be intense.

#### Signs of Dandruff

Dandruff results in increased shedding of small flakes of scale from an otherwise normal scalp showing minimal erythema with no or limited inflammation. The scales are silver-grey, in patches or diffuse, and may separate fully or become detached only after combing. It is usually symmetrical and absent in the bald area of male pattern baldness. There is no evidence of other skin disease on the scalp or elsewhere.​[^[2]]​[^[9]]​[^[10]] The characteristic scales are often confused with other scaling conditions of the scalp such as SD, tinea capitis and psoriasis.​[^[2]]

#### Signs of Seborrheic Dermatitis

SD is an inflammatory, erythematous, greasy, scaling eruption often confused with dandruff (see photo, Seborrheic Dermatitis). It is characterized by sharply demarcated yellow to brown, greasy or bran-like scaling patches and plaques. In adolescents and adults, SD typically affects symmetric areas of the skin rich in sebaceous glands, including hairy areas of the head (scalp, scalp margin, eyelashes and brows, beard and mustache). Other sites commonly affected include the nasolabial folds, forehead, outer ear canals and in the creases behind the ears (facial skin sites predisposed to SD are generally those with increased skin temperature).​[^[7]] SD of the torso may present in the area of the sternum and in body folds (under the breasts, underarms, navel, groin, anogenital area).​[^[5]] It begins in small patches, rapidly spreading, with diffuse fine scales that in lightly coloured skin can be white, off-white or yellow with no signs of acute dermatitis such as oozing or weeping.​[^[11]] Exudation may be seen in facial SD from time to time. In darkly coloured skin, SD may appear as scaly, hypopigmented macules and patches in typical areas of involvement. Arched or petal-shaped patches may be seen.​[^[12]] SD typically flares and resolves in a cyclic or seasonal fashion, often in response to stress.​[^[1]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a person's scalp and neck area. There are multiple small, red, raised lesions or bumps visible on the skin. These lesions are concentrated around the hairline and extend slightly onto the neck. The skin appears slightly inflamed, and the lesions are scattered but clustered in certain areas. The person is holding their hair back, possibly to reveal the affected area more clearly. This presentation could be indicative of a dermatological condition such as acne, folliculitis, or another type of rash. However, a medical professional should be consulted for an accurate diagnosis.

Profuse powdery scales of the eyebrows may compromise the wearing of contact lenses. The eyelids alone may be affected, developing honey-coloured crusting called blepharitis. There is erythema and scaling of anterior eyelid margins (eyelid edge closest to the eyelashes) and lashes often associated with mild granular conjunctivitis or ocular irritation. Involvement in other sites may not be present. Blepharitis may also be associated with ocular rosacea. See Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis and Rosacea.

Paranasal involvement is typically seen in young women who may not have dandruff. The most common type of facial SD in males is a follicular erythematous form involving the upper lip, beard, scalp, back, flanks and abdomen. Plaques may present with thick, adherent silvery scales (as seen with psoriasis), which usually spare the face, called sebopsoriasis.​[^[1]]

In infants of any skin tone, the entire scalp may be covered with thick, dry, adherent, yellowish-brown scales overlying erythema, often called “cradle cap.” It may also involve the central face, forehead and ears. A widespread erythema with cheesy exudate sometimes presents in the flexural folds, manifesting as diaper dermatitis in infants. This may generalize (spread to other parts of the body).​[^[11]] In addition, cradle cap may present as red/purple, inflamed, flaking and hypopigmented skin in children with darkly pigmented skin.​[^[12]] Cradle cap is self-limiting, appears in the first to fourth week of life and usually disappears after the first 3 months.

In chronic cases, nonscarring alopecia may occur secondary to inflammation and scratching. This alopecia should be reversible with treatment.​[^[7]]

Scalp SD must be distinguished from dandruff and psoriasis (see Table 2 and Table 3) as well as tinea capitis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, systemic lupus erythematosus and fungal skin infections. Refer patients for further assessment when there is diagnostic uncertainty (to consider other diagnoses) or failure to respond to first-line treatment after 4 weeks (possible secondary changes, e.g., bacterial infection, flexural intertrigo, lichenification, otitis externa or severe/widespread disease).​[^[13]]

#### Seborrheic Dermatitis: Risk and Aggravating Factors



#### Drug-Induced Seborrheic Dermatitis

A number of drugs have been associated with causing or aggravating SD (see Table 1). When deciding whether to discontinue the offending agent, consider individual circumstances such as the severity of the SD, the need for the drug and the availability of alternative medications.

|  |  |  |

Dandruff and SD are often confused with psoriasis, especially when present on the scalp. Table 3 clarifies the differences among the 3 conditions.

| Feature | Dandruff | Seborrheic Dermatitis | Psoriasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lesions | On nonerythematous base with fine, diffuse scales | Erythema with mild greasy yellow scales, plaques with indistinct margins | Annular well-demarcated silvery, scaly plaques, with erythematous base; bleed easily |
| Common sites | Scalp | Central face, scalp, mid-chest | Scalp, elbows, knees, sacrum |
| Palms and soles | No | No | Common |
| Nails | No | No | Pitting, thickening, dystrophy |
| Hair and scalp | Yes | Yes; hair may thin | Thick scales common |
| Intertrigo (skin fold involvement) | No | Inverse type, glans penis, mostly infants | Common |
| Pruritus | Due to dryness | Varies; more common with involvement of scalp or ear canal | Sometimes |
| Associated systemic symptoms | None | May generalize in infants; worse in patients with HIV infection | May generalize; psoriatic arthritis |


#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

#### Infantile Seborrheic Dermatitis

Because infantile SD (cradle cap) is benign and self-limiting, a conservative approach should be taken. Evidence to support any intervention is limited and of low quality;​[^[22]] however, management recommendations include:



Dietary avoidance or vitamin supplementation have not been shown to be effective.

#### Dandruff and Adult Seborrheic Dermatitis

The following nonpharmacologic measures may be helpful in the management of dandruff and/or adult SD:



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Acne, Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis, and Dermatitis and Dry Skin.

Pharmacological treatment of dandruff and SD generally consists of three classes of medications: antifungal agents, anti-inflammatory agents and keratolytics. Moisturizers play an ancillary role for softening of scale. Topical therapies are recommended first with oral treatments reserved for severe cases or when the disease involves multiple body regions or is recalcitrant to topical therapy. Effective treatment often requires combination therapy with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options.

#### Application of Medicated Shampoos

Many of the therapies for SD discussed in this section come in shampoo formulations (see Table 5). To ensure adherence, the shampoo has to be both effective and cosmetically appealing.

To ensure effectiveness, correct application is critical. The shampoo must be massaged into the scalp for 4–5 minutes, rinsed thoroughly and repeated. Instruct patients to part their hair in small sections, and apply and massage the medicated shampoo or scalp treatment into the scalp at the hair roots. This should be repeated until the entire scalp has been treated. Medicated therapies should be left in contact with the scalp or beard for 2–20 minutes depending on the product. For more severe cases, therapies can be left on overnight under a shower cap to allow the treatment to interact with the skin of the scalp. Moisturizing, nonmedicated shampoos or conditioners can be used afterward to prevent desiccation of the hair. Shampoos may be used on the scalp, beard and chest but may cause the disease to flare if used on the face or other intertriginous areas for extended periods.​[^[5]]

#### Moisturizers

Moisturizers (particularly those with occlusive or emollient properties, e.g., mineral oil or surfactant-containing bath oils), are considered helpful for softening scales in cradle cap, though evidence to support this is limited and of low quality.​[^[22]] In adolescents or adults with SD of the scalp, these products may also be used to loosen or remove dense scale prior to using a medicated shampoo by applying them to the scalp for several hours or overnight and then rinsing.​[^[5]]

#### Antifungals

Antifungal agents that decrease colonization by lipophilic yeasts (Malassezia species) are effective in the treatment of dandruff and SD and are generally considered first-line therapy in both conditions. SD in adults tends to be chronic and recurrent: treatment is directed toward control rather than cure. SD tends to relapse after 2–3 weeks if treatments are not carried out repetitively. This reflects the slow proliferation rate of *Malassezia*. Shampoos are used if scalp is affected and creams or lotions are used for face, ears and trunk. Treatment effect of antifungals on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better study design, outcome measures and reporting are needed to improve the evidence base for antifungal treatment of SD.​[^[28]] Very few studies of antifungals have assessed symptom clearance for longer than 4 weeks.

Systematic reviews have confirmed the effectiveness of ketoconazole for control of SD.​[^[8]]​[^[28]] At therapeutic concentrations, ketoconazole is fungistatic​[^[29]] and can mediate inflammation through inhibtion of leukotriene production.​[^[8]] As a cytostatic, it also slows cell turnover.​[^[24]] Approximately 80% of patients show good response within 4 weeks. However, recurrence consistently occurs within 2–4 weeks of stopping treatment.​[^[8]] Topical ketoconazole is well tolerated: adverse effects have been reported to be similar to placebo.​[^[28]] Long-term safety is favourable with chronic use, and efficacy is maintained. ​[^[30]] Other azole antifungals such as clotrimazole or miconazole may also be effective; however, evidence is limited and ketoconazole is preferred.​[^[28]]

Ciclopirox **olamine** has demonstrated similar safety and efficacy to ketoconazole in systematic reviews.​[^[8]]​[^[28]] One systematic review found patients preferred ciclopirox over ketoconazole based on tolerance and handling.​[^[8]]

Selenium sulfide is fungicidal against numerous strains of *Malassezia*​[^[31]] and may have fungistatic action on the scalp.​[^[32]] It is classified as a keratolytic by the FDA and slows scale production and epidermal proliferation.​[^[32]] Although dandruff or mild cases of scalp SD may be controlled with selenium sulfide alone or in combination with other topical therapy, there is limited evidence of efficacy available and it is associated with more side effects (burning and itching of scalp) than ketoconazole or ciclopirox, making it an alternative option when other treatments are ineffective.​[^[33]]

Zinc pyrithione has a somewhat similar mechanism of action to selenium sulfide. It has cytostatic properties and is classified as keratolytic, but it also affects membrane transport, macromolecular synthesis, cell structure and function.​[^[34]] It has a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi including *Malassezia*.​[^[35]] Zinc pyrithione shampoo has been shown to return stratum corneum ultrastructure to normal, suggesting it can control dandruff.​[^[36]] Clinical evidence of efficacy is limited and of low quality.​[^[33]] Although it may be effective alone (or in combination with other topical therapy) for mild cases of dandruff or scalp SD, it is not recommended as a first-line agent when the condition is more severe.

Many other topical antifungals have been used with varying success. These include clotrimazole, fluconazole, miconazole and itraconazole.​[^[28]]

Oral  antifungals are reserved for severe or refractory cases due to increased risk of side effects and drug interactions. Various medications have been studied including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and terbinafine. Ketoconazole therapy was associated with more relapses compared with other treatments in one systematic review.​[^[37]] Pulsed dosing of itraconazole (200 mg/day for 2 consecutive days/month) showed significantly higher efficacy and lower recurrence rates over 4 months compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe SD.​[^[38]] Other evidence is generally of low quality, and reported clinical efficacy varies considerably among studies.

#### Anti-inflammatory Agents

Systematic reviews have found topical  corticosteroids to be effective for decreasing the symptoms of SD,​[^[8]]​[^[39]] as they reduce pruritus and inflammation. They may be added to antifungal treatment if the response is not adequate or the lesions are extensive or severe. Topical corticosteroids are intended for temporary use. They should be discontinued when itching and erythema resolve, and maintenance therapy with antifungals should then be adequate.​[^[5]] Low-potency corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 1% should be used on the face or folds. Stronger topical corticosteroids may be used on other body areas if the response to hydrocortisone is insufficient. Severe and thick scales on the scalp can respond to overnight application of topical corticosteroids followed by shower cap occlusion. Long-term use of potent agents is discouraged for controlling SD, as relapse rates are often high​[^[40]] and their use may lead to undesirable side effects such as atrophy, telangiectasia, poor wound healing, perioral dermatitis and pustular acne. The form of topical corticosteroid selected is determined by the patient and the treatment site. Ointments, due to their occlusive nature, are preferred for use on areas that are resistant to absorption or are dry or scaly. Avoid ointments if acne is present. Creams are used in moist areas due to their drying effect, while lotions and solutions are best for the scalp and hairy areas or for large areas that require a minimal application. The potency of the same corticosteroid is affected by the vehicle: ointment>cream>lotion.​[^[5]] For more information on the effect of vehicles, see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis. In severe cases, keratolytics such as salicylic acid or coal tar preparations may be used to remove dense scales before applying topical corticosteroids.

Although topical corticosteroids are generally not recommended for use on the thin skin of the eyelids, ophthalmic topical corticosteroid ointments are sometimes recommended for application to the affected lid margins or conjunctiva in cases of severe inflammation or complications due to blepharitis associated with SD. See Eyelid Conditions: Hordeolum, Chalazion and Blepharitis.

**Topical** calcineurin inhibitors are immunomodulators used in the treatment of SD and may be alternatives when topical corticosteroids are not tolerated or inappropriate (e.g., for use on the eyelids). Tacrolimus prevents the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and pimecrolimus suppresses their production. Tacrolimus has also demonstrated antifungal properties. These agents have efficacy comparable to standard antifungal and topical corticosteroid treatments in decreasing severity of clinical symptoms and signs associated with SD.​[^[8]]​[^[39]]​[^[41]] Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream lack the side effects associated with corticosteroid use and require significantly fewer applications to achieve comparable clinical response in adults with facial SD.​[^[42]] They have also been used in combination with topical corticosteroids.​[^[43]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]]​[^[46]] There is some evidence that intermittent (e.g., twice-weekly) use may maintain remission in facial SD.​[^[47]] Topical tacrolimus used together with zinc pyrithione may be an alternative to topical corticosteroids in treating scalp SD.​[^[48]] Concerns of a link between use of topical calcineurin inhibitors and malignancy have not been substantiated by available evidence.​[^[49]]

Topical tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are used in the treatment of seborrheic blepharitis, as use of topical corticosteroids on the thin skin of the eyelids is usually avoided due to increased risk of absorption and side effects. Use of topical calcineurin inhibitors on the eyelids has an established long-term safety profile. Tacrolimus ointment was more effective and better tolerated than pimecrolimus cream in one study. Additional studies are needed to address the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitors compared with topical corticosteroids when used on the eyelids.​[^[50]]

#### Keratolytic Agents

Keratolytics loosen bonds between keratinocytes in the skin, which helps detach flakes and increase penetration of other topical medications, which can improve their effectiveness.​[^[1]]​[^[9]]​[^[36]] For this reason, keratolytics may be added onto other topical therapy if the response has been inadequate, though clinical evidence to support their use is limited.

Salicylic acid and sulfur are mildly effective because of their keratolytic and antiseptic activities, but have minimal proven antifungal activity. They are used alone or combined with other active ingredients. Products containing salicylic acid *and* sulfur are more potent, but are proportionally more irritating; therefore, proper use is important​[^[32]] (see Table 5).

The keratolytic and antiseptic properties of coal tar make it mildly effective for SD because it reduces local swelling and inflammation and relieves itching. Because it works by reducing cell proliferation, it requires time to lengthen cell differentiation and normalize epidermal differentiation, resulting in a slow decline in visible scales.​[^[26]] It has minimal antifungal activity, making it a poor alternative to anti-Malassezia agents.​[^[9]] Evidence of effectiveness has been reported in one randomized controlled trial (RCT); ​[^[51]] however, it is not widely used due to odour, staining and concerns about side effects (see Table 5), including possible carcinogenicity​[^[52]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]] and reduced effectiveness compared to other agents.

#### Other Treatments

Many other alternative treatments have been used for severe or refractory cases or as novel approaches. Some of these are noted below.

Topical metronidazole has been studied versus placebo or antifungals with mixed results.​[^[8]]​[^[55]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]]

Sodium sulfacetamide 10% lotion alone or in combination with a topical corticosteroid has been used in the treatment of SD, including seborrheic blepharitis. There are no comparative trials for the use of this agent.​[^[10]]

Lithium (gluconate and succinate) topical products were reported as being consistently effective across high-quality trials in a systematic review,​[^[8]] with side effects found to be similar in nature and incidence to azole antifungals. Systemic absorption of topical lithium is low.​[^[59]]​[^[60]] Topical lithium products are not commercially available in Canada but can be compounded. Topical lithium can be considered for recalcitrant cases.

Low-dose systemic isotretinoin has been used by some specialists in severe refractory cases of SD based on limited evidence.​[^[61]]

Antiandrogen therapy (e.g., spironolactone, flutamide, cyproterone) has been used in practice to treat SD in women with hyperandrogen syndromes.​[^[62]]

**Ultraviolet light** inhibits Malassezia yeasts. Many patients note improvement during the summer months. UVB phototherapy has been shown to be effective in severe SD;​[^[63]]​[^[64]] however, some patients have developed SD subsequent to psoralens UVA (PUVA) therapy.​[^[7]]​[^[65]] Phototherapy may be ineffective if patients have thick hair.

Other therapies such as nicotinamide 4% cream,​[^[66]] a shampoo containing lipohydroxy acid and salicylic acid,​[^[67]] and a solution containing urea, lactic acid and propylene glycol​[^[68]] have shown some efficacy in small preliminary studies.

#### Comparative Efficacy

 Evidence comparing the efficacy of various treatments is not of high quality; however, overall, antifungals (particularly ketoconazole and ciclopirox olamine) seem to produce better or equal clinical responses in the treatment of SD in the short term compared with other agents and have a specific action against Malassezia. From highest to lowest, efficacy of these compounds’ treatments can be ranked as: 1) ketoconazole, ciclopirox or moderate-potency corticosteroids; 2) hydrocortisone or calcineurin inhibitors; 3) selenium sulfide; 4) zinc pyrithione; 5) keratolytics; and 6) coal tar.​[^[9]] Antifungals can be used long term without decreased response, whereas topical corticosteroids must be used intermittently in combination with other agents. Calcineurin inhibitors can also be used intermittently alone or in combination with other agents for maintenance.

Figure 1 provides a suggested approach for the treatment of dandruff and SD of the scalp. Figure 2 provides a suggested approach for the treatment of nonscalp SD. See Table 5 for information on therapies for dandruff and SD.

#### Natural Health Products

Evidence showing that natural health products and homeopathic products are efficacious is limited. Further, the use of herbal preparations that are nonstandardized should be discouraged in favour of traditional quality-controlled preparations.​[^[69]]

Quassia amara gel comes from a South American shrub and has antimicrobial and antifungal properties. A 4% gel has been compared with topical ketoconazole 2% and topical ciclopirox olamine 1% for facial SD with significant advantage in efficacy after 4 weeks.​[^[70]]

Tea tree oil (*Melaleuca alternifolia*) is an extract from leaves of the tea tree plant. It has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antifungal activity including some in vitro activity against M. furfur, attributed to the presence of terpinen-4-ol. Solutions of 5–10% are used as external antifungals.​[^[71]] Small, placebo-controlled studies have found tea tree oil 5% to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of dandruff​[^[72]] and facial SD.​[^[73]]

Aloe vera extract contains immunomodulatory factors that affect the production of interleukin-10.​[^[74]] One RCT found a 30 % emulsion applied twice daily improved facial SD with no significant adverse effects reported.​[^[75]]

Leaf extract of the plant ***Solanum chrysotrichum*** possesses biologic activity against dermatophytes and yeast. Various steroidal saponins with antimycotic activity have been isolated from the active extract. Therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of the standardized extract from *S. chrysotrichum* for local treatment of pityriasis capitis associated with the yeast *Malassezia* showed a mycological cure rate of 69%, which was not significantly different from ketoconazole 2% in a small RCT.​[^[76]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 4 presents a monitoring framework for patients with dandruff and SD. The parameters should be monitored by the patient in a diary. Scales will improve quite quickly with cosmetic treatment and hygiene control; thickness of scales will improve more slowly and erythema will take longest to respond.

The side effects of drug therapy should also be monitored. Discontinue therapy if allergic reactions occur. If the condition worsens due to irritation, alter therapy. Failure to meet the end points should result in alteration of dosage or drug therapy. Therapy should be appropriately tapered in response to improvement or resolution.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart detailing the management of a skin condition, likely seborrheic dermatitis, with specific instructions for basic measures, initial therapy, and further treatment options. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Basic Measures
- **Avoid**: Harsh soaps, detergents, alcohol-containing products.
- **Use**: Warm water for bathing, remove scales daily.
- **Moisturize**: Daily with nonsensitizing emollients.
- **If ineffective**: Proceed to initial therapy.

### Initial Therapy
- **Topical Antifungal**: 
  - Options: Ketoconazole daily or ciclopirox BID for 4 weeks, or ruxolitinib foam once daily for up to 8 weeks.
- **Add Topical Corticosteroid**: 
  - Hydrocortisone BID-TID if extensive or severe.
  - Discontinue when erythema and itch resolve or after 2 weeks maximum.
- **If ineffective**: Trial of the other antifungal option (ketoconazole or ciclopirox) and add topical corticosteroid if not already used.

### Eyelid Care (if affected)
- **Regular Hygiene**: 
  - 2–3 times daily initially, taper to twice weekly once control achieved.
  - **Warm Compresses**: To closed eyelids for 5–10 minutes.
  - **Scrub Eyelid Margin**: With warm water or diluted baby shampoo on a facecloth or cotton swab, or with commercial lid wipe.
- **If ineffective**: Refer to ophthalmologist for further consideration.

### Further Treatment Options
- **If initial therapy is effective**: 
  - Taper therapy to maintain control.
  - Decrease antifungal to twice weekly.
  - If flares develop, resume daily use of antifungal with intermittent topical corticosteroid as for initial therapy.

### Calcineurin Inhibitors
- **Options**: Pimecrolimus, tacrolimus.
- **If effective**: Taper to maintain control, decrease to intermittent interval dosing.
- **If ineffective**: Refer to specialist care for other treatments (e.g., more potent topical corticosteroids, topical lithium, UV light therapy, systemic therapy).

### Additional Notes
- **Eyelid Care**: If ineffective, consider contact dermatitis related to baby shampoo or commercial lid cleansing products, treatment of infectious complications, or severe inflammation with topical calcineurin inhibitors or ophthalmic corticosteroid ointment.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing the condition, with clear steps for escalation and specialist referral if standard treatments are ineffective.
