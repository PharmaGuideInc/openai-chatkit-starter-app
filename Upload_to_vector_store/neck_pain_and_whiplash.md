#### Introduction

Neck pain is one of the most common conditions seen in primary practice,​[^[1]] and is one of the chief presenting symptoms of whiplash resulting from motor vehicle collisions. Whiplash is defined as a hyperextension-hyperflexion mechanism of energy transfer to the neck, which may cause bone or soft-tissue injuries.​[^[2]] This chapter discusses the nonsurgical management of acute neck pain, including the common presentation of whiplash, in addition to the management of general subacute and chronic neck pain.

#### Goals of Therapy

**Acute Phase (1–7 days)**



**Acute Phase (1–4 weeks)**



**Subacute Period (4–12 weeks)**



**Chronic Pain (6 months or more)**



#### Investigations

#### Initial Assessment

The Clinically Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) neck tool (see Figure 1) has been developed to guide clinicians through the assessment and management of patients with neck pain and to triage patients to appropriate specialist intervention when needed.

When neurologic injury or cervical spine injury is a concern, refer to the Canadian C-Spine rules (see Figure 3) and seek expert guidance.

If the pain is acute (1–7 days) classify according to Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD) criteria (see Table 2, Figure 2)​[^[2]] or according to Bone and Joint Decade 2000–2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders (see Table 3).​[^[3]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical questionnaire designed to assess neck pain and its potential causes. It consists of a series of questions with decision points and recommendations based on the responses. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Pain Location:**
   - **Question:** Where is your pain worst?
     - **Options:**
       - Arm (includes shoulder, deltoid, upper arm, forearm, hand, and often neck area)
       - Neck (includes suboccipital, trapezius, parascapular, shoulder paraspinal, may include intermittent arm pain)

2. **Pain Consistency:**
   - **Question:** Is your pain constant or intermittent?
     - **Options:**
       - Constant → Rule out red flags (see Table 1)
       - Intermittent

3. **Associated Symptoms:**
   - **Question:** Have you experienced unexplained chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath during this episode of neck pain?
     - **Options:**
       - No
       - Yes → Consider cardiac etiology (including history, physical, and appropriate investigation)

4. **Neurological Symptoms:**
   - **Question:** Have you noticed any of the following symptoms since the onset of your neck pain?
     - **Options:**
       - Changes in walking (gait), clumsiness, or imbalance
       - Difficulty with fine motor tasks (e.g., doing up a clasp or small buttons)
       - New onset tingling or numbness in arms or hands
     - **If yes to any:** Surgical evaluation recommended to rule out degenerative cervical myelopathy and determine treatment and monitoring regime

5. **Trauma History:**
   - **Question:** Did your neck pain begin with a trauma, accident, or fall?
     - **Options:**
       - No
       - Yes → Consider Canadian C-spine rules (see Figure 3)

6. **Age-Related Symptoms:**
   - **Question:** If you are 60 years old or younger, are you experiencing prolonged morning stiffness in your neck for longer than 30 minutes?
     - **Options:**
       - No
       - Yes → Consider inflammatory etiology (refer for rheumatology consult)

7. **Functional Limitations:**
   - **Question:** Is there anything you cannot do now that you could do before the onset of your pain?
     - **Options:**
       - No
       - Yes → Rule out yellow flags (see Table 4)
       - What has changed? Why?

This questionnaire is structured to guide the clinician in identifying potential underlying causes of neck pain and determining appropriate next steps for evaluation and management.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| WAD-I | neck pain, stiffness or tenderness, but no physical signs/limitations |
| WAD-II | pain and tenderness and reduced range |
| WAD-III | pain and neurologic signs; sensory or motor or reflex changes without fracture/instability |
| WAD-IV | fracture or dislocation |


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Grade I | neck pain/associated disorders without indication of major structural pathology, and either minor interference or no interference with activities of daily living (ADL) |
| Grade II | no indication of major pathology, but major interference with ADL |
| Grade III | no indication of major pathology, but having neurologic signs (abnormal reflexes, weakness, sensory deficits) |
| Grade IV | signs/symptoms of major structural pathology (may include fracture, vertebral dislocation, spinal cord injury, infection, neoplasm, systemic inflammatory disease) |


If the patient is not making progress in function or is suffering from unexpected prolongation of pain (>4 weeks), re-evaluate to identify yellow flags (see Table 4) that may impair progress. Unexplained high-intensity pain and loss of function, catastrophizing and post-traumatic stress are strong predictors of poor outcomes and chronicity.​[^[5]] Depression, anxiety and passive coping strategies may also be risk factors for poor outcomes.​[^[5]]

#### Physical Examination

The following physical exams are recommended:​[^[4]]



#### Diagnostic Imaging

Decision to x-ray is based on presence of red flags (see Table 1). However, neurologic findings may not be present or prominent with cervical fracture, so clinical judgment/experience and imaging are necessary when fracture is suspected.​[^[2]]

Order plain radiographs for neck pain lasting more than a few weeks, or more detailed studies if there is nerve root or spinal cord involvement or history of such injury.​[^[10]]

#### Neck Pain: Acute Phase (1–30 Days)

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Scientific evidence regarding initial management of neck pain and whiplash is limited and of poor quality.​[^[11]]

Patients with WAD-IV (Bone and Joint Decade classification Grade IV): refer urgently for surgical management.​[^[2]]​[^[12]]

WAD-I to WAD-III (Bone and Joint Decade classification Grades I–III): provide symptomatic relief as indicated, and reassure and counsel to resume normal activity as soon as possible. Avoid immobilization or passive therapy, except in the case of acute cervical radiculopathy.​[^[2]] 

Patient education combined with urgent care improves acute whiplash outcome. However, educational interventions by themselves (advice to stay active, neck school, relaxation) have demonstrated only very weak efficacy in pain relief or functional improvement.​[^[13]] Collars and high health-care utilization may be associated with delayed recovery.​[^[14]]

There is considerable agreement among experts that patients should be advised to return to usual activity as soon as tolerated and avoid collars, with the possible exception of briefly using a collar (3–6 weeks) for acute cervical radiculopathy (WAD-II or Bone and Joint Decade classification Grade III),​[^[12]] bed rest or immobilization, and limiting or avoiding work absence.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] Additionally, there’s some evidence that a return to work may help solidify gains made in therapy; therefore, discussion and formulation of a collaborative return to work plan (where applicable) is suggested.​[^[17]]

Stretching and strengthening exercise programs that concentrate on the musculature of the cervical area, shoulder-thoracic area or both may be beneficial in acute mechanical neck disorders.​[^[18]]

If progress is not occurring as expected by the end of the 1​[^st] month, consider the possibility of psychosocial barriers or complications. Active exercise combined with psychosocial intervention results in reduced pain in the short term and accelerates return to work.​[^[2]] However, early multidisciplinary treatment (<4 weeks postinjury) has not been shown to be more effective than usual care.​[^[19]] For the early management of whiplash disorder based on the WAD classification, see Figure 2.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic options to treat neck pain and whiplash are presented in Low Back Pain, Table 3.

There is evidence that acetaminophen is not effective for reducing pain intensity and disability or improving quality of life in the short term in spinal pain.​[^[20]] While NSAIDs are more effective for symptom relief than placebo during the 1​[^st] month of back pain,​[^[21]] there is a paucity of studies to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in acute neck pain and whiplash, even though in practice they are often recommended.​[^[22]] In back pain studies, there is no evidence that any one NSAID is more effective for reducing pain.​[^[21]] Consider individual patient contraindications and the risks associated with use of NSAIDs, such as history of GI or cardiovascular disease. 

Muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, tizanidine, orphenadrine) can be used during the acute phase of neck pain. 

Tramadol or codeine are appropriate alternatives. Any prescription of opioid (or synthetic opioids) should be according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines for opioid therapy,​[^[23]] and should likely not precede treatment with anti-inflammatories or other atypical pain relievers.   

A single high-quality study reported that IV methylprednisolone for acute whiplash of less than 8 hours' duration led to reduced pain at 1 week and reduced sick leave but not pain at 6 months.​[^[24]] Risks of high-dose corticosteroid therapy include immunosuppression and pulmonary infection.​[^[25]] This treatment option is not recommended until further studies become available.

#### Neck Pain: Subacute Period (4–12 Weeks)

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Although there is a lack of quality evidence for the efficacy of treatment with only passive and palliative physical therapy modalities or medications for symptom relief, they may be used in conjunction with active measures to promote patient comfort and adherence to the active treatments. There is weak evidence that advice and exercise is better than advice alone in the short term for subacute whiplash symptoms.​[^[14]] Similarly, combining exercise with passive therapies may be beneficial. For example, combining psychoeducation with a few sessions of active physiotherapy is effective for reducing disability in the subacute period.​[^[26]] 

There is evidence of efficacy of **exercise** over passive therapy. There is limited evidence for taking breaks during sedentary work. Moderate-quality evidence shows moderate pain relief and improved function for combined cervical, scapulothoracic stretching and strengthening for neck pain.​[^[18]] Patients may feel more benefit from such therapies. 

There is limited and low-quality evidence for **manual therapy** for subacute and chronic neck pain.​[^[2]]​[^[27]] The role of manual therapies, e.g., manipulation or mobilization of the spine, is still controversial, partly due to a very small but real risk of vertebrobasilar stroke after manipulation.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Manipulation or mobilization should be performed only by an expert therapist with certified skills in manual therapy and with appropriate clinical screening to exclude patients with risk factors for complications. 

 There is evidence for **massage** added to manual therapy,​[^[14]] but evidence for massage alone is of poor quality.​[^[30]]

Cognitive behavioural therapy (**CBT**) may provide short-term pain relief for patients with subacute neck pain; however, there is no evidence of benefit on disability or kinesiophobia.​[^[31]] 

There is inconsistent evidence that **acupuncture** is associated with better short- and long-term outcome in subacute or chronic neck pain, compared with sham acupuncture or massage.​[^[14]] Weak and limited evidence exists that magnetic therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is more effective in the short term than alternatives.​[^[39]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Pharmacologic options to treat neck pain and whiplash are presented in Low Back Pain, Table 3.

There is weak and contradictory evidence for efficacy of NSAIDs for subacute neck pain.​[^[14]]​[^[22]]

There is limited evidence supporting efficacy of muscle relaxants in subacute and chronic neck disorders.​[^[14]]​[^[22]] In the absence of controlled studies, expert opinion is that if patients complain of a high level of pain/tenderness in more than 1 area, muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, tizanidine, orphenadrine, methocarbamol), **tricyclic antidepressants**, GABA derivatives (gabapentin, pregabalin) or tramadol may be effective. When pain is severe and not responsive to other appropriate measures, opioids may be considered, beginning with low doses and for a period of 3–5 days before review.​[^[23]]

There is some evidence for intramuscular injection of lidocaine (block of trigger points) combined with stretching exercise for neck pain in the acute injury and in the subacute phase.​[^[22]] 

#### Neck Pain: 3 Months

#### Functional Assessment

If functional improvement and return to work/activity have not happened by this point, there is an increased risk of chronic pain and poor function. Identify psychosocial and related risk factors that may impair progress. If work return (with or without modifications) is not successful, refer to multidisciplinary rehabilitation, in liaison with stakeholders, with the goal of return to work and function.

#### Chronic Neck Pain (≥6 Months)

#### Therapeutic Choices

With time there is increasing probability of associated psychological comorbidity.​[^[6]] Assess and treat comorbid depression, anxiety or adjustment problems. Refer to an appropriate specialist if indicated.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

In chronic pain, individual supervised active **exercises** (but not group exercise classes) can improve pain and function.​[^[32]]​[^[33]] There is a lack of evidence that one supervised exercise program is superior to another.

In patients with chronic neck pain, **CBT** did not result in clinically meaningful benefits.​[^[31]]

For chronic musculoskeletal pain in general, there is limited evidence that intensive multimodal/multidisciplinary treatment programs (CBT with active exercise and psychosocial intervention, programs that include or simulate real-life work activities [work hardening] and planning for work re-entry) are effective for improving function and sense of well-being.​[^[34]] The active ingredient in successful work return, however, appears to be timely *workplace intervention* including all the stakeholders rather than clinic treatment modalities.​[^[34]]​[^[35]] 

Expert opinion is that multidisciplinary pain management should be recommended for chronic pain with impaired function and failure to improve or failure of work return. Evidence from the few available poor-quality studies is insufficient to estimate the efficacy of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial therapy for neck and shoulder pain.​[^[36]] The Bone and Joint Decade 2000–2010 Task Force found 1 nonrandomized study showing that multidisciplinary management of post-WAD pain was associated with quicker claim closure compared with usual care.​[^[14]] Another study did not find quicker recovery with referrals to fitness training, inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation plus usual care.​[^[14]] 

Weak and limited evidence exist that acupuncture,​[^[37]] dry needling,​[^[38]] magnetic therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),​[^[39]] and traction therapy​[^[40]] are beneficial for chronic mechanical neck pain; however, more research is required before recommending such interventions.

#### Surgical Options

For neck pain with radicular symptoms, relatively rapid and substantial relief of pain and impairment is noted following surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy in the 6–12 weeks after surgery, but there is absence of evidence for long-term outcomes. Anterior cervical plating seems to reduce kyphosis progression. It is not clear that complex open procedures including fusion, cage or plate instrumentation, or fusion augmentation with bone morphogenic protein, provide superior outcomes versus simple cervical decompression alone. Limited evidence suggests possible favourable outcomes with cervical disk arthroplasty for radicular symptoms, but long-term safety is unknown.​[^[41]] 

Anterior cervical fusion or cervical disk arthroplasty for neck pain without radiculopathy or serious underlying pathology is not supported by evidence.​[^[41]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

With respect to subacute widespread pain and tenderness, expert opinion is that **muscle relaxants**, GABA derivatives (gabapentin, pregabalin) and tramadol may be effective. There is limited published evidence that orphenadrine and acetaminophen are associated with greater pain reduction in the short term (8 days) in patients with subacute or chronic neck pain. There is weak and contradictory evidence for efficacy of NSAIDs for chronic neck pain.​[^[14]]​[^[22]]

There is limited clinical trial evidence for the efficacy of opioids for chronic pain,​[^[21]] but there is expert acceptance of the use of opioids as one option. The 2017 Canadian guidelines for opioid therapy and chronic noncancer pain should be considered in treatment of all chronic noncancer pain including neck pain (i.e., pain lasting greater than 3 months and not associated with malignant disease).​[^[23]] It is recommended to optimize nonopioid pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacologic therapy first, rather than a trial of opioids.  Patient risk factors for potential substance abuse (e.g., past substance use disorder or psychiatric disorders) must be considered when a trial of opioids may be indicated, or alternatively avoidance of opioids may be in order.​[^[23]]

Although amitriptyline is widely used for soft tissue pain, neuralgia, headache and depression, **tricyclic antidepressants** have not been proven effective for mixed musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain relief.​[^[34]] Nevertheless, chronic pain is often associated with comorbidities. When major depression or anxiety disorders are comorbid with chronic pain, psychotropic medications may be an ingredient in proper treatment, though the pain itself will not necessarily be improved. For more information on the pharmacologic options to treat neck pain and whiplash, see Low Back Pain, Table 3.

#### Interventional Options

Though it is becoming widely used for persistent pain, there is evidence that onabotulinumtoxinA is not beneficial for pain and disability outcomes for subacute or chronic neck pain, compared with other treatments.​[^[22]]​[^[42]]

Several low-quality studies suggest that local infiltration of anesthetic into hyperalgesic soft-tissue (trigger/tender points) may afford short-term relief.​[^[22]] Support is lacking for the use of injection therapy alone for management of persistent neck pain/whiplash, and rehabilitation and work re-entry are recommended.

 There is limited and poor-quality evidence for treatment with epidural corticosteroid and lidocaine for chronic neck pain.​[^[22]]

Cervical zygapophyseal (facet) joint corticosteroids injection has been used for post-WAD of more than 3 months. A systematic review found the evidence was inadequate; 1 randomized controlled trial found that pain reduction after 5 months was not greater compared with placebo.​[^[14]]

A short course of epidural or selective root injection with corticosteroid may be associated with short-term symptomatic improvement of radicular symptoms, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend radiofrequency neurotomy for suspected zygapophyseal pain. There is no evidence that cervical root or epidural injections decrease the rate of open surgery in seriously symptomatic radiculopathy.​[^[41]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Neck pain is known to be exacerbated during pregnancy, especially if there is coexistent low back pain and weight gain. During breastfeeding, proper positioning, using supports and pillows, and feeding while lying down help to minimize neck pain. For further discussion of therapeutic choices during pregnancy and breastfeeding for patients with neck pain, see Low Back Pain. A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for the management of Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD). It outlines the process from initial assessment to treatment based on WAD classification.

### Initial Assessment
- **Components:**
  - History
  - Physical examination
  - Neurologic exam
  - Radiography (if red flags are present, see Table 1)

### WAD Classification
- The flowchart splits into two branches based on WAD classification:
  - **WAD I–III**
  - **WAD IV**

### WAD I–III Management
1. **Symptom Relief:**
   - Reassure the patient
   - Recommend normal activity
   - Avoid immobilization

2. **By 1 Month:**
   - If no improvement:
     - Plan radiographs
     - Evaluate for psychosocial factors
     - Promote active therapy
     - Encourage return to work (if not already working)
     - Monitor progress and ensure adherence

3. **By 3 Months:**
   - If not progressing:
     - Multidisciplinary rehabilitation
     - Liaison with stakeholders
     - Set goals to restore function and return to work

### WAD IV Management
- **Urgent surgical consultation and management** is recommended.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing WAD, emphasizing early intervention, monitoring, and multidisciplinary care for non-progressing cases.

![](images/neckpainwhiplash_cancsprul.gif)


**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart designed to guide the decision-making process for determining the need for radiography in alert and stable trauma patients where cervical spine injury is a concern. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

### Title
- **For all alert and stable trauma patients where cervical spine injury is a concern**

### Decision Points

1. **High-Risk Factors**
   - **Question:** Any high-risk factor which mandates radiography?
   - **Criteria:**
     - Age ≥ 65 years
     - Dangerous mechanism (noted as "a")
     - Paresthesias in extremities
   - **Outcome:**
     - If **Yes**, proceed to **Radiography**.
     - If **No**, move to the next decision point.

2. **Low-Risk Factors**
   - **Question:** Any low-risk factor which allows safe assessment of range of motion?
   - **Criteria:**
     - Simple rear-end MVC (noted as "b")
     - Sitting position in emergency department
     - Ambulatory at any time
     - Delayed onset of neck pain
     - Absence of midline C-spine tenderness
   - **Outcome:**
     - If **No**, proceed to **Radiography**.
     - If **Yes**, move to the next decision point.

3. **Neck Rotation Ability**
   - **Question:** Able to actively rotate neck? (45° left and right)
   - **Outcome:**
     - If **Unable**, proceed to **Radiography**.
     - If **Able**, proceed to **No radiography**.

### Notes
- The flowchart uses annotations "a" and "b" to indicate specific notes or references related to "Dangerous mechanism" and "Simple rear-end MVC," respectively.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to assess whether radiography is necessary based on the presence of high-risk factors, low-risk factors, and the patient's ability to rotate their neck.
