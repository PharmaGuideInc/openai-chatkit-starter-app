#### Introduction

Constipation in children is a common problem with an estimated prevalence of 9.5% across the pediatric age spectrum (0–18 years).​[^[1]] This number may be even higher among infants to early school-aged children around the time of toilet training.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]

The majority of constipation in children is functional, which implies it cannot be attributed to another medical problem, e.g., structural or anatomical problems. Functional constipation is not simply a diagnosis of exclusion and should be made with the use of the Rome IV diagnostic criteria​[^[4]]​[^[5]] (see Table 1 and Table 2). While one should take a careful history and physical examination to evaluate for red flags, organic or secondary causes of constipation are generally uncommon and an extensive workup is rarely warranted.

Although risk factors for constipation in children include lifestyle factors such as diet and fluid intake, it is most often the result of withholding of the feces. Withholding behaviour stems from a desire to avoid pain associated with the passage of hard stools.​[^[6]] In infants, the introduction of semi-solid food or switching from breast milk to formula or whole milk are risk factors for constipation. While both sexes are affected by constipation, males are more likely to experience encopresis/fecal incontinence (the involuntary leakage of fecal material), something which can be more easily diagnosed once the child no longer wears diapers.​[^[7]]

Constipation can greatly affect a patient’s and family’s quality of life and often has subsequent effects on physical, social and emotional well-being,​[^[8]] as well as health-care utilization.​[^[9]]

#### Goals of Therapy



It may take months to years to achieve the goals of therapy for childhood constipation, and relapses are common.

#### Investigations

The diagnostic criteria for functional childhood constipation are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. There is no standard workup for children with constipation; diagnosis is based predominantly on history and physical exam and ruling out red flags (see Table 3).​[^[10]] 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| History | Constipation onset in the first month of lifePassage of meconium after 48 h of lifeRibbon stoolsRectal bleeding with blood in stool (no anal fissure present) |
| Physical exam | Failure to thrive/poor growth |
| Abdominal exam | Severe abdominal distention |
| Perianal/low back exam | Abnormal position of the anusDecreased lower extremity tone/reflexTuft or hair on spineSacral dimpleGluteal cleft deviation |
| Rectal exam | Explosive stool following digital rectal examination |


#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic interventions are often discussed before or in conjunction with medication.​[^[16]]



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Most children with persistent constipation will require pharmacologic therapy. Generally there is a clean-out phase to evacuate retained stool, followed by maintenance therapy. A written plan for clean-out and maintenance can be of significant value to the family. Table 4 details the drugs used in the management of constipation in children.

The osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350) is the primary choice for most children despite the manufacturers’ standard disclaimer that it is indicated only for the treatment of intermittent constipation in adults. PEG 3350 can be used for both clean-out therapy and maintenance therapy.​[^[19]] For clean-out therapy, high dose PEG 3350 (1.5 g/kg/day) is not inferior to rectal therapy (enemas) even when fecal impaction is present​[^[20]] and it has the associated benefits of greater convenience and less discomfort, which can support breaking the cycle of withholding. However, the effect is not immediate; it often takes 24–48 hours for bowel evacuation to be achieved.

For maintenance, PEG 3350 has been shown to be more effective than other osmotic agents such as lactulose and to cause less bloating and abdominal pain.​[^[21]] Lactulose is considered a second-line agent and generally used only if PEG 3350 is unavailable. Mineral oil is also less effective than PEG 3350 and may cause anal leakage and staining of the undergarments; it should not be used in children <1 year of age or those at increased risk of aspiration. For all maintenance therapy, dose titration is often required and can be carried out by the family to ensure a soft ‘mushy’ (but not watery) stool is produced without any leakage.

Refractory cases may require the use of stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl.​[^[22]] One approach suggests using senna or bisacodyl if there are no stools after 3 days of therapy with an osmotic agent. While there is often a dogmatic teaching against the use of stimulant laxatives due to concerns regarding dependency and cramping, there is minimal evidence to support this,​[^[23]] especially if they are used on an as-needed basis. Stimulant laxatives may also provide stimulatory feedback for patients who have minimal sensation.

Newer oral agents such as prokinetics (e.g., prucalopride) and secretagogues (e.g., linaclotide, lubiprostone) have a negligible role in the treatment of pediatric functional constipation.

In general, rectal therapy should be avoided; however, glycerin suppositories are often used for immediate relief, particularly in infants. Enemas containing sodium phosphates are an option if bowel evacuation is desired. The administration of a rectal treatment is often challenging and requires assistance even if the child is cooperative.

Treatment duration for chronic constipation should be in months with full improvement maintained for at least 1 month before weaning therapy.​[^[10]] A fair number of set backs or relapses can be expected; these may be due to a change in schedule, diet, school attendance, travel, fears and phobias, or no identifiable reason. If a relapse of constipation occurs, a repeat of clean-out therapy may be required.

Risk factors for slower improvement or increased relapses include being male, having constipation before 1 year of age, having encopresis,​[^[24]] having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),​[^[25]] having neurodevelopmental disabilities,​[^[26]] or having a history of abuse or childhood adverse events.​[^[27]]

Despite highlighting the difficult course, most pediatric constipation will improve with support and time​[^[28]] and does not result in lifelong chronic symptoms.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a table illustrating the Bristol Stool Chart, which categorizes stool forms based on their appearance and type. It is used to assess bowel health.

### Table Structure:

- **Columns:**
  1. **Stool Form:** Describes the physical characteristics of the stool.
  2. **Appearance:** Visual representation of the stool type.
  3. **Type:** Numerical classification from 1 to 7.

### Stool Types:

1. **Type 1:**
   - **Stool Form:** Separate hard lumps like nuts, hard to pass.
   - **Appearance:** Small, round, hard lumps.
   - **Description:** Result of slow transit.

2. **Type 2:**
   - **Stool Form:** Sausage-shaped but lumpy.
   - **Appearance:** Lumpy, sausage-like form.

3. **Type 3:**
   - **Stool Form:** Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface.
   - **Appearance:** Sausage shape with surface cracks.

4. **Type 4:**
   - **Stool Form:** Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
   - **Appearance:** Smooth, elongated form.

5. **Type 5:**
   - **Stool Form:** Soft blobs with clear-cut edges, easy to pass.
   - **Appearance:** Soft, distinct blobs.

6. **Type 6:**
   - **Stool Form:** Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool.
   - **Appearance:** Fluffy, irregular pieces.

7. **Type 7:**
   - **Stool Form:** Watery, no solid pieces.
   - **Appearance:** Completely liquid.
   - **Description:** Result of very fast transit.

This chart helps in identifying bowel habits and potential digestive issues based on stool form and consistency.
