#### Introduction

Upper GI bleeding (UGIB) is a common medical emergency, especially in older persons with comorbid conditions, and has a mortality rate of about 3%.​[^[1]] Nonvariceal causes of upper GI bleeding are most common and include duodenal ulcer (DU), gastric ulcer (GU) and gastric or esophageal erosions. Less frequent causes include a malignancy affecting the upper GI tract, an eroded gastric blood vessel (Dieulafoy lesion) or a tear of the gastroesophageal junction (Mallory-Weiss tear).​[^[2]] Gastrointestinal varices (enlarged veins) are found mainly in the esophagus and stomach and represent about 10% of all causes of UGIB in Canada.​[^[3]] The liver scarring found in cirrhosis prevents usual drainage of splanchnic blood flow through the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava; instead, the blood is redirected through a number of portosystemic vascular shunts. This results in an increase in luminal pressure in submucosal veins, i.e., the varices. The varices can eventually rupture into the lumen of the digestive tract and cause serious bleeding.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 illustrates the approach to the management of acute nonvariceal UGIB, and Figure 2 outlines the management of acute variceal UGIB. Table 3 details the parenteral drugs used in the management of UGIB. Table 4 details the oral drugs used in the management of UGIB.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Provide adequate intravascular volume resuscitation, dictated by the rapidity of blood loss and adequacy of cardiorespiratory status to tolerate appropriate fluid replacement, in the form of crystalloid fluids if suspected nonvariceal etiology or in the form of blood products if a variceal cause is more likely. Data suggest improved outcomes will be achieved by adopting a more restrictive transfusional policy (e.g., transfusing patients when the Hb level falls below 70–80 g/L or higher) in patients without associated coronary artery disease or massive hemorrhage.​[^[4]]​[^[11]]​[^[23]]

Protect the airway, provide supplementary nasal oxygen and insert at least 2 large-bore (18 gauge or larger) IV lines. Fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stability are essential before attempting an EGD. In the patient with severe and continued active bleeding, intubation may be needed prior to patient sedation and EGD to prevent aspiration.

#### Endoscopic Hemostatic Treatment

Endoscopic triage provides for assessment of the risk of the UGIB.​[^[24]] In nonvariceal bleeding, single or multiple therapeutic modalities may be indicated, although injection of epinephrine alone is inferior and should no longer be practiced.​[^[25]] Gastric and duodenal ulcers are the most common lesions in Canadian patients with nonvariceal UGIB. In the more serious lesions seen in an EGD, such as an ulcer with a visible vessel or active bleeding (oozing or spurting), endoscopic hemostatic treatment (EHT) must be used, as these modalities improve outcomes.​[^[26]] EHT involves coaptive thermal coagulation, injection of 1:10 000 or 1:20 000 epinephrine in saline​[^[27]] and/or mechanical techniques (banding, Hemoclip, staples, sutures).​[^[2]] Hemostatic powders have become available and may be used as initial or rescue hemostatic modality.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] More recently, over-the-scope clips have been shown to be useful in refractory cases and may be useful as primary endoscopic approach.​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]] Angiographic embolization is usually reserved for patients failing a second attempt of EHT, and surgery is reserved for refractory or special cases.​[^[33]] A routine second-look EGD is suggested only in select patients at very high risk of rebleeding.

After EHT, the 30-day rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality are respectively reported to be in the order of 14.1%, 6.5% and 5.4%.​[^[34]]

In nonvariceal UGIB, an EGD can be considered in patients who are anticoagulated (as long as the INR is not supratherapeutic for patients on vitamin K antagonists; the INR does not confidently reflect anticoagulation status for patients on direct oral anticoagulants) and in patients exhibiting a platelet count of at least 50–100 × 10​[^9]/L. The presentation of GI bleeding while on an antithrombotic agent warrants a dedicated approach that is discussed in detail in the clinical practice tool accompanying the American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian Association of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]

In bleeding esophageal varices, endoscopic variceal band ligation or sclerotherapy is highly effective in stopping bleeding and preventing rebleeding.​[^[5]]​[^[22]] Band ligation is preferred because there are fewer complications. For bleeding gastric varices, the tissue adhesive cyanoacrylate may be carefully applied. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided therapies have shown promise.​[^[5]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

When primary endoscopic treatment is indicated in patients with variceal or nonvariceal bleeding, pharmacologic therapy can be considered as adjuvant treatment to yield further improvement in outcomes.

PPIs, usually in IV form, may be considered prior to EGD and may result in downgrading of high-risk endoscopic ulcer lesions, but this has not been shown to improve outcomes.​[^[4]]​[^[37]] In circumstances where an early EGD is not available, cost analysis supports the use of IV PPIs before EGD.​[^[38]]

#### Nonvariceal Upper GI Bleeding

Optimal therapy for nonvariceal UGIB (see Figure 1) includes an early EGD (within 24 hours of the initial bleeding episode) and an appropriate EHT (depending on the nature of the bleeding site). Intravenous PPIs are required if an EHT is performed for active bleeding or a visible nonbleeding vessel; the best evidence supports using a high-dose IV infusion after successful endoscopic treatment, especially for patients bleeding from ulcers.​[^[39]] Use of oral or IV H2-receptor antagonists is not recommended.

In patients with nonvariceal UGIB, high-dose PPIs (e.g., pantoprazole) via IV infusion or intermittent bolus dosing significantly reduce rebleeding, the need for surgery, the need for repeated endoscopic treatment and mortality among patients at highest risk (having first undergone a successful EHT for active bleeding, a visible nonbleeding vessel or an adherent clot).​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]]​[^[44]] Since most episodes of recurrent bleeding occur during the first 3 days after successful treatment, evidence supports the use of IV PPIs for 72 hours after EHT (e.g., high-dose IV pantoprazole 80 mg bolus followed by a 72-hour continuous infusion of 8 mg/h).​[^[45]] In patients presenting with a bleeding ulcer while on cardioprotective doses of ASA, continued use of ASA or reintroduction within 3–5 days post EGD if it has been stopped, is recommended.​[^[35]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]

Pantoprazole and omeprazole are the most extensively studied parenteral PPIs for UGIB, but IV omeprazole is not approved in Canada. Intravenous pantoprazole is administered by continuous infusion or intermittent dosing (Table 3). After 3 days of IV therapy, switching to an oral PPI (Table 4) is indicated to heal the associated ulcer, erosions or esophagitis. Where IV PPIs are not available, oral omeprazole 40 mg (or the equivalent dose of another oral PPI)​[^[48]] may be administered BID, although the data supporting this option are weaker.​[^[49]] Following discharge, the PPI is continued at a dose and duration determined by the cause of bleeding and the presence of ongoing risk factors for recurrent bleeding (e.g., ongoing ASA or NSAID use; see Figure 1). In high-risk patients (Rockall score >6) who have bled from ulcers, an oral PPI BID is indicated for the first 10 days following IV administration.​[^[50]] Treatment is then continued based upon the diagnosis; patients with esophagitis continue oral PPI BID for a total oral PPI treatment period of 8 weeks whereas dosage is reduced to once daily in those with duodenal and gastric ulcers for a total oral PPI treatment period of 4 weeks for duodenal ulcers and 8 weeks for gastric ulcers.

Somatostatin and its analogue octreotide reduce acid and pepsin secretion as well as mucosal blood flow. Their exact role in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding remains largely undefined. More evidence for their efficacy and safety is required before widespread use can be recommended.​[^[51]] Tranexamic acid has not been shown to improve outcomes and is not indicated in the routine management of patients with nonvariceal or variceal upper GI bleeding. It may be considered in select patients presenting with massive hemorrhage.​[^[14]]​[^[52]]

In the case of bleeding ulcers, treat H. pylori–positive patients with quadruple therapy for 14 days​[^[53]] (see Table 2 for recommended regimens), then continue PPI therapy for 4 weeks for duodenal ulcers and 8 weeks for gastric ulcers or esophagitis. Confirmation of H. pylori eradication with a urea breath test, stool antigen test or gastric biopsy is required because of high rebleeding rates in patients with a history of bleeding ulcers.​[^[54]] If H. pylori has not cleared, re-treat with appropriate second-line therapy (see Table 2). Repeat testing to confirm eradication of H. pylori at least 4 weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy (at least 10 days and ideally 14 days after PPI therapy is stopped).​[^[53]]

If the patient has an idiopathic ulcer (not associated with H. pylori), or if the use of ASA/NSAID or antithrombotic cannot be stopped, they should continue long-term, secondary prophylaxis with PPIs for life to reduce the risk of rebleeding (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease).​[^[11]] Some guidelines also recommend ongoing PPI prophylaxis after *H. pylori* eradication. Clinicians should document the lifelong need for PPI therapy due to an UGIB in the patient’s chart and on their PPI prescriptions.

#### Bleeding Esophageal Varices

PPIs do not play a critical role in the care of the patient with bleeding esophageal varices; however, they may be used after sclerotherapy to prevent or to treat esophageal ulceration associated with variceal banding.

Antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections is an integral part of therapy for patients with cirrhosis presenting with UGIB and should be started at time of admission. Antibiotics reduce bacterial infections, all-cause mortality, rebleeding events and length of hospitalization.​[^[55]] The most common infections are UTIs, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, respiratory infections and primary bacteremia. Oral fluoroquinolones are recommended for most patients (norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily), but IV ceftriaxone (1 g daily) is considered in patients with advanced cirrhosis, in hospital settings with a high prevalence of quinolone-resistant bacterial infections and in patients on previous quinolone prophylaxis; these agents should be continued for the first 5–7 days.​[^[20]]​[^[55]]​[^[56]]

For bleeding esophageal varices, EHT (banding and, less often, sclerotherapy) should be supplemented acutely with pharmacologic agents aimed at reducing portal pressure (see Figure 2). The long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide reduces portal pressure and bleeding. Octreotide IV can be started prior to esophageal banding and continued for up to 5 days following the procedure.​[^[20]] For bleeding gastric or duodenal varices, injection of tissue adhesives are indicated with or without endoscopic ultrasound guidance.​[^[5]]

Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (ideally within 24 h) should be considered in patients with a high risk of treatment failure (e.g., Child-Pugh class C >14 points or class B with active bleeding) or after early recurrent bleeding or failed endoscopic hemostasis.​[^[5]] In patients failing initial management who continue to bleed, bridging to more definitive therapy can be carried out by inserting an esophageal balloon tamponade tube or dedicated esophageal self-expandable stent.​[^[57]]

#### Secondary Prevention of Variceal Bleeding

First-line therapy in secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding for all patients is the combination of a nonselective beta blocker (e.g., propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) with endoscopic variceal band ligation.​[^[5]] The nonselective beta blocker should be reduced or discontinued if a patient develops a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) or an acute kidney injury.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

EHT can be performed in the pregnant patient with an upper GI bleed; preferably avoiding thermal unipolar electrocoagulation modalities. Suitable monitoring of the fetus is necessary, and obstetrical assistance must be immediately available. PPIs are considered safe for use in pregnancy​[^[58]]​[^[59]]​[^[60]] and may be utilized based on the endoscopic nature of the lesion. There is little available evidence on the safety of PPIs during breastfeeding; however, based on low concentration of PPIs in breast milk and the destruction of ingested PPIs in the infant’s acidic stomach, it is unlikely that PPIs in breast milk affect an infant’s development. Limited human data suggest omeprazole and pantoprazole are probably compatible with breastfeeding if a PPI is necessary.​[^[61]]​[^[62]]​[^[63]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart for managing patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with risk stratification using the Glasgow Blatchford score (GBS) and Rockall score. Here’s a detailed description:

1. **Initial Steps:**
   - Ensure ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and adequate resuscitation.
   - Perform risk stratification pre-EGD using the Glasgow Blatchford score.

2. **Risk Stratification:**
   - **GBS 0–1:**
     - Discharge home.
     - Out-patient EGD.
   - **GBS ≥2:**
     - Hospitalize.
     - In-patient EGD.

3. **Post-EGD Management:**
   - **Low-risk lesion (from EGD):**
     - Initiate daily dose oral Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI).
   - **High-risk lesion (from EGD):**
     - Perform Endoscopic Hemostatic Therapy (EHT).
     - Initiate high-dose IV PPI for 3 days.
     - Follow oral PPI regimen based on patient risk level.

4. **Secondary Prophylaxis:**
   - Consider for all patients:
     - Test for *Helicobacter pylori* and treat if present.
     - Replace traditional NSAIDs with COX-2 inhibitors if appropriate.
     - Long-term secondary prophylaxis with PPI if idiopathic ulcer or if ASA/NSAID or antithrombotic cannot be discontinued.
     - Some guidelines recommend ongoing PPI prophylaxis after *H. pylori* eradication.

5. **High-risk Patient Classification:**
   - Determine if the patient is classified as high risk (Rockall score >6).
   - **If Yes:**
     - Oral PPI twice daily for <10 days, then:
       - Duodenal ulcer: Oral PPI once daily for 4 weeks.
       - Gastric ulcer: Oral PPI once daily for 8 weeks.
       - Esophagitis: Oral PPI twice daily for 8 weeks.
   - **If No:**
     - Duodenal ulcer: Oral PPI once daily for 4 weeks.
     - Gastric ulcer: Oral PPI once daily for 8 weeks.
     - Esophagitis: Oral PPI twice daily for 8 weeks.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing patients based on their risk assessment and EGD findings, with specific recommendations for PPI therapy and secondary prophylaxis.
