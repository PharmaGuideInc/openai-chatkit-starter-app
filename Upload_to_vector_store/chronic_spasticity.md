#### Introduction

Spasticity is an involuntary velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone resulting from injury to the motor pathways in the brain or spinal cord. It is common in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke and cerebral palsy. Spasticity usually occurs as part of the upper motor neuron (UMN) complex, which consists of weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign and slow coordination. It may also present with spastic dystonia (tonic muscle activity at rest) and co-contractions (inappropriate contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles).

Spasticity can impair feeding, dressing, bowel/bladder function, hygiene and gait. It can also reduce joint range of movement, cause contractures (shortening of muscles that leads to joint dysfunction) and result in significant pain and skin breakdown. However, spasticity is not always impairing and can facilitate some movements by providing posture and tone in what would otherwise be a flaccid limb. It can allow weight-bearing in a plegic limb by essentially “bracing” that limb. Furthermore, treatment of spasticity can sometimes worsen ambulation by unmasking limb weakness. Thus, spasticity should be treated only when it interferes with function and care or when it results in pain. Goals of therapy should be outlined before initiating treatment (e.g., pain control, improvement in gait). A multi-disciplinary approach is most often required and may include neurology, physiatry, physiotherapy and orthotics.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

An algorithm for the management of chronic spasticity is shown in Figure 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Search for aggravating factors if spasticity has increased in a stable patient. This can include pressure areas, infections (bladder, toenail), bladder stones, constipation and DVT.

Always recommend physical measures including daily stretching and range-of-movement exercises. Braces may be used to maintain a spastic limb in a reflex-inhibiting posture and to prevent contractures.

TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) is increasingly used as an adjuvant physical therapy.​[^[3]] TENS devices for home use are relatively inexpensive and can be applied for 30 minutes daily to the affected nerve or muscle belly. Initial consultation with an experienced physiotherapist can be helpful, and combination with exercise shows added benefit.​[^[3]]

Permanent selective neurotomy may be considered, particularly in focal spasticity. Other surgical treatments for spasticity tend to be reserved for the most refractory cases and are rarely considered. Orthopedic procedures, such as lengthening, releasing or transferring a tendon, do not treat the underlying spasticity but may help optimize function and prevent contractures.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

The treatment for focal spasticity that occurs in a limited number of muscle groups differs from that which occurs in a more generalized pattern.

#### Generalized Spasticity

Oral medications (see Table 1) remain important in the treatment of generalized spasticity. Most of the drugs recommended for the management of spasticity have a central mode of action. A number of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy (reduction in muscle tone) of antispasticity medications, although systematic reviews have found that the studies were limited.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] Clinical experience has shown that efficacy is better in spasticity of spinal origin (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) than of cerebral origin (brain injury, stroke).

Baclofen is the standard initial medication for spasticity.​[^[6]] It must be titrated gradually to an effective dose. Adverse effects such as sedation can limit its use, especially in patients who are brain injured. Baclofen can result in muscle weakness (while taking the medication); this should be assessed with each dose titration, especially in ambulatory patients. Because of the central effect of this medication, abrupt discontinuation can result in confusion, seizures and hallucinations.

Tizanidine can be tried as an initial option​[^[7]] or in combination with baclofen, as the 2 agents have different sites of action. As with all antispasticity drugs, the incidence of adverse effects is high, but trials show no decrease in muscle strength,​[^[8]] which is a major adverse effect of baclofen. Side effects of dry mouth and drowsiness can limit the use of tizanidine, particularly in brain-injured patients.

Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clonazepam can be useful for treating spasms, especially if these are problematic at night. Daytime use of these drugs is limited by their sedating effects.

Gabapentin may be a useful alternative or addition in managing spasticity, especially if there is concurrent neuropathic pain.​[^[9]]

A cannabis extract delivered by buccal spray containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/​cannabidiol (THC/CBD) has shown modest efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials and is officially indicated for the treatment of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis.​[^[10]] It may also be considered in patients with coexisting pain,​[^[11]]​[^[12]] although its official indication for pain relief (not spasticity) has been withdrawn by Health Canada due to lack of evidence.​[^[13]] It may also be beneficial as add-on therapy.​[^[14]] However, the cannabis extract spray is expensive and not covered by most public payers.

Oral and/or inhaled cannabis, although possibly effective, is not recommended for management of spasticity, due to lack of standardized dosing and safety verification.​[^[15]] If the patient pursues cannabis use, medically licensed products are preferred. Oral nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is often used off-label in cases of pain and spasticity, but is supported by limited evidence.​[^[16]] 

Although dantrolene is officially indicated in the management of spasticity, it is rarely used due to significant hepatotoxicity and insufficient evidence to support its efficacy.​[^[15]]​[^[17]]

Intrathecal delivery of medication is usually indicated when oral medications fail to control spasticity or when side effects are intolerable. A programmable pump, usually implanted in the anterior abdominal wall, delivers small continuous or bolus amounts of drug (usually baclofen) into the spinal fluid. Cognitive side effects are minimal because the drug is acting locally at the level of the spinal cord. The effect on spasticity can be profound, although it is more effective for lower limb tone due to a concentration gradient from lumbar to cervical levels.​[^[18]]

Treatment with chemodenervation using local agents such as botulinum toxins or phenol-alcohol blocks can be used as adjunctive therapy for general spasticity or as primary therapy in focal spasticity (see Focal Spasticity).​[^[19]]​[^[20]]

#### Focal Spasticity

When spasticity is focal (e.g., club foot, stiff-knee gait) or general, but focally disabling, then focal treatment is effective and preferred to avoid significant CNS adverse effects associated with systemic therapy.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]

Focal treatment of spastic muscles involves temporary chemodenervation using local agents such as onabotulinumtoxinA (see Table 1) or phenol-alcohol injections to reduce spasticity selectively, leaving some muscle groups with tone that is functional. Physical therapy following injections has generally been recommended for maximal benefit, although evidence that this combination improves motor function is not clear.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] There are no randomized trials, but there is growing evidence that focal reduction in spasticity can improve hand function and stiff-knee gait.

Phenol-alcohol injections block nerves going to specific spastic muscle groups; treatment is repeated every 6 months as required. Injections can be uncomfortable with adverse effects that include pain, dysesthesias and infection.

Botulinum toxin (type A) is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing weakness (reduced tone) in the treated muscle; doses are typically injected every 3 months and require referral to an experienced injector.​[^[24]] There are 3 commercially available type A toxins (onabotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA), each with distinct dosing and pharmacokinetic profiles. It is a relatively safe medication with few serious side effects, making it a suitable option for the pediatric population.​[^[25]] Evidence from several meta-analyses has demonstrated significant decreases in muscle tone and improved passive function with botulinum toxin therapy.​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Randomized trials have also shown improvement in both pain and motion with intramuscular administration of onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with spastic shoulder pain after stroke.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]] This intervention may be more effective than intra-articular steroid injections.​[^[30]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Spasticity and Pregnancy

Spasticity management during pregnancy should be discussed prior to pregnancy planning. Most medications used in the management of spasticity have potentially adverse or unknown effects on the fetus during pregnancy. The use of oral medications must balance the benefits and risks, taking into account the severity of spasticity and potentially safer treatment options (e.g., focal injections, intrathecal delivery). The treatment plan should include measures to decrease noxious stimuli and the use of physical therapy and stretching to avoid or limit the need for medication. Medications may need to be tapered prior to conception to avoid withdrawal issues.

Baclofen has shown potential harm during gestation based on animal studies. There are also documented cases of neonatal withdrawal postpartum.​[^[31]] **Intrathecal** baclofen **(ITB)** has been used in several reported pregnancies without adverse effects on the fetus or pregnancy, and may be an option in severe cases of spasticity. Plasma baclofen levels in individuals with an ITB pump are essentially undetectable.​[^[32]] Tizanidine may cause fetal harm based on animal studies.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] Gabapentin crosses the placenta, and there is insufficient human data to determine if it can be used safely during pregnancy.​[^[34]] Benzodiazepines have been shown to have increased risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weight, low Apgar score and neonatal intensive care unit admission.​[^[35]] Cannabinoids should be avoided in pregnancy; there is no known safe level of cannabis, including CBD, during pregnancy.​[^[36]]​[^[37]] **Botulinum toxin** has a large molecular weight; drugs of this size cross into the placenta poorly and so passive diffusion is unlikely.​[^[38]] Botulinum toxin also demonstrated a malformation rate similar to the general population rate in a database of pregnancy outcomes following exposure.​[^[39]] Because of the lower biologic plausibility of fetal harm, such focal injections may be more preferable than oral medications.

#### Spasticity and Breastfeeding

Baclofen is compatible with breastfeeding, as very low amounts are present in breast milk.​[^[40]] Tizanidine is lipid-soluble and may pass into breast milk.​[^[33]] **Gabapentin** is present in breast milk but daily doses less than 2.1 g led to low levels in infant serum. Caution should be used if combining with other sedating medications.​[^[40]] Benzodiazepines have been shown to be transferred into breast milk, but in small amounts that may be compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[41]] Monitor infant for adverse effects if benzodiazepine use is required. The use of cannabinoids should be avoided during lactation, as they do pass into breast milk. There is little published data available on their safety for developing infants.​[^[36]]​[^[40]] **Botulinum toxin** does not pass into breast milk and may be considered if used in standard doses.​[^[40]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart for managing chronic spasticity. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Chronic Spasticity**:
   - Initial step: "Eliminate aggravating factors; try aggressive stretching."

2. **Persistent Spasticity**:
   - Decision point: "Persistent spasticity that impairs function, care, or comfort."
   - If "No": "No further treatment required."
   - If "Yes": Proceed to further evaluation.

3. **Spasticity Type**:
   - **Focal**:
     - Treatment: "Botulinum toxin type A or phenol injections."
     - Consideration: "Consider permanent selective neurotomy."
   - **Generalized**:
     - Initial treatment: "Baclofen."
     - If ineffective or intolerant: "Add or switch to tizanidine."
     - Further options: "Add or switch to gabapentin or THC/CBD buccal spray."

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - "Benzodiazepines can be added for nighttime control of spasms/spasticity in limited doses."
   - "At any point, consider botulinum toxin type A or phenol injections for severely affected muscle groups."
   - "Baclofen intrathecal pump" as a further option.

5. **General Guidelines**:
   - "At any point in the steps below":
     - "Titrate gradually to target dose (see Table 1)."
     - "Intolerance at low dose or ineffective at target dose: titrate to discontinue and switch to another agent."
     - "Intolerance at target (higher) dose: reduce dose according to tolerance and add on another agent."

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing chronic spasticity, with specific treatments and considerations based on the type and severity of spasticity.
