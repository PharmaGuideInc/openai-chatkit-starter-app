CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “male” and “female” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

This chapter discusses ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, cholestatic liver disease (including symptom management), autoimmune hepatitis, alcohol-related liver disease (including alcohol-related hepatitis), hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson disease. Management of esophageal varices is discussed in Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Ascites (Portal Hypertension)

Ascites is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. There are a number of causes for ascites formation including cirrhosis, heart failure and cancer. This section discusses management of ascites caused by increased pressure within the portal vein (portal hypertension) in patients with cirrhosis, as well as the infectious complication affecting people with ascites, called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (i.e., an infection of ascites fluid without an identifiable abdominal source).

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 outlines the management of ascites secondary to portal hypertension and Table 1 lists the drugs used to treat ascites.

Sodium intake should be restricted to <2 g/day. High plasma aldosterone levels in patients with ascites result in sodium and fluid retention; thus, spironolactone (an aldosterone antagonist) is the diuretic of choice. The clearance of spironolactone and its active metabolites are impaired in advanced cirrhosis. Full therapeutic diuretic effect can take up to 2 weeks to be observed; adjust dose slowly in this setting. There is evidence that starting with a combination of spironolactone and furosemide may enhance diuresis versus spironolactone alone.​[^[2]] In addition, furosemide helps to control serum potassium levels. Metolazone can be added if ascites is refractory to spironolactone and furosemide. The combination of furosemide and metolazone can produce profound diuresis, causing volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities, e.g., hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia. Start with low doses and titrate up. Amiloride can be substituted for spironolactone if intolerable side effects develop; it has a more rapid onset of action and clearance than spironolactone.

Avoid NSAIDs due to potential renal toxicity.​[^[2]] Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) may induce significant hypotension and associated renal impairment.​[^[2]] Consider stopping proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as they increase risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis​[^[3]] (see Deprescribing).

Refractory ascites has been defined as ascites that cannot be mobilized adequately due to diuretic-induced complications or lack of response.​[^[2]] For these patients, repeated large volume paracentesis or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be considered.​[^[2]]

Patients who develop moderate to severe ascites have a high 2-year mortality and should be considered for referral for liver transplant assessment.​[^[2]]

#### Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is life-threatening and the most frequent type of infection in patients with cirrhosis. It is most likely caused by translocation of pathogenic bacteria from the gut to ascitic fluid. Risk factors for poor outcomes include advanced age, higher Child-Pugh score, need for intensive care, nosocomial acquisition, associated hepatic encephalopathy, elevated creatinine and bilirubin, lack of response to therapy, and the presence of bacteremia.

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Table 2 lists drugs used to treat spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

If the PMN cell count in the ascitic fluid is >0.25 × 10​[^9]/L (250 cells/µL), a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) can be made. Treatment varies between community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired SBP:





Based on the best available evidence, norfloxacin (400 mg/day) is considered the drug of choice for both primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis.​[^[2]]​[^[7]]​[^[8]] For secondary SBP prophylaxis, start norfloxacin after the completion of IV antibiotic therapy for the acute episode and continue until resolution of ascites or liver transplantation.​[^[2]] Patients with an episode of SBP should be referred and considered for possible liver transplantation if eligible.

#### Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis and liver failure that includes behavioral changes (day-night reversal), changes in cognition (confusion, disorientation) and altered level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma). HE is diagnosed clinically after excluding other potential causes.

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 2 outlines the management of hepatic encephalopathy and Table 3 lists the drugs used to treat hepatic encephalopathy.

Nonabsorbable disaccharides (e.g., lactulose) have proven beneficial in the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy and reduce liver-related morbidities and all-cause mortality.​[^[9]] An alternative to starting with lactulose is polyethylene glycol 3350 (4L via nasogastric tube over 4 h) then starting lactulose on day 2. The poorly absorbed antibiotic rifaximin reduces the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adults and appears to decrease numbers of all-cause hospital admissions.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] It is reasonable to consider rifaximin in individuals who are refractory to or cannot tolerate lactulose, or in combination with lactulose to prevent recurrent episodes of HE after a second episode. In patients who have developed hepatic encephalopathy, consideration should be given for referral for possible liver transplantation, if eligible.

In patients with severe, refractory hepatic encephalopathy, the presence of large dominant porto-systemic shunts should be sought; if found in individuals with preserved liver function, embolization should be considered.​[^[12]]

#### Cholestatic Liver Disease

Cholestatic liver disease is caused by a failure of bile flow out of the liver, with an associated retention of bile acids and other substances normally excreted in bile. Over time, cholestasis can lead to liver damage, fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis and liver failure. This section will discuss 2 presumed autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PBC is caused by the slow, immune-mediated destruction of small bile ducts within the liver. PSC involves progressive inflammation and fibrosis affecting any part of the biliary tree, leading to the progressive destruction of medium- and large-sized extrahepatic and/or intrahepatic bile ducts. It is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), approximately 75% of PSC patients have IBD.

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 3 outlines the approach to the management of cholestatic symptoms and Table 4 lists drugs used to treat cholestatic liver disease.

#### Primary Biliary Cholangitis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA or **ursodiol**) 13–15 mg/kg/day improves serum liver biochemical tests in patients with PBC and PSC.​[^[13]]​[^[14]] It appears to have limited efficacy in preventing disease progression in PSC.​[^[14]] There is no benefit to using high-dose UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) in the management of PSC.​[^[14]] In PBC, UDCA may significantly reduce the probability of transplantation and/or death but does not reduce symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pruritus).​[^[13]]

Obeticholic acid (OCA) can be used for the treatment of PBC (as monotherapy or in combination with UDCA) in patients without cirrhosis and in those with Child-Pugh class A compensated cirrhosis and no evidence of portal hypertension who are UDCA non- or partial-responders or who cannot tolerate UDCA.​[^[15]] The most common adverse reactions reported with OCA are pruritus, fatigue, constipation, oropharyngeal pain and arthralgia.​[^[15]] OCA is contraindicated in patients with advanced liver disease including those with Child-Pugh class B or C decompensated cirrhosis, or with Child-Pugh class A compensated cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension.​[^[16]] The hepatic status of the patient must be determined prior to initiation of OCA and routinely throughout the course of treatment, and therapy must be adjusted accordingly (see Table 4).​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

For patients who are UDCA non- or partial-responders, or who cannot tolerate UDCA, and are intolerant to OCA, treatment with bezafibrate can be considered. Similar to OCA, bezafibrate improves biochemical markers of cholestasis and can also improve pruritus.​[^[19]]

Episodes of acute cholangitis in PSC require treatment with appropriate antibiotics (e.g., oral ciprofloxacin in outpatients for early mild episodes; IV ceftriaxone + metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam for hospitalized patients). PSC patients with recurrent episodes of severe acute cholangitis should be considered for referral for liver transplant assessment.

#### Vitamin Deficiencies

Vitamin A, vitamin D or vitamin K supplements may be required to treat deficiencies (usually only in chronic cholestasis). The need for vitamin E supplements in adults has not been assessed in well-designed clinical trials; however, deficiencies in pediatric patients must be treated to prevent neurological consequences.

#### Management of Pruritus

Rule out local cutaneous causes of pruritus such as eczema. Cholestyramine will benefit about 90% of patients; it must be continued as long as pruritus is present. Antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine) are of no proven benefit, but their sedative properties may help. For patients who do not respond, naltrexone,​[^[20]] rifampin​[^[21]] or sertraline​[^[22]] may be tried. Numerous other therapies have been evaluated, but all are investigational.

#### Autoimmune Hepatitis

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease of unknown cause characterized by an immune-mediated attack and destruction of liver cells (hepatocytes).

#### Investigations



The classic patient is a young female who presents with an acute or chronic illness characterized by lethargy, arthralgia, oligomenorrhea and fluctuating jaundice; however, symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and the disease is suspected by the findings of abnormal liver tests.

#### Therapeutic Choices

Table 5 includes drugs used to treat autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.

Immunosuppression with corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, prolongs life, decreases symptoms, improves serum biochemical abnormalities and diminishes hepatic inflammation on liver biopsy. The goal is to induce remission, defined as a decrease in serum aminotransferase levels to within the normal range.​[^[23]] Most patients will require therapy for up to 2 years before attempts at discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy are considered; the majority will require lifelong therapy.​[^[23]] Azathioprine is generally added to the corticosteroid regimen as a steroid-sparing agent if the dose of prednisone cannot be decreased below 10 mg/day (the goal is to eventually discontinue the corticosteroid and continue treatment with azathioprine alone). For non-cirrhotic patients who experience significant steroid-related side effects with prednisone, budesonide can be used as an alternative therapy.​[^[23]] Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing should be performed in all patients before initiating azathioprine treatment as TPMT deficiency can cause profound myelosuppression.​[^[24]] Mycophenolate **mofetil** (MMF) may be used to reduce the dose of prednisone in patients resistant to or intolerant of azathioprine; 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) may be used in patients intolerant of azathioprine.​[^[23]]

#### Alcohol-Related Liver Disease

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) constitutes a spectrum of liver changes, ranging from fatty liver (steatosis) to alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) and cirrhosis. Although chronic heavy alcohol consumption is required to develop the more severe forms of ALD, only 10–20% of chronic heavy alcohol drinkers develop AH and/or cirrhosis.

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Chronic Alcohol-Related Liver Disease

There is no universally accepted medical therapy except abstention from alcohol. To address alcohol use, see Alcohol-Related Disorders or the Alcohol Use Disorder Pathway from Alberta Health Services and Primary Care Networks.

#### Alcohol–Related Hepatitis

Table 5 includes drugs used to treat alcohol-related hepatitis.

Prednisolone (active metabolite of prednisone, used to avoid potential issues with hepatic conversion of prednisone to prednisolone in setting of severe liver dysfunction and preferred agent in alcohol-related hepatitis) can be used for the treatment of patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis (preferably biopsy-proven; Maddrey discriminant function ≥32, and/or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score >20).​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Data are conflicting regarding the effect on reducing mortality in this patient population; however, evidence suggests the beneficial effect of prednisolone for short-term (<28 days) survival only.​[^[26]]​[^[27]]

The Lille Model score is calculated for all patients with severe alcohol-related hepatitis who have been started on prednisolone therapy to define response and inform decision-making with regards to therapy discontinuation. The Lille score has traditionally been calculated at day 7 of treatment, but calculating at day 4 has similar accuracy in predicting corticosteroid response and 28– and 90–day mortality.​[^[28]] Steroid non-responders are defined by a Lille score >0.45 and further prednisolone therapy is unlikely of benefit. These individuals have a poor prognosis.​[^[26]]​[^[29]]

#### Hereditary Hemochromatosis

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that can lead to excessive iron absorption from the diet. Over time, excess iron can be deposited in certain tissues (e.g., liver, pancreas, heart), leading to damage and organ dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis is critical to prevent related complications (e.g., cirrhosis and liver cancer).

#### Investigations



The classic patient is a middle-aged male who presents with hyperpigmentation, fatigue, abdominal pain, joint pain, diminished libido, loss of body hair and diabetes mellitus; however, more typically patients present with nonspecific symptoms or signs, chronically mildly abnormal serum liver tests and abnormal iron indices.

#### Therapeutic Choices

Table 6 lists drugs used to treat iron overload in hemochromatosis.

Reduce dietary iron intake. Phlebotomy (500 mL of whole blood weekly or biweekly as tolerated) will ultimately normalize body iron stores (target is serum ferritin 50–100 µg/L);​[^[30]] when repeated weekly, this may take up to 2 years. If the patient is unable to receive phlebotomy due to other causes of iron overload (e.g., transfusions for thalassemia), chelation with deferoxamine can be tried. Patients who have developed cirrhosis need to be screened for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma with liver ultrasounds every 6 months.​[^[30]]

#### Wilson Disease

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Table 7 lists drugs used to treat Wilson disease.

Copper chelating agents (penicillamine or trientine) are the treatment of choice for Wilson disease, and treatment is lifelong. Trientine may be better tolerated. Give pyridoxine 25 mg daily with penicillamine to counteract its antipyridoxine effect. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper excretion and serum-free copper levels can be monitored to ensure adequate removal of copper. Trientine may be used in patients intolerant of penicillamine. Elemental zinc is an option in patients with mild disease, patients intolerant of penicillamine and trientine, and in maintenance treatment after induction with chelation therapy. Recommend avoiding foods high in copper, e.g., peanuts, chocolate, liver, shellfish, mushrooms.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Pregnancy in patients with chronic liver disease, especially if there is clinical evidence of liver failure (ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy), is not a frequently encountered clinical issue, as conception can be difficult, if not impossible, for these patients.

Pregnancy is more commonly observed in patients with well-controlled chronic liver diseases, such as those caused by chronic cholestatic disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease and hemochromatosis (especially in the absence of cirrhosis). There is limited available information on the effects of these diseases on pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used to treat pruritus in the setting of benign cholestasis of pregnancy. Previously, it was recommended that UDCA be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy. Emerging evidence suggests that this medication can be used throughout pregnancy without untoward effects and is safe to continue during breastfeeding.​[^[33]]

Although prednisolone/prednisone may not cause major teratogenic defects, they may increase the risk of developing oral cleft palate and are best avoided in the first trimester.​[^[34]] Prednisolone/prednisone are compatible with breastfeeding, and exposure of the nursing infant to the drug may be minimized if nursing is performed 3–4 hour after the dose is taken by the breastfeeding patient.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Azathioprine is considered low risk in pregnancy and is probably compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[37]]​[^[38]]

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is contraindicated in pregnancy.

The risk of using penicillamine in pregnancy remains unclear, but the repercussions of discontinuing penicillamine in a pregnant patient with Wilson disease may be serious; therefore, these patients should remain on penicillamine during pregnancy, but at a dose of <1 g/day. Avoid breastfeeding if the patient is receiving penicillamine; the consequences of therapy cessation in a breastfeeding patient are unclear.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Precipitating Factors:
1. **Sepsis:** Especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
2. **Nitrogen load:** Due to dietary protein over-intake, constipation, or GI bleeding.
3. **Alkalosis:** Due to overdiuresis.
4. **Dehydration:** Due to diuretics, diarrhea.
5. **Drugs:** Especially CNS-acting drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids).
6. **Electrolyte imbalance:** Hypokalemia.

#### Treatment Steps:
1. **Administer Lactulose:** 
   - Goal: Achieve 2–3 loose bowel movements per day.

2. **Evaluate Improvement in 24–48 hours:**
   - **Yes:** Continue lactulose.
   - **No:** Add rifaximin.

3. **Re-evaluate Improvement in 24–48 hours:**
   - **Yes:** Continue lactulose + rifaximin.
   - **No:** No further broadly accepted medical therapies.

### Flowchart Structure:
- The flowchart begins with identifying and treating precipitating factors.
- It then moves to administering lactulose and monitoring bowel movements.
- Subsequent steps involve assessing improvement and adjusting treatment accordingly.
- The process includes decision points based on patient response within specified time frames (24–48 hours).

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing hepatic encephalopathy by addressing underlying causes and adjusting treatment based on patient response.

| **rifampin** (Rofact) | Cholestatic pruritus:150 mg daily PO; can be increased up to 10 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses | Rash (petechial rash may suggest thrombocytopenia), discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of body fluids (contact lens staining) and teeth (which may be permanent), GI upset, hematologic effects, e.g., thrombocytopenia. | Potent inducer of CYP450; evaluate when coadministered with other drugs, e.g., may reduce levels of cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, warfarin. |
| **sertraline** (Zoloft, generics) | Cholestatic pruritus:Initial 50 mg daily PO; titrate to 75–100 mg daily PO | Nausea, tremors, diarrhea, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, increased risk of GI bleeding. | Contraindicated with MAO inhibitors (serotonin syndrome), increased risk of GI bleeding with NSAIDs. CYP450 inhibitors may increase levels. Sertraline may reduce clearance of clozapine, methadone and phenytoin and reduce the activation of codeine and tamoxifen. Carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin can increase clearance of sertraline. |
| **vitamin A** | Deficiency in patients with chronic cholestasis: 5000–10 000 units/day PO (aqueous). Use the minimum effective dose |  | Mineral oil decreases absorption. |
| **vitamin D** | Deficiency in patients with chronic cholestasis: 1000 units Q2 days PO (with 2–3 g elemental calcium/day)​[b] |  | Mineral oil decreases absorption. |
| **vitamin K** | Deficiency in patients with chronic cholestasis: 10 mg monthly IM |  | Mineral oil decreases absorption.Antagonizes warfarin (decreases INR). |

| **prednisolone** (generics) | Autoimmune hepatitis: 60 mg/day PO × 1 wk, then 40 mg/day PO × 1 wk, then 30 mg/day PO × 2 wk, then 20 mg/day POGradually taper from 20 mg/day over weeks to months using serum aminotransferase levels and clinical status as a guideAlcohol-related hepatitis: 40 mg/day PO × 28 days; consider tapering over 1–2 wk post-therapy | Fluid/electrolyte imbalance, suppression of pituitary-adrenal function, hyperglycemia, peptic ulcer, behavioural disturbances, ocular cataracts, glaucoma, Cushing syndrome, aseptic necrosis of hip. Increases risk of infections. | Increased risk of GI ulceration with NSAIDs; decreased efficacy with barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampin; decreased effect of vaccines. |
| **budesonide** (Cortiment, Entocort) | Autoimmune hepatitis: Initial dose 9 mg/day, gradually tapering to 3 mg/day | May be similar to prednisolone/prednisone, but reduced intensity.Avoid in cirrhotic patients. | CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma levels of budesonide. |
| **azathioprine** (Imuran, generics) | Autoimmune hepatitis: 50–150 mg/day PO (may be used in conjunction with prednisone to decrease initial prednisone dose to 20 mg/day)TPMT testing is recommended on initiation of therapy​[b] | Decreased appetite, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (monitor CBC monthly), increased risk of atypical infections, biliary stasis, hypersensitivity reactions, rash, rare veno-occlusive disease, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis. | Toxic effects with allopurinol; therapy modification required. If used concomitantly, reduce azathioprine dose to one-third to one-quarter of the usual dose and monitor closely for toxicity (hematologic toxicity, nausea and vomiting). |
| **mycophenolate mofetil** (CellCept, Apo-Mycophenolate, other generics) | Autoimmune hepatitis: 500–1000 mg BID PO | Diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased risk of atypical infections. | Antacids, iron and cholestyramine decrease absorption of mycophenolate. |
