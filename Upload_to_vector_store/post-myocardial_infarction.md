#### Introduction

The term post-myocardial infarction applies to patients who have experienced either ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non–ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). While the early management differs, the long-term therapeutic goals are similar: returning patients to an ideal quality of life and preventing progression of disease and repeat infarction. For details on early management, see Acute Coronary Syndromes.

For patients with STEMI, initial acute reperfusion strategies consisting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy enable restoration of patency to the occluded culprit artery and offer improved prognosis compared to patients treated conservatively.​[^[1]] Primary PCI, with reperfusion to the culprit artery, should be the first-line therapy if it can be done in an expedient manner. In addition, angiography at primary PCI enables evaluation of the non-culprit arteries and preliminary assessment of left ventricular function. For those receiving thrombolytic therapy, early assessment of reperfusion success is imperative, as transfer for urgent angiography is indicated for failed reperfusion.​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Evidence suggests the need for early cardiac catheterization, even among those with successful reperfusion.​[^[4]] This is especially evident in individuals with large infarcts, where a pharmacoinvasive approach (transfer for angiography immediately after thrombolysis) prevents subsequent recurrent ischemia and infarction and allows early risk stratification.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] While STEMI requires more urgent upfront treatment, NSTEMI actually has higher long-term morbidity and mortality.​[^[7]] Accordingly, the need for risk stratification early after NSTEMI is essential. An “invasive approach” of early angiography with subsequent revascularization with PCI or coronary bypass surgery has been shown to reduce recurrent morbidity and mortality in high-risk NSTEMI patients.​[^[8]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

After MI, patients are at substantial risk for subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as nonfatal MI, death or stroke. Secondary prevention with several classes of drugs independently reduces incidence of MACE by approximately 25%​[^[13]] (see Table 1). An overview of individual agents is provided in Table 2.

| Drug Therapy | Relative Risk Reduction | 2-Year Event Rate(death, MI or stroke) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | — | 8% |
| ASA | 25% | 6% |
| Beta-blocker | 25% | 4.5% |
| Lipid lowering(reduce LDL-C by 1.5 mmol/L) | 30% | 3% |
| ACE inhibitor | 25% | 2.3% |
| Cumulative relative risk reduction if all 4 drugs are used | ≈75% |  |
| To calculate the cumulative risk reduction, a multiplicative scale was used. For example, 2 interventions, each reducing the risk of an event by 30%, would be expected to have about a 50% relative risk reduction (1 – [0.7 × 0.7]). No interactions in treatment effects were observed in trials, suggesting that the proportionate risk reduction of a specific drug in the presence or absence of other effective interventions would be expected to be similar. Smoking cessation lowers the risk of recurrent MI by about half after 2 years. In a smoker with vascular disease, quitting smoking and the use of the 4 preventive strategies could theoretically have a large potential benefit (approximately 80% relative risk reduction). |  |  |

#### Antiplatelet Agents

Myocardial infarction is a consequence of an acute plaque rupture, in which activated platelets play an integral role. Consequently, after reperfusion therapy, early inhibition of platelets with ASA and an adenosine P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is required to maintain vessel patency and prevent reinfarction.​[^[14]] Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is also required for prevention of acute occlusion of stents after PCI​[^[15]]​[^[16]] or in patients managed medically.​[^[17]] Long-term antiplatelet therapy is effective in preventing MACE.​[^[10]] Currently available P2Y12 inhibitory drugs include the thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel) and ticagrelor.

In patients who have received thrombolytic therapy for acute MI, clopidogrel or ticagrelor (if patient <75 y) can be used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] For most other infarct patients, the first-line P2Y12 inhibitor is either prasugrel or ticagrelor.​[^[19]]​[^[20]]

Irrespective of the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor, the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be at least 1 year after MI in patients with low bleeding risk.​[^[21]] Evidence suggests that in some patients, there may benefit from prolonging DAPT post-MI for up to 3 years beyond the first year. In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, cardiovascular benefit was shown from using a ticagrelor dose of 60 mg twice daily.​[^[22]] Data from the DAPT trial also suggests benefit of long-term therapy among higher-risk patients treated with clopidogrel or prasugrel.​[^[23]] The DAPT Risk Calculator may be used to select patients most likely to benefit from continuation of their P2Y12 inhibitor;​[^[24]]​[^[25]] however, this has to be weighed carefully against bleeding risk. In certain patients, e.g., those at a high risk of bleeding, earlier discontinuation of the P2Y12 inhibitor might be considered in consultation with the cardiologist. For other patients, high-risk anatomical or PCI features may dictate consideration for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy.

Another strategy to consider at 1 year is a combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with low dose aspirin at 81 mg. This combination was shown to be of benefit in the COMPASS study among patients with stable coronary disease.​[^[26]] This may specifically benefit patients also known to have peripheral vascular disease, or those considered at higher risk of stroke rather than MI.

#### Acetylsalicylic acid

ASA is the antiplatelet agent of choice for long-term secondary prevention due to its effectiveness and low cost. Indefinite therapy is indicated in all postinfarct patients; low-dose therapy (75–100 mg) is as effective as higher doses (300–325 mg).​[^[27]] Low-dose ASA is generally better tolerated, with lower bleeding risk.​[^[28]] ASA is used in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor when indicated (see Figure 1).

#### Clopidogrel

The thienopyridine clopidogrel continues to be commonly used after PCI. In MI patients receiving clopidogrel after PCI, a dose of 150 mg daily for the first 6 days has been shown to be superior and should be considered.​[^[17]]​[^[29]] A daily dose of 75 mg should be used after the initial 6 days of high-dose therapy or for those patients deemed not to require the initial high-dose therapy. For patients with ASA allergy, chronic clopidogrel therapy may be a substitute.

#### Prasugrel

Prasugrel is a thienopyridine with an active metabolite that binds irreversibly to the P2Y12 receptor. Prasugrel has a faster onset of action with increased potency in platelet inhibition compared to clopidogrel. In patients with MI undergoing PCI, prasugrel reduced MACE (2.2% absolute risk reduction [ARR]) compared to clopidogrel.​[^[19]] Current guidelines suggest prasugrel or ticagrelor as first-line agents after NSTEMI or STEMI.​[^[17]]​[^[30]] Increased bleeding has been associated with prasugrel among patients who are elderly (>75 y), have a history of stroke or TIA, or who have low body weight (<60 kg). Accordingly, guidelines suggest a reduced dose of prasugrel in patients ≥75 years of age or who weigh ≤60 kg.​[^[17]] Prasugrel should be avoided in patients with previous stroke or TIA. 

#### Ticagrelor

Ticagrelor, a cyclopentyl triazolopyrimidine, is a direct, reversible inhibitor of the P2Y12 receptor. It is more effective (1.9% ARR in death from vascular causes, MI or stroke) in acute coronary syndrome when compared to clopidogrel.​[^[20]] Ticagrelor is endorsed as first-line therapy in current guidelines.​[^[17]]​[^[30]] Bleeding is increased among patients treated medically or with PCI when compared to clopidogrel.​[^[20]] Dyspnea may occur in approximately 14% of patients treated with ticagrelor.​[^[20]] 

#### Beta-Blockers

In the absence of contraindications, consider this class of medication in all patients after STEMI or NSTEMI, as they have been proven to reduce MACE postinfarct.​[^[10]]​[^[30]] In particular, beta-blockers play a role in the reduction of reinfarction and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia in the early phase after infarction.​[^[31]] Beta-blockers should be started within a few days of infarction and dosage titrated to achieve a heart rate <70 bpm. However, IV beta-blockers should be used cautiously in the early acute phase, as they may contribute to hemodynamic instability in patients suffering large infarcts.​[^[31]] Avoid beta-blockers in patients with hypotension, bradycardia and active heart failure. Patients with reduced LV function derive significant benefit from beta-blockers, but should be monitored closely, especially in the postinfarction period. This benefit extends to those already treated with ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers can be stopped if side effects are present and if LV function is normal. They should be continued indefinitely in patients with LV dysfunction.

#### Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Pathway

#### ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors should be considered in all post-MI patients, especially in those with LV dysfunction (LVEF <40%), hypertension or diabetes mellitus.​[^[10]]​[^[30]] The relative benefits of ACE inhibitors are greater among those with LV dysfunction, as they play a role in LV remodelling post-MI. Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors reduces cardiovascular death and MI among those with atherosclerosis and multiple risk factors.​[^[32]] In patients with significant renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, avoid ACE inhibitors.​[^[10]] Titration to evidence-based dosages (see Table 2) is important and should be evaluated at follow-up visits.​[^[32]]​[^[33]] The development of a dry cough may require some patients to discontinue ACE inhibitors.

#### ARBs

ARBs may be used instead of ACE inhibitors in those intolerant of the latter because of cough. In a randomized control study, valsartan demonstrated equivalent benefit to captopril among post-MI patients with heart failure and LV dysfunction.​[^[34]] Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB increases adverse events and has no evidence of benefit.​[^[35]]

#### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

Consider using a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (aldosterone antagonist) in patients post-MI with significant LV dysfunction (EF ≤40%). Eplerenone, when added to other post-MI evidenced-based therapies, has demonstrated a reduction in mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular events (heart failure, re-infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia).​[^[36]] Similarly, spironolactone has been proven beneficial in patients with severe LV dysfunction when used in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic.​[^[37]] Comparative data are limited, so choice is based on tolerability and availability. Closely monitor electrolytes, as eplerenone and spironolactone are associated with a risk of hyperkalemia. 

#### HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

Starting a statin early after MI decreases both early and late adverse events. Guidelines suggest documenting the cholesterol profile within 24 hours of infarction, as LDL cholesterol may be falsely low for up to 4 weeks postinfarction.​[^[30]]​[^[38]] Evidence suggests that intensive treatment with higher-dose statins (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 40 mg/day) early after MI confers additional benefits compared with moderate dosages.​[^[39]] The benefit of statins extends beyond lowering of LDL cholesterol levels alone as they contribute to plaque stabilization by preventing future acute coronary syndromes.​[^[40]]

Indefinite continuation of statin therapy is integral to the prevention of ischemic events. Following MI, all patients are considered to be in the high-risk group for subsequent events.​[^[41]] Current Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines advocate a minimum target LDL-C of <1.8 mmol/L.​[^[41]] Muscle-related intolerance may be confirmed in up to 6% of patients.​[^[42]] In patients intolerant of statins, alternative cholesterol-lowering agents such as ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors may be considered (see Dyslipidemias). 

#### Oral Anticoagulants

Oral anticoagulants are recommended in post-MI patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or demonstrable LV thrombus (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).​[^[10]] Warfarin continues to be the oral anticoagulant of choice for patients with LV thrombus due to lack of evidence with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for this indication. DOACs should be the oral anticoagulant of choice for patients with atrial fibrillation when used with a P2Y12 inhibitor.​[^[45]]​[^[46]]​[^[47]]​[^[48]] In patients requiring a DOAC, consider early discontinuation of ASA, from as early as 1 day and up to 6 months after PCI.​[^[49]]

There is a significant increase in bleeding risk when warfarin is used concurrently with dual antiplatelet therapy.​[^[30]] This is of concern when combining prasugrel or ticagrelor with warfarin as there may be an even higher risk of bleeding compared to clopidogrel.​[^[43]] Accordingly, most patients receiving warfarin should use clopidogrel as the P2Y12 inhibitory drug. ASA should be discontinued early. Close monitoring of INR in these patients is imperative, with consideration of shorter duration of antiplatelet therapy if indefinite warfarin therapy is indicated. In those treated with warfarin for LV thrombus post-MI, a repeat echocardiography should be performed after 3 months of treatment.​[^[10]] If the thrombus has resolved, consider discontinuation of warfarin therapy. 



Guidelines suggest that DOACs might be considered as an alternative to warfarin when an anticoagulant and antiplatelet agent are used together.​[^[30]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]] In this situation, consider stopping ASA early (as early as day 1 or up to 6 months after PCI) with clopidogrel continued at the discretion of the treating physician.​[^[49]]​[^[50]] Experience with prasugrel or ticagrelor is limited at this point, so they are best avoided.​[^[49]]​[^[50]] Decision on a regimen should be individualized for each patient after consultation with the treating cardiologists.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Post-myocardial Infarction and Pregnancy

Myocardial infarction during the peripartum period is rare. However, if MI occurs in the peripartum period, a diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) should be considered as it is the most common cause of MI in pregnancy.​[^[52]] Risk factors for SCAD in pregnancy include multiparous, use of infertility therapies and pre-eclampsia.​[^[52]] In the largest registry of patients with SCAD, 4.7% of cases occurred during the peripartum period and 2.9% during breastfeeding.​[^[53]]

#### Management

SCAD is diagnosed with angiography, with the majority of these patients managed conservatively with medications rather than PCI or surgery. DAPT may confer some benefit in patients with SCAD, based on the presumed prothrombotic nature of intimal tears.​[^[54]] Beta-blockers similarly may provide benefit by reduction in shear stress. ACE inhibitors may be considered if there is significant LV dysfunction (≤40%). Statins would not be indicated in patients with SCAD, unless concurrent CAD is documented.

#### Post-myocardial Infarction and Breastfeeding

There has been concerning documentation of the onset of SCAD symptoms during lactation;​[^[52]] accordingly, continuation of breastfeeding should be done with careful consideration. For those with CAD rather than SCAD as a cause for MI, ASA and beta-blockers can be used at low doses in breastfeeding patients. However, if P2Y12 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors or statins are used, breastfeeding would not be recommended.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
