#### Introduction

Eating disorders include a variety of afflictions characterized by disturbed eating-related behaviours causing altered consumption of food and impairing health or function.​[^[1]] Among these disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder are addressed in this chapter.

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a distorted body image and excessive dieting that leads to severe weight loss and a pathological fear of becoming overweight. Although most patients with anorexia nervosa present initially as restricting type, many also exhibit binge/purge behaviours later in the course of the disease. Many patients will alternate between periods of restricting and bingeing/purging. Anorexia nervosa primarily affects adolescent and young females, but males can also be affected. (*Note: Studies presenting this finding classify patients as female or male. CPhA is aware these terms may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting and are not inclusive of all patients. Each patient should be considered individually.*)

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by frequent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting, to avoid weight gain. It typically presents in individuals within a normal or overweight range.

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by bingeing episodes during which individuals ingest large amounts of food and experience loss of control over their eating behaviour.

Patients with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) have poor nutrition and may restrict the quantity or variety of their food intake. The restriction is not motivated by body image or weight concerns, but rather by learned aversion. Aversion may be caused by specific sensory dislikes or negative emotions that previously occurred around the time of eating and may include fear of vomiting, choking or allergic reaction.  

See Table 1 for diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, Text Revision (DSM-5–TR).​[^[1]]

| Eating Disorder | Diagnostic Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Anorexia NervosaSpecify current severity:The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI) (see below) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in adults; for children and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision.Mild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m​2Moderate: BMI 16–16.99 kg/m​2Severe: BMI 15–15.99 kg/m​2Extreme: BMI < 15 kg/m​2 | Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.Coding note: The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype (see below).Specify whether:F50.01 Restricting type: During the last 3 months, the individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas). This subtype describes presentations in which weight loss is accomplished primary through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.F50.02 Binge-eating/purging type: During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas).Specify if:In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, Criteria A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape) is still met.In full remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. |
| Bulimia NervosaSpecify current severity:The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability.Mild: An average of 1–3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per weekModerate: An average of 4–7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per weekSevere: An average of 8–13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per weekExtreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week | Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2–hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances.A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.Specify if:In partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time.In full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. |
| Binge-Eating DisorderSpecify current severity:The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of episodes of binge eating (see below). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability.Mild: 1–3 binge-eating episodes per weekModerate: 4–7 binge-eating episodes per weekSevere: 8–13 binge-eating episodes per weekExtreme: 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week | Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2–hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances.A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).The binge eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:Eating much more rapidly than normal.Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry.Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating.Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.Specify if:In partial remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met, binge-eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one episode per week for a sustained period of time.In full remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. |
| Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder | An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) associated with one (or more) of the following:Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children).Significant nutritional deficiency.Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced.The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention.Specify if:In remission: After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time. |

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



Note that body weight corrected to height (BMI) is often used as a measure of adiposity but has several limitations. This classification system was created using data from White European males and is less accurate with respect to young adults who have not yet reached full growth, lean or muscular adults, adults over 65 years of age, and people of different races.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 lists drugs used in the management of anorexia nervosa.​[^[13]]

#### Prokinetic Agents

Food restriction and weight loss frequently lead patients with anorexia to experience gastroparesis. The prokinetic agents domperidone and metoclopramide can reduce the feeling of fullness caused by decreased intestinal motility during the early stages of feeding.​[^[14]] Unless the antinauseant effect of metoclopramide is needed, domperidone is the preferred agent because it has a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. 

On rare occasions when the feeling of fullness is limiting a patient’s treatment, and domperidone or metoclopramide is not effective, consider switching to erythromycin (must be compounded; available only in powder form in Canada) or azithromycin.​[^[13]]​[^[15]]​[^[16]] Note, however, that tachyphylaxis develops to the motility effects of these antibiotics after 1–4 weeks of use.​[^[13]]

Prokinetic agents have the potential to cause QTc prolongation, especially in patients taking other QTc—prolonging drugs, or with other risk factors such as hypokalemia or hypoglycemia.​[^[13]]​[^[17]] An ECG might be indicated prior to initiation and after dose adjustments. If domperidone is used, the QTc should be measured before and 1 week after the start of the therapy. If the QTc increases by greater than 50 msec, domperidone should be discontinued. 

Constipation is also a frequent problem associated with weight loss. Prucalopride is a newer serotonin-4 (5–HT4) receptor agonist that can help normalize colonic function and treat constipation in patients with anorexia nervosa.​[^[18]] Unlike previously marketed 5-HT4 agonists, prucalopride does not act at other receptors or cause cardiac complications associated with a prolonged QTc interval. 

#### Other Therapies

In patients with anorexia nervosa, zinc **gluconate** can increase the rate of weight gain irrespective of the serum zinc measurement.​[^[19]] Nausea affects about 2% of patients who take oral zinc; taking with food reduces this adverse effect.

The second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine has been shown in some clinical trials to decrease delusional thinking, anorexic rumination and obsessionality in low doses (2.5–10 mg daily). This may result in improved motivation and weight gain, even in chronic anorexia nervosa.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] However, not all trials showed this psychological benefit.​[^[20]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Completion rates and adherence were also low in some trials.​[^[20]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Weight gain with olanzepine treatment was either modest or did not differ from placebo; thus, it appears that olanzapine in anorexia patients does not cause the rapid weight gain it is known to cause in people of normal weight.​[^[13]]​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] This is important because patients with anorexia nervosa would not use the medication if weight gain were rapid. 

Olanzapine should not be used long term unless the benefits outweigh the risk of developing a movement disorder as an adverse effect. Duration of therapy is approximately 3–4 months and to a maximum BMI of 17 kg/m​[^2], until it is no longer needed for weight gain.​[^[27]] Olanzapine can cause metabolic effects such as dyslipidemia. Diabetes due to reduced insulin sensitivity is also a potential adverse effect, but has not been observed in this patient group to date.

Cyproheptadine at bedtime may be useful, particularly in chronic anorexia nervosa. It may cause modest weight gain and can be used as a hypnotic.​[^[28]]​[^[29]]

Benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) lack demonstrable efficacy for treatment of anxiety in anorexia nervosa and carry a risk of misuse.​[^[8]] If severe anxiety is present, see Anxiety Disorders. Take care to avoid dependence (see Benzodiazepines (CPhA Monograph)). The second-generation antipsychotic quetiapine is often used to manage anxiety in this setting. It is more effective than benzodiazepines and less likely to be associated with dependence.​[^[30]]​[^[31]] Use quetiapine with caution, as it may increase anxiety due to a sense of loss of control, or produce withdrawal symptoms if used long term.​[^[32]]​[^[33]] It may also cause extrapyramidal side effects because it is often used on a sliding scale with extra doses for marked anxiety.

SSRI antidepressants such as fluoxetine should be used only for coexistent depression, purge behaviour or anxiety disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and if cardiac status is stable (e.g., QTc less than 450 msec; see Bulimia Nervosa, Antidepressants).​[^[34]]

Give thiamine at the beginning of feeding to prevent the development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (encephalopathy).

Ondansetron is not commonly used in controlling nausea or vomiting associated with eating disorders.​[^[35]]​[^[36]]

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Bulimia Nervosa

#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 2 illustrates the management of bulimia nervosa. Patients should also be assessed and treated for suicidal ideation and depression.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 4 lists drugs used in the management of bulimia nervosa.

#### Antidepressants

 Antidepressants are effective in reducing binge-eating episodes by ≥50% in two-thirds of patients. SSRIs, venlafaxine or trazodone can be used; however, fluoxetine is recommended as it is supported by the most evidence.​[^[8]]​[^[20]]​[^[51]]​[^[52]]​[^[53]] There is no correlation between the presence of comorbid depression and the antibulimic effects of the antidepressant, nor is there any evidence that one antidepressant is more effective than another.​[^[54]] Trazodone can be useful in patients with insomnia associated with bulimia nervosa.​[^[20]] Due to toxicity and poor adherence, TCAs and MAOIs should not be prescribed.​[^[20]] Bupropion is contraindicated as it has been associated with an increased risk of seizure in patients with eating disorders.​[^[8]] If therapy is effective, continue for at least 6 months, and preferably 1 year. 

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Binge-Eating Disorder

#### Therapeutic Choices

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is diagnosed when a patient has recurrent episodes of eating excessive amounts of food. These are associated with a feeling of loss of control but relief from stress during the binge and with increased anxiety and decreased self-esteem following the binge (see Table 1).

BED occurs in all genders and is more common in patients in their 30s. It is usually a chronic condition that goes unreported by the patient due to shame. In some patients, it leads to or worsens obesity. BED is a type of addiction and is more common in those with a family history of addictions.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] Patients with BED may report an association between stress, time of day and time of cycle (if menstruating) with the binge.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]

BED, distinct from bulimia nervosa, has no compensatory behaviour that follows the binge that would reduce weight gain. Figure 3 illustrates the management of BED.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy in increasing binge-eating abstinence. They also effectively reduce binge-eating frequency and eating-related obsessions and compulsions.​[^[59]] SSRIs may be beneficial in patients with concomitant mood disorders. SSRIs have been shown to be ineffective for weight loss.​[^[60]] Fluoxetine may be advantageous as it is generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects.​[^[60]]

#### Amphetamine-Based Agents

Lisdexamfetamine is the only medication approved by Health Canada for the treatment of BED. Systematic reviews have shown its efficacy in reducing binge-eating frequency and binge-eating-related obsessions and compulsions.​[^[61]] Additionally, it has been shown to reduce weight and appetite.​[^[61]] Lisdexamfetamine is well tolerated in patients with BED and offers the flexibility of gradual titration due to its broad dosing spectrum.

#### Anticonvulsants

Topiramate has been suggested by some authors and in clinical guidelines as a potential treatment for binge-eating disorder.​[^[8]]​[^[20]]​[^[62]]​[^[63]] It has shown efficacy for weight loss and reducing binge-eating frequency in clinical trials and a systematic review.​[^[8]]​[^[20]]​[^[62]] However, withdrawal rates in the trials were high.​[^[8]]​[^[62]] Furthermore, patients receiving topiramate experienced significantly more side effects, particularly cognitive difficulties and depression, compared to placebo.​[^[8]]​[^[62]] The use of topiramate is therefore not recommended.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

#### Therapeutic Choices

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterized by avoidance of certain foods. This may depend on the texture, taste, smell or remembered associations of the food. Although many children and adults are “picky eaters,” if the food avoidance compromises health, emotional or social well-being, it may be ARFID.​[^[64]] For example, teenagers often seek treatment for ARFID if their food avoidance compromises their social life. Figure 4 illustrates the management of ARFID.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Assess and treat the associated health, emotional and social status of the patient. Deficiencies should be corrected if present. Iron, zinc, B12, folate and vitamin C deficiencies are most important as they can alter appetite, mood, energy levels, taste and food preference.​[^[65]] Serum zinc is not a good measure of brain zinc; therefore, an oral supplement should be tried if the diet is deficient. This is often the case with a diet that is low in red meat or dairy products.​[^[65]]​[^[66]]

Concurrent psychological disorders should be treated. Sources of stress, such as family dysfunction, school or work, should be ameliorated as well.

CBT is a commonly used treatment for ARFID. CBT strategies focus on decreasing food avoidance, increasing food exposure, and targeting cognitions underlying the diet restrictions, such as fear of vomiting or choking. CBT interventions can include goal setting, psychoeducation, self-monitoring, graded food exposure and anxiety management. Studies have shown that CBT may improve various outcomes in ARFID, including weight gain, nutritional intake and variety of accepted foods.​[^[67]]

Desensitization to the avoided food is of primary importance. To desensitize, begin with the least aversive foods. If texture is important, gradually prolong the presence of the food on the tongue or mix foods of different textures. If taste or smell is of concern, use very small amounts or mix the food with other foods or condiments.​[^[66]]​[^[68]] Desensitization should be done in a relaxing environment. Methods of distraction can be incorporated. For example, the patient could talk with family at mealtimes without focusing on eating, or eat with friends at a party or event.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Medications should be used to treat co-occurring conditions like OCD (see Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), anxiety disorders (see Anxiety Disorders) or major depressive disorder (see Depression). ARFID is more common in children with autism spectrum disorder.​[^[69]]

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Eating Disorders and Pregnancy

Amenorrheic patients with anorexia nervosa may ovulate and, unless effective contraception is used, pregnancy can occur.​[^[72]]​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]] Medications, including oral contraceptives, may be missed, vomited or not absorbed.​[^[77]]

Eating disorder symptoms improve during pregnancy in two-thirds of cases, but worsen in one-third.​[^[78]]​[^[79]]​[^[80]]​[^[81]]​[^[82]] Patients with eating disorders have a higher reported prevalence of some pregnancy-related complications. These may include preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm birth, cesarean delivery, small or large for gestational age babies and perinatal death.​[^[83]]​[^[84]]​[^[85]] They also have a higher risk of anxiety and depression during pregnancy and postpartum.​[^[83]]​[^[84]]​[^[86]] However, in most patients with eating disorders, the delivery is usually normal and the newborn is healthy.​[^[85]]​[^[87]]

Note that children of parents with eating disorders are often aware of the disorder and may take on a caregiver’s role within the first few years of life. They also have an increased likelihood of developing disordered eating and body image themselves.​[^[88]]

#### Management



#### Eating Disorders and Breastfeeding

If the eating disorder (particularly anorexia nervosa) is classified as severe, breast milk production can be affected. Nevertheless, most patients with eating disorders can successfully breastfeed their babies. Refer breastfeeding patients with eating disorders to a dietitian to optimize maternal and infant nutrition.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices. Specific guidance on the use of antidepressant, antipsychotic and prokinetic agents during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Depression, Schizophrenia and Related Psychotic Disorders and Nausea and Vomiting respectively.

Inducers of CYP1A2, such as carbamazepine, rifampin or cigarette smoking, may decrease olanzapine serum concentrations; conversely, quitting smoking may necessitate a dose reduction to avoid toxicity.Inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as ciprofloxacin or ketoconazole, may increase effects and toxicity of olanzapine.Caution re: other drugs with potential EPS such as metoclopramide; avoid concurrent use. |
| **quetiapine** (Seroquel, generics) | Anxiety | 12.5–50 mg before meals and at bedtime POUsed to manage severe anxiety in this setting | Drowsiness, EPS effects, QTc prolongation. | Increased hypotension with antihypertensives; additive sedation with CNS depressants, including alcohol; inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluoxetine or ketoconazole, can increase the effects and toxicity of quetiapine.Caution with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. |
| **prucalopride** (Resotran, generics) | Constipation, intestinal motility | Initial: 2 mg daily PO; decrease if possible to 1 mg daily PO after 1–2 months | Abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, nausea. | Monitor therapy if combined with p-glycoprotein inhibitors such as erythromycin, ketoconazole, verapamil, cyclosporine; may increase prucalopride serum concentration and adverse effects.Prucalopride-induced diarrhea may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives. |
| **azithromycin** (Zithromax, generics) | Intestinal motility (if domperidone or metoclopramide are ineffective) | 250 mg daily PO | Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, rash, prolonged QTc interval, dysrhythmias. | Caution with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval.May inhibit p-glycoprotein and increase adverse effects of substrates; use caution if using concurrently with a p-glycoprotein substrate (e.g., colchicine, cyclosporine, digoxin).Does not have significant CYP-related interactions. |
| **domperidone** (generics) | Intestinal motility | 10–20 mg 30 min before meals POMay also be given at bedtime to deal with residual food ingested in eveningMaximum: 30 mg/day | Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, hyperprolactinemia, drowsiness; can prolong QTc interval. | Opioids and antimuscarinics may antagonize action of domperidone in the gut. Caution with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. |
| **erythromycin** (generics) | Intestinal motility (if domperidone or metoclopramide are ineffective) | 125 mg BID PO​[b] | Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, prolonged QTc interval, dysrhythmias. | Inhibitor of CYP1A2 and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4; may increase effect and toxicity of substrates of these isoenzymes such as isotretinoin, mirtazapine, morphine, oxycodone, quetiapine, theophylline, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine.Caution with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. |
| **metoclopramide** (generics) | Intestinal motility, nausea | 5–20 mg 30 min before meals PO | Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, hyperprolactinemia, drowsiness, restlessness; can prolong QTc interval. Can cause EPS (rare). | Potentiates effects of other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Caution with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval.Additive risk of EPS with antipsychotics; avoid concurrent use. |
| **zinc gluconate** (generics) | Weight gain promotion | 100 mg daily PO with meals for 2 months | Nausea; can cause a copper deficiency if taken in excess for months. | Zinc may reduce the serum concentration and efficacy of tetracycline; tetracycline doses should be taken 2–3 h before zinc. |
| **thiamine** (generics) | Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome prevention | 100 mg daily IM × 5 days at start of refeeding | None expected. | None known. |
