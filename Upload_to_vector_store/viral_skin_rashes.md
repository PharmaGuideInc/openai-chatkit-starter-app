#### Introduction

Viral infections are frequently associated with the development of exanthems (eruptive skin rash), especially in the pediatric population. These exanthems are often nonspecific and lack characteristic features. Viral exanthems can mimic drug-induced rashes, making it difficult to differentiate a rash of viral origin from a drug reaction.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] In contrast, viral skin infections are generally more likely to present with erythematous-vesicular patterns and be accompanied by mucous membrane involvement, compared with rashes caused by bacteria, fungi or drugs, which are more likely to present with erythematous-pustular patterns.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] As well, many of the viral exanthems are associated with low-grade fever, myalgias, headache, rhinorrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms (see Table 1). When examining a patient with a potential viral exanthem, it is important to note the age of the patient, any sick contacts, recent travel history, recent antibiotic use and associated symptoms (e.g., prodromal symptoms).​[^[2]]​[^[5]] 

This chapter addresses the following topics: rubeola; rubella; erythema infectiosum (parvovirus infection/fifth disease); roseola infantum (sixth disease); Gianotti-Crosti syndrome; hand, foot and mouth disease; and COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations. For more information, see Herpesvirus Infections (for chickenpox and shingles) and Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis) (for herpes labialis). Other viral eruptions (e.g., mpox,​[^[6]] Zika virus​[^[7]]​[^[8]]) are not discussed.​[^[5]]

#### Pathophysiology

Characteristics of selected viral skin rashes can be found in Table 2.

#### Rubeola (Measles)

Measles vaccination resulted in a 79% drop in measles-associated deaths between 2000 and 2014 worldwide.​[^[9]] However, between 2021 and 2022, there was an increase in measles cases by 18% and deaths from measles increased by 43%, from 95 000 to 136 200.​[^[10]] In Canada, secondary spread is mainly due to individuals who are still vulnerable due to inadequate vaccination (see Routine Childhood Vaccinations).​[^[11]] Measles virus (paramyxovirus) is spread primarily via respiratory droplets. Koplik spots, which are small grey-blue specks on an erythematous base in lighter skin and may be more subtle in darker skin, may appear on the buccal mucosa during the prodromal period but disappear within 48 hours after the onset of rash. They are generally diagnostic for measles although they may be associated with the human parvovirus B19 (erythema infectiosum). Two to 3 days after Koplik spots appear, a maculopapular eruption appears on the scalp, face and neck that spreads downwards. In lighter skin, the rash typically appears purplish-red, while in darker skin, it may appear more subtly. See photos, Rubeola (Measles). Complications of measles most often include otitis media and rarely bronchopneumonia, encephalitis, myocarditis and pericarditis.​[^[12]] Acute encephalitis, which can lead to permanent brain damage, occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1000 individuals infected with measles. In addition, 1 to 3 out of every 1000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.​[^[13]]

#### Rubella (German Measles)

Routine rubella vaccination programs (as part of MMR vaccine) have led to rubella now being considered a rare disease.​[^[14]] Although the prodrome and skin eruption are milder than in typical measles, rubella has devastating effects on the developing fetus if contracted during the first trimester of pregnancy. Illness among children is generally milder than among adults, with fewer prodromal symptoms and complications. The most common features of congenital rubella syndrome are sensorineural deafness, cataracts, congenital heart disease and CNS abnormalities.​[^[15]] It can also cause miscarriage or stillbirth. Additionally, polyarthritis and polyarthralgia may develop in approximately 60–70% of adolescent and adult patients about 1 week after the rash.​[^[16]] The rubella virus (RNA togavirus) is spread by respiratory droplets.​[^[17]]

#### Erythema Infectiosum (Parvovirus Infection/Fifth Disease)

Erythema infectiosum is a childhood exanthem caused by human parvovirus B19 and thought to be spread by respiratory droplet secretions. It is most common between 4 and 10 years of age and is seen usually in the winter and spring.​[^[5]]​[^[18]] Over 50% of infections are asymptomatic. The eruption occurs in 3 stages:

#### Roseola Infantum (Exanthema Subitum/Sixth Disease)

Roseola infantum is a skin rash caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) or 7 (HHV-7). The mode of transmission of roseola is unknown. After an incubation period of 5–15 days, children present with a high fever (sometimes >40°C) that lasts approximately 3–5 days and possibly mild cough, rhinorrhea or diarrhea, but often otherwise appear well.​[^[22]] Febrile convulsions occur in approximately 10% of patients. Rapid defervescence is followed by the onset of a rash, which begins on the chest and may spread to the neck and extremities before generalizing into a pink (in lighter skin) or hyperpigmented (in darker skin) maculopapular eruption that lasts 24–48 hours; the rash is observed only in approximately 20% of infected patients.​[^[5]] Most infections occur between 6 months and 3 years of age, with a peak at 6–7 months.​[^[19]]​[^[24]] A common, acute, self-limiting exanthematous viral disease called pityriasis rosea is associated with endogenous reactivation of HHV-6 and/or HHV-7.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]

#### Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome (Papular Acrodermatitis of Childhood)

The skin eruption of Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is characterized by a sudden onset of erythematous, flat-topped papules usually symmetrically distributed on the face, buttocks and extremities of children. It usually affects children 6 months–12 years of age with peak occurrence at 1–6 years of age.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] The trunk is usually spared and the lesions are most commonly nonpruritic. The eruption is self-limiting, with spontaneous resolution in 3 weeks. Associated extracutaneous features may include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and occasionally splenomegaly. The eruption is mainly triggered by viral infections including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus. As well, various immunizations such as influenza, diphtheria and measles have been associated with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome.​[^[27]] See photos, Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome.

#### Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease

Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by enteroviruses, mostly coxsackie A16. Although the virus primarily affects infants and children <10 years of age, it can also rarely occur in adults.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread by contact with secretions from the nose and throat, saliva, fluid from blisters, or feces of an infected person.​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Following an absent or mild prodrome (including low-grade fever, malaise and sore throat),​[^[37]] lesions appear in the oral mucosa and affect the palms and soles; involvement of the buttocks/perineum may also be observed.​[^[30]] Vesiculopustules, which appear grey-white in lighter skin and may be less pronounced in darker skin, are often asymptomatic, although oral lesions may be painful. The incubation period of hand, foot and mouth disease is 4–6 days with a high rate of contagion. Neurological or cardiopulmonary complications may occur. See photo, Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of human skin with several raised, round lesions. These lesions appear to be dome-shaped and have a central indentation, which is characteristic of molluscum contagiosum. The surrounding skin appears normal, without significant redness or swelling. The lesions are evenly distributed across the visible area of the skin. This presentation is typical of a viral skin infection that is often seen in children but can occur in adults as well.

#### COVID-19 Cutaneous Manifestations

The prevalence of cutaneous eruptions secondary to COVID-19 infection is between 4–20%.​[^[31]]​[^[32]] There are a variety of different skin manifestations that have been identified, including maculopapular eruptions, urticarial eruptions, vesicular eruptions and pernio (chilblain)-like acral lesions.​[^[31]] Additionally, in children, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described, which includes a nonexudative conjunctivitis, polymorphic rash, oral mucositis, hand and foot anomalies, and perineal and facial desquamation.​[^[32]] Dermatologic manifestations may be related to the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors in the skin, a cytokine storm released by the immune system or reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or HHV-6.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] COVID-19–induced eruptions can arise simultaneously or following the respiratory illness or they may be the main presentation of asymptomatic patients.​[^[34]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

An assessment for pediatric patients with a skin eruption is found in Figure 1. Prior to recommending a product for symptomatic relief, evaluate the severity of the patient’s condition. 

Patients require further assessment by an appropriate health-care practitioner when:



Note that many other eruptions induced by viral infections (e.g., herpes simplex, eruptions associated with respiratory and enteric viruses) are not included in Figure 1.

#### Prevention

Hand hygiene is one of the most effective methods of preventing transmission of pathogens. As many viral skin rashes are spread via respiratory droplets, respiratory hygiene (cough etiquette) should also be used to help prevent transmission. High-risk patients, such as those with cancer or HIV infection, should avoid exposure to patients with viral skin eruptions.

Vaccines have been developed for the prevention of **measles**, **mumps** and **rubella**. For current immunization schedule recommendations, see the Canadian Immunization Guide​[^[38]] as well as provincial and territorial immunization schedules.​[^[39]] All patients of child-bearing age should be tested for rubella antibodies and vaccinated if necessary prior to pregnancy. For further information on childhood vaccination, see Routine Childhood Vaccinations.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Minimizing patient discomfort is key, and often the only treatment that can be offered to patients with a viral skin eruption.

Cool compresses (e.g., gauze or other thin cloth moistened with water) applied for 20 minutes 4–6 times daily can be used, especially for weeping, oozing lesions.

Some viral skin eruptions are associated with intense pruritus. Since it is exacerbated by dry skin, using a simple emollient is often helpful. A humidifier can also be used, although in some patients high humidity may also cause pruritus secondary to sweat retention. Recommend good hygiene practices including gentle cleansing and drying of lesions as well as trimming of fingernails to prevent bacterial infection that may develop from scratching the pruritic lesions. The sensation of itching is generally increased if the skin is warm. Therefore, cooling the skin by tepid showering or bathing can often bring relief. As well, rubbing an ice cube over the rash (but not allowing the ice to sit in one spot on the skin) or covering the rash with a clean cloth soaked in cold water will provide temporary relief.

Avoiding factors that may enhance pruritus, such as wearing of tight elasticized apparel or coarse woolen fabrics, is also important. Cornstarch or sodium bicarbonate baths have been used to relieve itching in patients with chickenpox. Add 2 cups of cornstarch mixed with 4 cups of water to a bathtub full of water. Bathing is recommended once or twice daily for approximately 15–20 minutes. The skin should be gently patted, not rubbed, when drying.

Remind patients to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, which can include popsicles and gelatin.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, see Analgesic Products: External Analgesics; Skin Care Products: Dermatitis and Dry Skin, First Aid. 

Colloidal oatmeal bath preparations may help to relieve pruritus. To be effective, the product should be well dispersed in the bathtub water. For dispersion, the patient should fill a strainer with oatmeal bath preparation and hold it under the faucet as water fills the tub. After bathing, and while skin is slightly damp, unscented moisturizing cream or white petrolatum should be applied to the skin to retard water evaporation.

Topical agents are useful for relieving pruritus and for reducing bacterial colonization of damaged skin. Calamine **lotion** can be applied. Other traditional topical agents including menthol, camphor and phenol are no longer recommended. Concern has been raised over possible phenol toxicity, which has been described in patients with extensive bullous poison ivy who developed renal toxicity.​[^[40]] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that camphor not be used in children due to adverse effects associated with even minor systemic absorption.​[^[41]] 

**Local anesthetics** block conduction along axonal membranes, thereby relieving itching as well as pain. However, topical local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine) are not recommended due to risk of sensitization, especially if applied to broken or fissured skin.​[^[42]] Additionally, oral benzocaine products (including teething products) should not be used in children under 2 years of age.​[^[43]] Pramoxine has less risk of sensitization than other local anesthetics and may be used topically as an antipruritic.

Topical  corticosteroids may relieve the itching associated with the skin lesions but are not frequently used, as most viral-induced skin eruptions are self-limiting and topical corticosteroids do not improve the natural history of the disease. Mild topical corticosteroids, such as 0.5 or 1% hydrocortisone, can be used on the face and intertriginous folds. Ointments are more occlusive and are preferred for dry or scaly lesions, whereas creams are used in moist areas since they are more drying. Lotions are useful for the scalp and other hairy areas or for application to large body areas. Topical corticosteroids should not be used on bacterial- or fungal-infected skin since the corticosteroid may mask the symptoms of the dermatologic infection and allow the infection to progress. If the skin lesions persist or worsen after 5–7 days of topical corticosteroid therapy, the patient should seek further assessment and/or treatment. Systemic corticosteroids have been reported effective in severe cases.​[^[44]] For further discussion on the use of topical corticosteroids, see Atopic Dermatitis.

Although H1-blocking antihistamines have been used for the treatment of pruritus especially associated with urticaria, they are often not effective for viral-induced skin lesions. However, sedating or first-generation antihistamines are often used at bedtime to improve sleep.​[^[45]] See Allergic Rhinitis for adult and pediatric doses of oral antihistamines. Topical diphenhydramine is usually not recommended because of the risk of sensitization resulting in contact dermatitis.​[^[45]]

Many viral diseases are associated with fever, especially in the prodromal stages. **Antipyretics** can be recommended to provide symptomatic relief; however, they do not reduce risk of recurrent febrile seizures.​[^[46]] See Fever for adult and pediatric doses of antipyretics.

Avoid ASA because of the possible association of Reye syndrome with salicylate administration​[^[47]] especially in children and teenagers with viral infections.​[^[48]] Reye syndrome is an acute, noninflammatory encephalopathy and hepatotoxicity that follows an acute viral illness.​[^[49]] In some countries, ASA use is still recommended in children. Parents who travel abroad should be warned regarding this potential risk.​[^[50]]

For patients with mouth lesions, recommend warm water rinses or **saline rinses** (5–15 mL of table salt in 125–250 mL of warm tap water). **Hydrogen peroxide** (half-strength) has also been used as a mouth rinse. Frequent oral hygiene with a soft-bristled toothbrush is recommended. Patients should avoid alcohol- and glycerin-based mouthwashes; petrolatum jelly can be applied to lips as needed.

**Vitamin A** therapy has been shown to decrease morbidity associated with rubeola. The WHO recommends vitamin A therapy for 2 days for all children with acute measles, regardless of their country of residence.​[^[51]]​[^[52]] The dosage of vitamin A administered once daily for 2 days is dependent on the age of the child: infants <6 months of age, 50 000 units daily; infants 6-11 months, 100 000 units daily; children ≥12 months, 200 000 units.​[^[52]]

For further information on topical therapy for viral skin rashes, see Table 4.

#### Natural Health Products

Although witch hazel (hamamelis water) has traditionally been used for itchy skin and other skin inflammatory conditions, bruises and hemorrhoids, clinical data to support its efficacy in these conditions are limited.​[^[53]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

A monitoring plan for patients with viral rashes is outlined in Table 3. Additional advice should be provided regarding the time frame during which patients are considered infectious (see Table 2).

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pruritus associated with skin eruption | Patient: daily while on therapy Health-care practitioner: after 2 days of therapy or next pharmacy visit | Decrease itching within 24–48 h | If therapy ineffective after 24–48 h and treatment still required, patient requires further assessment. |
| Fever | Patient: BID while on therapy Health-care practitioner: after 2 days or next visit | Decrease fever within 4–6 h of antipyretic administration | If fever persists for more than 48 h, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Pain | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: within 24 h of initiating therapy | Decrease pain to acceptable levels for the patient within 24 h | If pain persists despite appropriate analgesic medication, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Sedation (due to antihistamine therapy; this may be a desired effect of therapy) | Patient: daily Health-care practitioner: after 3 days or next visit | No sedation, especially if patient driving or using heavy machinery |  |

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart designed to assist in diagnosing skin rashes and lesions. It guides healthcare practitioners through a series of questions to determine the possible cause of a patient's skin condition. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Assess the patient for:
     - Description, severity, and distribution of skin lesion(s)
     - Onset, frequency, and duration of symptoms
     - Associated systemic symptoms, including fever
     - Medication history
     - Vaccination history
     - Attempted treatment
     - History of contact with an infectious person

2. **Decision Point: Is the reaction possibly drug-induced?**
   - **Yes:** 
     - Review of medical history, records, and clinical tests to support a drug-induced cause.
   - **No:** 
     - Proceed to the next decision point.

3. **Decision Point: Does the patient have a fever?**
   - **Yes:**
     - **Blisters on face, chest, and/or back?**
       - **Yes:** Possible varicella (chickenpox)
     - **Red or hyperpigmented rash covering the cheeks?**
       - **Yes:** Possible erythema infectiosum (fifth disease)
     - **Cough and red or hyperpigmented, raised rash on forehead and face, then spreading downward?**
       - **Yes:** Possible measles
     - **Rash appeared after the fever subsided?**
       - **Yes:** Possible roseola infantum
     - **Rash started on the face and neck, then progressed over the whole body?**
       - **Yes:** Possible rubella (German measles)
     - **Grey-white vesiculopustules on the palms and soles?**
       - **Yes:** Possible hand, foot, and mouth disease
   - **No:**
     - **Red or hyperpigmented blisters in a dermatomal distribution that are extremely painful?**
       - **Yes:** Possible herpes zoster (shingles)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Patient requires assessment by an appropriate healthcare practitioner.
   - Recommend self-care measures for symptomatic relief.

This flowchart helps in differentiating between various infectious and non-infectious causes of skin rashes based on symptoms and patient history.
