#### Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder worldwide.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]] It can impact any joint, but typically occurs in the spine (cervical or lumbar spine facet joints), hands, hips or knees. Hip and knee OA are ranked as the eleventh-highest contributors to global disability.​[^[5]]

Primary OA is idiopathic and is often seen in the elderly. Secondary OA is generally the result of an “insult” to the joint, e.g., trauma, post-trauma joint malalignment or joint infection. Other causes of secondary OA include rheumatoid arthritis, gout, congenital joint abnormalities and hematologic genetic disorders (leukemia). Osteoarthritis is often incorrectly referred to as a degenerative disorder, but is actually a condition with definite biochemical and inflammatory changes within the cartilage matrix, the joint cavity, the joint capsule and support structures.​[^[7]]​[^[8]] Patients with OA suffer mostly from pain, stiffness, discomfort and joint function impairment. A systematic review found that pain and loss of function in OA often remained stable over time; however, low education level, high BMI and high number of comorbidities were more commonly associated with worsening of symptoms.​[^[9]]

#### Goals of Therapy



All of the above goals may be achievable with appropriate early intervention.

#### Investigations

Osteoarthritis is most commonly identified by joint signs and symptoms and confirmed by diagnostic imaging, if necessary.



#### Therapeutic Choices

A treatment algorithm for OA is presented in Figure 1.

See Suggested Readings for OA treatment guidelines, although guidelines should not replace clinical judgment.

#### Risk Factors and Prevention

Strategies for prevention or delay of disease involve advice on general health, exercise and nutrition, weight management, and avoidance of repeated trauma to a potentially affected joint.

Knee malalignment valgus (knock knee) and knee varus (outward knee bending) are recognized as independent risk factors for development of knee OA.​[^[12]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Nonpharmacologic options are important in the management of OA and in improving quality of life. Multidisciplinary-care teams including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists, family members and caregivers play an important role in the treatment of a patient with OA. Patient education is also vital in that it leads to improved pain management.​[^[13]] Advise patients of online courses and educational sessions offered by the Arthritis Society. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be considered in patients with OA.​[^[14]]

#### Weight Loss



#### Exercise and Physiotherapy



Some patients may benefit from transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS); however, the effectiveness of TENS has not been established.​[^[14]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]] Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has been found to have some beneficial effect on pain relief and physical function; however, more studies are required to determine the appropriate frequency and dosage of ESWT.​[^[42]]

#### Orthotics and Aids to Daily Living



#### Surgery

Arthroplasty is an option for patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee and hip with unremitting symptomatology despite adherence to conservative medical management. In the majority of patients, hip and knee arthroplasties result in improvement in both pain and functional status.​[^[50]] Whether joint arthroplasty should be done early or late in the course of OA is heavily debated; however, quality of life must be a significant consideration in favour of early surgical intervention. Loss of function can lead to obesity, worsening OA, and the development or exacerbation of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.​[^[51]] Possible complications include loosening of the prostheses (osteolysis) and postoperative infection.​[^[52]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]] A common concern with early surgical intervention is the risk of revision surgery. However, a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports estimates that hip and total knee replacement surgeries could be expected to last for 25 years in 58% and 82% of patients respectively.​[^[55]]​[^[56]] The authors are in favour of early surgical intervention in the interest of improved quality of life.

Patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasties are at an elevated risk of DVT, and postoperative prophylaxis with pharmacologic agents is recommended. See Venous Thromboembolism for pharmacologic options used for the prevention of DVT.

With the advent of 3D printing, a significant leap in customizing total hip and knee prostheses has developed. These customized components mirror the patients’ original biometric configuration and allow for the true patient joint curve to be reproduced. Customized joint replacement parts are produced from a CT scan of the joint and lower extremity, which is then used to form a true 3D copy of the knee, and from this, the cutting jigs and joint replacement components are shaped. The components give optimal coverage and bone contact due to their customized dimensions, thus making them potentially more stable and possibly giving them a longer in situ life span.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]

Osteotomy can reduce pain and improve knee function by reducing load in selected patients with medial joint line (compartment) knee OA.​[^[59]] 

Athroscopic joint lavage and joint débridement are of questionable value.​[^[60]] 

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Standard pharmacological OA management involves a stepwise approach consisting of initial use of topical analgesics, followed by oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and injectable agents. Notwithstanding the side effect profile of anti-inflammatory agents, a detailed review of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis supports the concept that oral and injectable anti-inflammatory agents are the most important pharmaceutical agents in the management of osteoarthritis pain and function.​[^[61]]

#### Topical Analgesics

Topical analgesics are a treatment option for hand or knee OA, with the potential for a reduced risk of side effects compared to oral therapy.​[^[62]] Topical NSAIDs may be especially useful in at-risk groups including the elderly, who are at an increased risk of GI, renal, cardiovascular and other NSAID adverse effects.

Topical diclofenac has comparable efficacy to oral NSAIDs for relief of hand and knee pain due to osteoarthritis when used for a 6–12 week duration in 10–20% of people.​[^[65]] The local administration and reduced plasma concentrations (<5%) result in a lower incidence of GI bleeds and infrequent serious adverse events compared to oral NSAIDs. If NSAID therapy is desired, begin with topical rather than oral agents in persons ≥75 years of age.​[^[14]] Monitor for serious adverse effects that may occur in the elderly, including GI upset.​[^[66]] Counsel patients on common side effects including dry skin and local application site reactions.

Other topical analgesics (see Table 3) can be used adjunctively with oral therapy for knee OA, but evidence supporting their use is limited. They may be offered to those refusing systemic therapy. Capsaicin has been shown to be superior to placebo for pain control in knee OA in 2 small studies, but patients were permitted to use oral analgesics.​[^[67]]​[^[68]] The burning sensation caused by capsicum derivatives is often not well tolerated. Capsaicin has not been studied for hand OA and should be avoided to prevent contamination of the eye.​[^[14]] Preliminary studies indicate that arnica gel may be comparable to topical ibuprofen for relief of OA pain, but further confirmatory studies are required.​[^[69]] If patients experience pain, swelling or burning from topical analgesics, advise them to stop using the product and seek immediate medical attention.​[^[70]]

|  | Evidence | Risk Management |
| Cardiovascular risks:Atrial fibrillation or flutterCongestive heart failureEdemaHypertensionMyocardial infarctionStroke | Edema and hypertension are the most commonly reported CV adverse effects.​[79]All NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of MI.​[80]​[81]​[82] Risk is highest with higher daily doses (i.e., celecoxib >200 mg, diclofenac >100 mg, ibuprofen >1200 mg and naproxen >750 mg). Absolute risk is higher in high CV risk patients.​[82] NSAID use is also associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation,​[83]​[84] heart failure,​[85]​[86]​[87] VTE​[88] and ischemic stroke.​[89]CV risk increases with COX-2 selectivity (among nonselective NSAIDs, diclofenac may carry higher risk), increased dose, recent or current use, or pre-existing CV disease.​[80]​[82]​[83]​[84]​[85]​[86]​[89]Compared with other NSAIDs, low-dose naproxen may carry less risk of cardiovascular disease.​[81] | All NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with high CV risk or with pre-existing severe CV disease​[a] (e.g., severe heart failure).COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac and high-dose ibuprofen should be avoided in patients with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease.Use low-dose naproxen or ibuprofen for short duration in patients with low to moderate risk factors for CV disease.Advise patients and caregivers to observe any CV issues and to record and report any hypertension, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, speech impairment, visual impairment or limb weakness.For patients with hypertension taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, consider the addition or dose increase of an antihypertensive agent of a different class.​[90] |
| Gastrointestinal toxicity:DyspepsiaGastroduodenal ulcersGI bleeding and perforation | Mild and transient nausea, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea and dyspepsia are the most commonly reported GI adverse effects.​[79] All patients may be at risk of GI adverse effects; however, risk is higher with:​[91]Age ≥65 Comorbid medical conditionsMultiple NSAID use (including low-dose ASA)High doses of NSAIDsHistory of upper GI bleedingPresence of H. pylori infectionConcomitant intake of antiplatelets, anticoagulants, SSRIs, SNRIs or corticosteroidsRisk of GI adverse effects may continue even after cessation of NSAID therapy.All NSAIDs confer an increased risk of GI damage;​[92] however, COX-2 inhibitors appear to be associated with a lower risk.​[93]​[94] Among the nonselective NSAIDs, evidence suggests that naproxen has a higher risk of GI adverse effects.​[78] | Topical NSAIDs (for knee and hand OA) and acetaminophen may be safer first-line options in patients at risk of GI adverse effects.Use low-dose NSAIDs for short durations.Consider testing for H. pylori infection before initiating NSAID therapy. Offer those who test positive an eradication therapy.​[95]In patients at moderate risk of GI adverse effects, use a PPI with a nonselective NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor.​[93]​[96]For patients at high risk of GI adverse effects, combination of selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI offers the best GI protection​[97]​[98] (see Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease).Misoprostol 200 mcg QID is effective in preventing NSAID-induced GI complications; however, it is not well tolerated.Advise patients to observe GI issues daily, and to record and report any dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, or signs of blood per rectum or with vomiting. |
| Nephrotoxicity:Acute kidney injuryChronic kidney injuryEdemaRenal insufficiency | Edema and hypertension are the most commonly reported renal adverse effects.​[79]All NSAIDs are associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury.​[99]​[100]Prolonged use of NSAIDs may increase risk of rapid CKD progression.​[101]Concomitant intake of ACE inhibitors, diuretics or ARBs increases risk of acute kidney injury.​[102] | Topical NSAIDs (for knee and hand OA) and acetaminophen may be safer first-line options, especially in the elderly.Avoid NSAIDs in patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr <30 mL/min).Monitor BP regularly (daily, weekly or monthly depending on the initial degree of patient risk). |

#### Antidepressants

Duloxetine, an SNRI, demonstrated significantly greater improvement in OA knee pain compared with placebo.​[^[103]] Adverse effects leading to discontinuation of the drug included nausea and asthenia.

Although SNRIs exhibit antiplatelet properties, the combination of duloxetine and NSAIDs does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding-related events compared with an NSAID used alone.​[^[104]] Of note, SNRIs have been added to the 2019 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list of drugs to avoid in patients with a history of falls or fractures.​[^[105]]

Consider duloxetine if a patient with OA presents with concomitant depression and/or neuropathic pain or widespread pain.​[^[41]]

#### Opioids

Tramadol may offer relief of moderate to severe pain in OA,​[^[106]] though a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that the magnitude of benefit is likely very small.​[^[107]] It has a less serious side effect potential than other opioids;​[^[107]] however, there are increasing safety concerns with the use of tramadol, including risk of dependence similar to that of non-tramadol opioids.​[^[108]]​[^[109]] Tramadol may be considered in patients who have not responded to other therapies.​[^[14]] It can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs. Both immediate-release and prolonged-release tramadol exhibit pharmacokinetic properties in the elderly similar to those in younger patients;​[^[110]] however, the elderly are recommended to be started on a lower initiating dose with dosage adjustments occurring for patients with severely impaired kidney function.

The use of non-tramadol opioids in OA has no long-term value.​[^[111]]​[^[112]] In addition, the side effect profile (constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, secondary dangers of falls and fractures) and potential for misuse preclude opioids as a choice in OA management,​[^[113]] except possibly as a last resort in patients who have exhausted all other treatment options or who have contraindications to NSAIDs.​[^[14]]​[^[114]] 

Any prescription of opioids should be according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines for opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain and should likely not precede treatment with anti-inflammatories or other atypical pain relievers.​[^[114]]

#### Glucosamine and Chondroitin

Endogenous glucosamine and chondroitin maintain the integrity of cartilage within a joint. The evidence on the efficacy of exogenous glucosamine and chondroitin is conflicting. Although some trials, at high risk of bias and of low-quality (e.g., lack of placebo comparator, small size), have shown moderate efficacy in reducing pain, stiffness and functional limitations, other studies as well as several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate efficacy.​[^[115]]​[^[116]] Accordingly, treatment guidelines do not recommend these supplements for the treatment of OA.​[^[14]] 

Despite the lack of evidence from trials, patients often report improvement after using products containing glucosamine and/or chondroitin. Those who are interested in taking these supplements can be advised that glucosamine sulfate may be superior to glucosamine hydrochloride, and that the best available evidence is for the use of chondroitin sulfate for hand OA.​[^[14]] Both glucosamine and chondroitin have good safety profiles.​[^[117]]​[^[118]]

#### Oral Corticosteroids

While preliminary studies have examined the use of oral corticosteroids for relief of acute OA pain,​[^[119]]​[^[120]] they are associated with significant side effects including loss of bone density and development of osteoporosis,​[^[121]] and may also increase the risk of joint osteonecrosis. Accordingly, oral corticosteroid use is not recommended for chronic OA pain.

#### Injectable Therapy

If nonpharmacologic, topical and oral options have been exhausted, injectable therapy may be considered.​[^[14]]​[^[41]] See Table 4 for injectable treatment options.

Although guidelines support the use of intra-articular corticosteroids,​[^[14]] evidence regarding their efficacy is conflicting and their place in OA therapy is thus controversial. Some trials, mostly of low methodological quality, have shown benefit in reducing pain and inflammation for up to 6 weeks post-injection.​[^[122]] The benefit may be greater in patients with more severe baseline pain;​[^[123]] in some cases, based on author experience, the effects may last for 3–6 months.​[^[124]] Other studies, of higher quality, did not find any benefits.​[^[122]]​[^[125]] Data on the safety of intra-articular corticosteroids are also conflicting. While a 2015 Cochrane review did not find evidence of harm in the short term (<6 months),​[^[122]] case-series and cohort studies indicate a possible worsening of pain and function, narrowing of joint space as well as joint deterioration.​[^[126]]​[^[127]] When considering intra-articular corticosteroids, the short-term benefits should be weighed against the possible long-term risks for every individual patient. Intra-articular corticosteroids may therefore be a suitable choice for patients who continue to have pain despite optimized nonpharmacological therapy (i.e., weight loss and exercise therapy) for whom NSAID therapy is contraindicated or provides inadequate relief, who are poor candidates for joint replacement surgery (e.g., frail elderly), or who are looking for short-term occasional pain relief. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids should not be administered more than 3–4 times per year in weight-bearing joints. An excessive number of injections increases the likelihood of producing a Charcot-type arthropathy, a condition marked by neuropathy and progressive bone resorption and deformity.​[^[128]]

Outcomes of individual studies of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee OA vary significantly due to differences in products and study designs.​[^[129]] Systematic reviews suggest a small effect on pain and function.​[^[129]]​[^[130]]​[^[131]] However, a network meta-analysis comparing different pharmacologic therapies for knee OA suggests that intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections are superior to oral NSAIDs and intra-articular corticosteroids in reducing pain and stiffness.​[^[72]] Additionally, the duration of benefit of hyaluronic acid injections may be longer than that of corticosteroid injections. It is reasonable to consider intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for knee OA in patients who have failed full-dose acetaminophen therapy and are ≥75 years of age or at high risk of NSAID adverse effects.​[^[14]]​[^[41]]

The combination of intra-articular corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid may benefit some patients. A double-blind study has shown that intra-articular knee injections of hyaluronic acid/​triamcinolone hexacetonide are superior to saline at 12 weeks and 26 weeks postinjection and better than hyaluronic acid alone at 1 and 3 weeks postinjection; however, similar benefit was noted at 6–26 weeks postinjection for both the combination and hyaluronic acid alone treatment groups.​[^[132]]

Some studies have shown that platelet-rich plasma **(PRP)** injections improve function for up to 12 months from baseline in patients with knee OA and tend to be more effective than hyaluronic acid injections.​[^[133]]​[^[134]] Multiple injections result in improvement after 6 months of therapy. Patients with mild to moderate OA with less degeneration tend to respond better to PRP injections;​[^[135]]​[^[136]] however, the quality of evidence remains low and PRP injections are not recommended.​[^[14]]​[^[41]]
