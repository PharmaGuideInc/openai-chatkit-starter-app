**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to assess and manage eye or eyelid problems. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

### Main Decision Point:
- **Eye or eyelid problem**

### Pathways and Decision Points:

1. **Pain, photophobia, disturbances of vision, blunt trauma, chemical exposure, foreign body, heat exposure, eye protrusion, or contact lens wearer?**
   - **Yes:** Requires immediate medical assessment. Pain may indicate serious conditions like corneal ulcer, iritis (uveitis), or dacryocystitis.
   - **No:** Proceed to next decision point.

2. **Red and/or irritated eye**
   - **Discharge?**
     - **Yes:** 
       - **Purulent?** 
         - **Probable bacterial conjunctivitis.** Recommend appropriate self-care for mild to moderate symptoms. Medical assessment required for children or adults with severe symptoms or no improvement within 48 hours.
       - **Watery?**
         - **Probable allergic conjunctivitis.** Recommend appropriate self-care. Medical assessment required if symptoms worsen or no improvement within 72 hours.
       - **Itching?**
         - **Probable viral conjunctivitis.** Requires medical assessment.
     - **No:** 
       - **Burning, fatigued, foreign-body sensation?**
         - **Probable dry eye.** Recommend appropriate self-care. Requires medical assessment if suspected to be secondary to medication or an undiagnosed condition (e.g., blepharitis) or if symptoms worsen or persist >5 days.

3. **Eyelid problem**
   - **Lid swollen with nodule?**
     - **Probable hordeolum or chalazion.** Recommend appropriate self-care. Requires medical assessment if no improvement after 48 hours.
   - **Itchy, red, scaly eyelid?**
     - **Lice infestation elsewhere on body?**
       - **Yes:** 
         - **Probable lice infestation of eyelid.** Recommend appropriate self-care.
       - **No:** 
         - **Probable blepharitis.** Investigate for possible associated conditions (e.g., acne, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis).

### Notes:
- The flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing common eye and eyelid conditions based on symptoms and signs.
- It emphasizes the importance of medical assessment for certain conditions and provides timelines for when to seek further medical evaluation.
