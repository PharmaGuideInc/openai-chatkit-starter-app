#### Assessment Algorithm

Patients may erroneously attribute any perianal symptom to hemorrhoids. In fact, these symptoms may be due to a number of conditions, ranging in severity from poor hygiene to colorectal cancer (see Table 1).​[^[1]] An assessment plan for patients reporting perianal symptoms is illustrated in Figure 1.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] All too often, patients seeking relief with nonprescription agents have delayed consulting a health-care practitioner until the symptoms have become unbearable and the condition has advanced to the point where medical referral is necessary.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to assess patients reporting perianal symptoms. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - **Patient reports perianal symptoms.**
   - **Decision Point:** Is the patient a child under 12 years of age?
     - **Yes:** Possible pinworms, sexual abuse, congenital abnormality. Requires further assessment.
     - **No:** Proceed to inquire about specific symptoms.

2. **Symptom Inquiry:**
   - Inquire about the presence and duration of perianal itch, bleeding, pain, burning, swelling, protrusion/prolapse.

3. **Rectal Bleeding Assessment:**
   - **Decision Point:** Is there rectal bleeding?
     - **Yes:** Further questions:
       - Is blood present in large amounts or dark in color?
       - Is bleeding recurrent?
       - Is the patient at high risk of colorectal cancer (refer to Table 1)?
         - **Yes:** Requires further assessment.
         - **No:** Continue assessment.
     - **No:** Proceed to next set of questions.

4. **Mass or Protrusion Inquiry:**
   - **Decision Point:** Has the patient noticed a mass or protrusion? Any seepage of stool or fecal incontinence? Associated fever? Any rectal or anal pain?
     - **Yes:** Requires further assessment.
     - **No:** Continue to next inquiry.

5. **Itching and Household Assessment:**
   - **Decision Point:** Is the predominant symptom itching and is there a child in the household?
     - **Yes:** Possible pinworms.
     - **No:** Proceed to hemorrhoid assessment.

6. **Hemorrhoid Symptom Consistency:**
   - **Decision Point:** Are symptoms consistent with hemorrhoids (itching, irritation, burning, swelling, small amounts of bright red blood on outer part of stools)?
     - **Yes:** See Hemorrhoids.
     - **No:** Requires further assessment.

This flowchart guides the clinician through a structured assessment of perianal symptoms, helping to identify potential causes and determine the need for further evaluation.
