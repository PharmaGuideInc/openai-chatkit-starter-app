#### Introduction

Onychomycosis (OM) is a fungal nail infection that may require prolonged treatment. In some patients, it can cause discomfort, pain and disfigurement, which results in functional and occupational limitations, impacting quality of life. It rarely remits spontaneously, reinfection is common and it may progress to affect other nails or skin areas.​[^[1]]

OM of the toenail affects about 6.4% of the Canadian population, with increasing prevalence in older individuals.​[^[2]] It is more common in persons with other nail problems (e.g., psoriasis or trauma), occupations requiring occlusive footwear, peripheral vascular insufficiency, hyperhidrosis, immunosuppressed states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection or immunosuppressive medications) and frequent public swimming pool users.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] In one-third of cases, there is an association with the presence of tinea pedis (athlete's foot) where the infection can serve as a reservoir of fungi and as a portal of entry for bacteria.​[^[8]]​[^[9]] Secondary bacterial infections and cellulitis may occur in patients with diabetes.​[^[10]]

Onychomycosis is caused primarily by dermatophytes (*Epidermophyton*, *Microsporum* and *Trichophyton* genera), occasionally by yeasts (*Candida albicans*) and rarely by nondermatophyte moulds.​[^[1]] When dermatophytes are the specific cause of the nail infection, this is called tinea unguium. The usual causative dermatophyte is *Trichophyton rubrum*. Occasionally, other dermatophytes such as *Trichophyton mentagrophytes* var. *interdigitale* and *Epidermophyton floccosum* are involved.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]



#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

OM is responsible for only ~50% of cases of abnormal-appearing nails.​[^[1]] The efficacy of treatments can be species dependent, and results from investigations may alter treatment selection.​[^[5]]​[^[17]] Therefore, it is essential to confirm a diagnosis by collecting specimens for examination prior to initiating treatment.​[^[18]] Diseases mimicking OM are listed in Table 1.

Fungal nail infections are most commonly diagnosed by direct microscopy (potassium hydroxide [KOH] examination of scrapings from the nail bed), biopsy (nail tissue/clippings with periodic acid–Schiff stain) or culture (on Sabouraud medium). The current standard for diagnosis is a combination of fungal culture and microscopy; fungal filaments or hyphae may be seen by examining scrapings from the infected nail plate.​[^[19]] If the culture is negative, it is recommended that a positive KOH stained nail be recultured as false negatives are a known issue with culturing.​[^[5]] Although overall accuracy of diagnosis is highest with biopsy,​[^[20]] it is the least cost-effective method but may be an alternative to culturing an infected nail.​[^[5]] 

| Differential Diagnosis to Consider | Clinical Features |
| --- | --- |
| Psoriasis | Symmetrical nail involvement. Nail pitting. Thick, silvery scales on elbows and knees. Terminal interphalangeal joint arthritis. |
| Eczema | Transverse ridges. Nail folds affected. History of eczema. |
| Onychogryphosis (senile) | Thickened, curved nail (claw-like) often seen in elderly persons with vascular insufficiency. |
| Trauma | Single nail affected, nail colour change is homogenous, nail shape is altered. |
| Lichen planus | Nails have prominent longitudinal ridges. Nail atrophy. Oral ulcers, itchy papules on wrists, shins and trunk. |
| Yellow-nail syndrome | Nails grow slowly, are yellow-green, thick and curved. Associated with defective lymphatic drainage in lungs causing pulmonary infections. |
| Drugs, e.g., tetracyclines, cancer chemotherapy | Onycholysis. |
| Malignant melanoma affecting the nail matrix or nail bed | Vertical pigmented bands form in the nail matrix (nail matrix melanoma) or red, brown or black nodule forms under the nail plate with ulceration and bleeding (subungual melanoma). |
| Squamous cell carcinoma | Papilloma or warty involvement of paronychia, erosions and scaling. |
| Bacterial paronychia | Acutely painful, red, swollen area of the nail fold or cuticle, which occurs suddenly in contrast to the slow onset seen with candidal paronychia. Bacterial paronychia is often also associated with pustules. |


#### Therapeutic Choices

Figure 1 illustrates an approach to the treatment of OM. Consider treatment in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, prior cellulitis, venous insufficiency, nail pain or in those who wish to improve the cosmetic appearance of the affected nails. Management options for OM include chemical/mechanical débridement, topical antifungal agents, systemic antifungal agents and/or a combination of these. Laser treatment and photodynamic therapy are other options but have limited evidence. Surgical removal of part or the full nail is generally discouraged as the new nail may become ingrown or reinfected.​[^[5]]​[^[23]] Inform patients that nail improvement will continue for months after the course of oral drug therapy is completed; fingernails take about 6 months to grow out while toenails take about 12 months. Also, recurrences are common.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Persons with OM should be treated for any associated tinea pedis. Prevention and nondrug strategies include:



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Topical and systemic agents used in the management of OM are described in Table 2. Treatment efficacy is demonstrated by either clinical cure or mycological cure rates. A mycological cure is indicated by results of potassium hydroxide/culture. Periodic acid–Schiff staining of a histological nail biopsy may be inaccurate because the viability of fungal organisms cannot be determined.​[^[25]] In terms of patient expectations, the clinical cure rate is the measure of interest as it corresponds with the appearance of the nail.​[^[26]]



#### Topical Therapy

Topical therapies are beneficial due to weak systemic absorption, no drug interactions, few adverse effects and no blood monitoring. They are less effective than systemic agents and evidence suggests that cure rates are poor when compared with placebo.​[^[21]]​[^[22]] However, topical monotherapy can be recommended for SWO​[^[23]] or early, mild and limited cases of DLSO or PSO (i.e., <20% nail involvement),​[^[25]] or when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Recurrence of infection is common upon discontinuation of treatment.​[^[19]] Cases with onycholysis or lunula involvement and patients who have multiple infected nails (i.e., >3 nails), who have been unresponsive to 6 months of topical agents or who have >60% of nail plate involvement should be treated with systemic therapy​[^[5]]​[^[23]]​[^[27]] (see Figure 1).

Ciclopirox **olamine 8%** lacquer monotherapy, a pyridone antifungal, when applied to nails daily for 48 weeks is costly, and when combined with débridement demonstrates only a 7% clinical cure rate and a 33% mycological cure rate.​[^[25]]​[^[28]] Daily application, weekly removal of lacquer residue with isopropyl alcohol, and débridement/trimming damaged or diseased parts of the affected nails for at least 48 weeks may be difficult to adhere to, particularly if the patient is elderly or has poor vision.​[^[21]] Combining ciclopirox 8% lacquer with oral terbinafine has not been shown to be more effective than terbinafine monotherapy.​[^[29]] Side effects include local skin irritation and temporary nail changes.

Efinaconazole** 10%** topical solution is a triazole antifungal indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate DLSO. It is applied to the affected nail(s) once daily for 48 weeks. No débridement is necessary due to enhanced penetration of the formulation. Removal of previously applied solution is not required as there is no buildup from daily application. Clinical cure rates of 17% and mycological cure rates of 54% have been demonstrated;​[^[25]] generally more patients with mild OM achieve a complete cure than patients with moderate OM.​[^[30]]

A nonprescription, topical solution containing propylene glycol-urea-lactic acid is available for once-daily application in the treatment of mild DLSO. The solution has an antifungal action through the disruption of the integrity of the cell wall of *T. rubrum*.​[^[31]] It markedly improves the visible appearance of the affected nail when used for 24 weeks.​[^[32]] Adverse effects include occasional pain and irritation at the site of application, onycholysis and a frequent occurrence (>10%) of nail whitening and opacity.

Limited evidence suggests that the available topical medications have comparatively poor cure rates.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[26]] Although evidence is lacking, filing the upper surface of the thickened nail (vigorous débridement) may increase the extent of penetration for a topical preparation and may increase the likelihood for successful topical therapy.​[^[19]]

#### Systemic Therapy

 Oral agents for OM treatment include the allylamine antifungal terbinafine and the azole antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole). Oral terbinafine is considered the drug of choice for OM caused by dermatophytes based on its higher efficacy, tolerability and lower risk of drug interactions.​[^[6]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]] Itraconazole may be preferred over terbinafine in treating OM caused by yeasts or nondermatophyte moulds.​[^[34]]​[^[37]] Efficacy of pulsed itraconazole therapy for 3–4 months is comparable to daily continuous itraconazole.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[38]] Terbinafine is about twice as effective as pulsed itraconazole in achieving complete cure (negative mycological analysis and visually normal nail) after 12 weeks of treatment.​[^[39]] There is no significant difference in recurrence rates between terbinafine and azole antifungals.​[^[36]] 

Fluconazole has relatively reduced efficacy and subsequently is not officially indicated for treatment of fungal nail infections. It may be considered an alternative if there is intolerance to the other agents.​[^[26]] Ketoconazole is not recommended to treat OM due to lack of supportive data and risk of hepatotoxicity.​[^[40]]

Oral fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine are associated with a low incidence of adverse events when used to treat OM.​[^[41]] Most common adverse effects include mild and transient headache, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain), viral infections or skin rashes.​[^[36]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]] Reports of photosensitivity, hepatotoxicity (0.11% with continuous itraconazole and 1.22% continuous fluconazole) and hematologic effects (neutropenia, leukopenia, monocytosis) are uncommon, but require ongoing monitoring.​[^[34]]​[^[41]] Checking pretreatment levels of serum aminotransferases is suggested for continuous use of these agents and therapy should be discontinued if liver enzymes are elevated. Serious drug interactions have occurred with itraconazole and fluconazole as a result of their CYP3A4 inhibition. Pulse therapy is associated with a lower risk of therapy discontinuation compared with continuous therapy.​[^[41]] Fluconazole may have a lower risk of treatment discontinuation compared with itraconazole or terbinafine.​[^[41]] The incidence of adverse events increases with higher doses of the antifungal agents.​[^[41]]

Treatment failure may be due to misdiagnosis, poor adherence or drug resistance. There is no convincing evidence that prophylactic topical antifungals reduce recurrence rates after successfully completing a treatment course with oral antifungals.​[^[5]]​[^[24]]​[^[33]] However, patients who later develop tinea pedis should be treated (usually with topical antifungals) in an effort to reduce the risk of recurrent OM. Patients who develop recurrent OM can be retreated with the same agent, but it is generally advised to switch to an alternative oral drug or to refer to a dermatologist. Longer treatment periods with an oral antifungal may delay a recurrence.​[^[12]]

#### Chemical or Surgical Avulsion

In unresponsive cases, chemical (urea 40% or urea 20% combined with 10% salicylic acid) or surgical (complete removal) nail avulsion or débridement (partial removal) combined with topical ketoconazole **2%** cream or ciclopirox **8%** lacquer applied under occlusion with polyethylene wrap may be directed by a podiatrist or dermatologist.​[^[43]]​[^[44]] Risks associated with nail avulsion include pain, possible wound infection and scarring.

#### Device-Based Therapy

Device-based therapeutic options (e.g., photodynamic therapy, iontophoresis and laser therapy) have been investigated for the treatment of OM as an alternative to current treatment options. Although there is some preliminary evidence of clinical improvement, further evaluation and larger well-designed studies are needed to determine their long-term efficacy and place in therapy.​[^[45]]​[^[46]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Choices during Pregnancy

Since fungal nail infections are generally nonurgent problems and require many months of systemic treatment, it is prudent to delay treatment until after pregnancy.​[^[47]] If drug treatment must be implemented, topical local therapy is preferred over oral systemic therapies. Topical antifungals all display limited, if any, systemic absorption so are theoretically considered safe in pregnancy; consider their use only when benefits outweigh potential risks.​[^[48]]

In animal studies of systemic antifungals, teratogenic effects have been observed with use in pregnancy. Fluconazole, used in high doses (>400 mg daily) for a prolonged period of time during the 1​[^st] trimester of pregnancy, may be associated with fetal malformations (craniofacial, skeletal and cardiac malformations).​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]] Large epidemiological studies of fluconazole for use in pregnancy have mixed results; more data are needed to confirm the risks of fluconazole when used for onychomycosis.​[^[48]]​[^[52]]​[^[53]] 

Although experience with itraconazole use in pregnancy is limited, prospective studies with first-trimester treatments for an average of 12 days and a maximum of 90 days, revealed no increased rate of major malformations.​[^[54]]​[^[55]] However, rates of spontaneous and induced abortion were higher in the exposed group.​[^[54]]​[^[55]] Larger studies are warranted to confirm these data.

Animal reproduction studies with terbinafine do not suggest any embryotoxicity,​[^[56]] but human pregnancy data are lacking.

#### Choices during Breastfeeding

Systemic treatment of the mother with itraconazole or terbinafine should be avoided during breastfeeding since these drugs accumulate in breast milk.

It is not known whether fluconazole is compatible with breastfeeding when used for many weeks in the treatment of OM. Short-term (2–3 wk) treatment with fluconazole is acceptable in nursing mothers for other conditions. The breastfed infant is expected to receive >15% of the maternal dose of fluconazole with a half-life in milk of 30 hours.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for the management of suspected Onychomycosis (OM). Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Start Point: Suspected OM**
   - Determine if there is an alternative cause for the nail changes (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, trauma, etc.).
     - **Yes:** Treat the underlying condition.
     - **No:** Proceed to laboratory confirmation of OM.

2. **Laboratory Confirmation of OM**
   - Assess if any of the following features apply:
     - Involvement of nail matrix, thick nails, severe onycholysis, diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised state, peripheral vascular disease, multiple nails involved, or patient requests treatment.
     - **No:** Treatment is unnecessary. Monitor the patient periodically for worsening signs or symptoms.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to treatment.

3. **Treatment Decision**
   - Determine if it is an early case of Distal Lateral Subungual Onychomycosis (DLSO) or Proximal Subungual Onychomycosis (PSO) with <20% involvement.
     - Criteria include: <one-third of the distal edge involved, minimal nail thickening, minimal onycholysis, lunula not involved, top nail surface only (SWO), limited involvement of 1 or 2 nails, no failure with previous topical therapies.
     - **Yes:** Use topical therapy ± mechanical debridement (e.g., efinaconazole, ciclopirox, or propylene glycol-urea-lactic acid combination product).
     - **No:** Conduct liver function test at baseline and mid-therapy.

4. **Further Treatment Based on Nail Involvement**
   - **>60% Nail Involvement:**
     - Use oral terbinafine.
     - If no resolution, switch to another oral agent or refer to a dermatologist.
   - **≤60% Nail Involvement:**
     - Use topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (if >3 nails).

5. **Post-Therapy Assessment**
   - After completion of therapy, check for:
     - New nail growth still diseased, multiple nails now involved, recurrence of paronychia, recurrence of tinea pedis, adjacent skin involved, evidence of secondary bacterial infection, or excessive irritation caused by topical agents.
     - **Yes:** Reassess and repeat laboratory work.
     - **Confirmation of OM?**
       - **No:** Refer to a dermatologist.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing suspected onychomycosis, considering alternative diagnoses, treatment options, and follow-up actions based on the extent of nail involvement and response to therapy.
