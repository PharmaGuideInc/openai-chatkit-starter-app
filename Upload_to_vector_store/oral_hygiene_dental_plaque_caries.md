#### Dental Plaque

#### Pathophysiology

Dental plaque is a gelatinous deposit that adheres to tooth surfaces, fillings or dental prostheses that is not removed by rinsing with water. It is composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in a matrix of bacterial or salivary glycoproteins and dextrans. Dental plaque is also referred to as “biofilm.”​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Plaque may accumulate on all surfaces of the teeth and may be recognizable within 24 hours of deposition. The area with the highest predilection for accumulation of plaque is the interproximal space (area between 2 adjacent teeth) of the molars and premolars, followed by the interproximal space of the anteriors and finally by the facial surfaces of the molars and premolars. Other areas of accumulation are the gingival margins, pits and fissures.​[^[2]] For an illustration of dental anatomy, see Teething, Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Dental plaque can be divided into 2 types based on its location relative to the gum: supragingival or subgingival. Supragingival plaque accumulates on the surface of the teeth. It is usually white to yellow in colour. When present in small amounts, it can be detected around the collar of the tooth with a probe or disclosing solution. When the volume is large, it is easily identifiable by the naked eye.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

Subgingival plaque accumulates on the tooth surface that is below the gum line or on the gingival margins. It is a key factor in the development of periodontal diseases. The structure of subgingival plaque differs from that of supragingival plaque: it appears to be less dense, the matrix is reduced and bacteria are freer.

#### Consequences of Plaque

The presence of plaque plays an important role in 2 pathologic processes in the mouth: the development of caries (cavities) and periodontal diseases.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Therefore, effective removal of supragingival dental plaque on a continuous daily schedule is essential to dental and periodontal health throughout life.​[^[7]] As subgingival plaque can be removed only with a professional cleaning, maintaining regular dental care is important.

#### Cariogenic Effect

Dietary sucrose increases plaque formation and the resulting plaque is more cariogenic. Studies have shown that ingestion of sucrose favours the colonization and aggregation of microorganisms on teeth and prosthetic devices. Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli play a primary role in cariogenic plaque. They act by metabolizing sucrose into organic acids that causes demineralization of the enamel and, with time, tooth decay.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]

#### Periopathogenic Effect

In most cases of periodontal disease, plaque on the tooth surface plays a role in initial and persistent disease presentation. The pathogenic role of dental plaque is described in Periodontal Conditions: Gingivitis and Periodontitis. 

#### Calculus

Dental calculus (tartar) is defined as the calcification of existing plaque deposits on the teeth or any other hard surface in the mouth (fillings; fixed or removable prostheses).​[^[3]]​[^[4]] It can be located supragingivally or subgingivally. When visible, it has a yellowish colour that may be darkened by dietary or exogenous pigmentation (e.g., coffee, tea, red wine, smoking). Its formation starts in areas close to the salivary gland openings, i.e., lingual (tongue) side of the lower incisors and the buccal (cheek) side of the upper molars. When located under the margin of the gingiva, the calculus often takes on a dark colour and is very adherent to the cementum of the tooth. The surface of the calculus is usually rough and favours plaque retention, subsequently leading to irritation and periodontal inflammation.

In most patients, calcification occurs within 48 hours in newly formed plaque. The amount of calculus being formed varies greatly from one individual to another and depends on many factors, such as the composition of saliva and the concentration of salivary enzymes. Therefore, control of calculus formation begins with controlling plaque formation. Calculus requires removal by a professional. In contrast, supragingival plaque can be controlled with good oral hygiene.

#### Plaque Control

#### Mechanical Methods

Mechanical removal of supragingival plaque may be achieved by brushing the teeth after every meal and at bedtime and by flossing once a day. Plaque removal is more effective when toothpaste is used, since toothpaste can increase the solubility of plaque and debris, making them both easier to remove (see Dentifrices).​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[8]] 

Table 1 presents a nonexhaustive list of devices and their role in removing plaque.

| Device | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Toothbrush | Remove plaque from buccal (cheek) and lingual (tongue) sides and occlusal (biting) surfaces of the teeth. |
| Dental floss | Remove plaque from interproximal surfaces (between the teeth). |
| Interdental (interproximal) brush (see Figure 1) | Remove plaque from concave root surfaces when attachment loss (detachment of the gingiva due to bone loss) is present. May be helpful in removing plaque from areas difficult to access with a toothbrush and regular floss.​[2]​[6]​[11] May also be useful for patients with orthodontic braces, dental implants, wide spaces between teeth, or fixed dental prostheses, such as bridge work. The rubber brushes may be more acceptable to patients than the metal versions.In the management of periodontitis, the adjunctive use of interdental brushes may contribute to prevention of recurrence.​[12] |
| Irrigating devices (dental water flosser, irrigating syringe) | Adjunct devices only; remove food debris and possibly some plaque from teeth.​[13]May be useful for patients with bridges or orthodontic appliances, after oral surgery, or for patients who do not have good manual dexterity. They can remove food debris and possibly some plaque.In the management of periodontitis, the adjunctive use of oral irrigators may contribute to prevention of recurrence.​[12] |
| Rubber tip gum stimulator (rod curved at one end with a sharp rubber tip) | Remove plaque by applying contouring pressure to hyperplastic gingival papillae (noninflammatory enlargement of the gingivae).​[11] |

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows three interdental brushes, each with a different colored handle: white, green, and pink. These brushes are designed for cleaning between teeth, where a regular toothbrush might not reach. Each brush has a thin, cylindrical handle with a small, spiral bristle head at the top. The bristle heads are identical in shape and size, suggesting they are used for similar purposes but may vary in bristle stiffness or handle grip for different user preferences. The colors likely indicate different sizes or types for specific dental needs.

#### Toothbrushing

The most recommended toothbrushing technique is the sulcular method, which focuses on removal of the plaque adjacent to and within the gingival crevice or sulcus (see Teething, Figure 1).​[^[5]]​[^[10]]​[^[14]] It is an effective method for the removal of plaque, particularly from the gingival area of the tooth and sulcus. The minimum brushing time required to effectively remove plaque is 2 minutes.​[^[15]] The tongue should be brushed as well. The technique is described in detail in the patient information section at the end of this chapter (see Healthy Teeth and Gums—What You Need to Know).

#### Toothbrushes

A suitable toothbrush is one with soft or extra-soft, flexible, rounded bristles that can penetrate into the gingival crevice to remove plaque without causing trauma to soft and hard tissues. It should also be small enough to reach all areas of the mouth.​[^[10]]​[^[14]]​[^[16]] Toothbrush replacement is recommended every 3 months or as soon as the bristles start to splay.​[^[10]] Studies have found no consistent superiority of one manual toothbrush over another for plaque removal or gingival inflammation reduction.​[^[2]]​[^[9]]

Mechanical/powered toothbrushes simulate manual toothbrushing in various ways, such as side-to-side (sonic) or circular motion (oscillating-rotating). A Cochrane systematic review found that powered toothbrushes are superior to manual toothbrushes at removing plaque and reducing gingival inflammation and are not more likely to cause injuries to gingivae.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] The use of a mechanical brush may be particularly beneficial when manual technique has failed, for patients with limited dexterity or for patients with orthodontic appliances.​[^[2]]​[^[9]]​[^[16]] Oscillating-rotating powered toothbrushes may be more effective than the sonic types.​[^[19]]

#### Flossing

Dental floss and tape, waxed or unwaxed, are equally effective for cleaning proximal surfaces. Individual factors such as contacts (where 2 adjacent teeth come together), restorations, tooth alignment and manual dexterity determine the type of floss chosen. The floss should slip easily between the teeth and pass the margin of the fillings without tearing and becoming lodged in the interproximal spaces. Unwaxed floss is suitable for most people; if it does not slide easily between the teeth, a waxed floss can be used; however, hypersensitivity to waxed floss and related exacerbation of periodontal conditions have been reported.​[^[20]] 

Floss-holding devices have proven effective for some patients who have difficulty guiding the floss with their fingers.​[^[14]]

Flossing should be performed once a day, preferably before bedtime,​[^[2]] since this is the longest period of time that plaque and food particles remain in the mouth undisturbed. Also, saliva production decreases overnight, which promotes the conversion of plaque to calculus.

Although the benefits of flossing have been questioned,​[^[21]] experts continue to recommend flossing as an essential part of oral hygiene based on clinical experience and evidence to support that flossing and/or using interdental brushes (along with toothbrushing) can reduce plaque and gingivitis.​[^[22]]​[^[23]]

#### Chemotherapeutic Methods

#### Dentifrices

Dentifrices (toothpastes, gels, pastes) aid in:​[^[24]]



Dentifrices contain various combinations of the ingredients found in Table 2.​[^[25]] Products that display the Canadian Dental Association (CDA) seal meet the needs of most patients. Particular needs should be discussed with the patient’s dentist or dental hygienist. 

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Dental Products: Dentifrices.

| Ingredients | Role | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calcium carbonate, dehydrated silica gels, hydrated aluminum oxides, magnesium carbonate, phosphate salts | Abrasive agents; remove debris and residual stains; whiten teeth | May cause burning sensation, drying of mucous membranes, taste alteration, gingival abrasion or enamel erosion. Tooth powders contain about 95% abrasives compared with 20–40% in toothpastes and gels. |
| Charcoal | Historical use | Often found in toothpastes advertised as fluoride-free or with quick whitening properties. Insufficient evidence to support role in oral hygiene; do not recommend.​[26] |
| Fluoride (including sodium and stannous salts), arginine, xylitol, hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate hydroxide) | Prevent caries formation | At a concentration of 0.22–0.24% (1000–1100 ppm), sodium fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization. If swallowed, excess amounts of fluoride can cause fluorosis (see Caries: Fluoride).Toothpaste with sodium fluoride 1.1% (5000 ppm) may be recommended as a nonrestorative treatment for caries.​[27]Arginine, in addition to fluoride, may aid in caries prevention, though evidence is not robust.​[28]​[29]Xylitol, in combination with fluoride in toothpaste, may decrease tooth decay by inhibiting the growth of cariogenic microbes.​[30]Hydroxyapatite may aid in the remineralization of enamel.​[31] |
| Humectants, e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol | Prevent toothpaste from drying out |  |
| Mineral colloids, natural gums, seaweed colloids, synthetic celluloses | Thickening agents; stabilize the formulation |  |
| Peroxides, sodium triphosphate | Whiteners | May work by breaking down pigments that accumulate on or in the tooth enamel. Some stains cannot be removed by toothpastes containing these whiteners, e.g., tetracycline staining, dental fluorosis. |
| Pyrophosphates, zinc citrate | Prevent supragingival calculus (tartar) formation; do not affect subgingival or existing calculus | Mechanism not established; may involve reduction of crystal growth on the tooth surface through chelation of cations. |
| Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium-N-lauryl sarcosinate | Detergents; foaming action may increase the solubility of plaque during brushing | A small percentage of patients may experience hypersensitivity to these components (e.g., development of aphthous ulcers). |
| Sodium phosphosilicate, potassium nitrate, stannous fluoride, strontium chloride, arginine, nano-hydroxyapatite | Desensitizing agents; improve dentin hypersensitivity | Have been shown to reduce dentin hypersensitivity in limited clinical trials; toothpastes containing arginine and nano-hydroxyapatite may be more effective than others.​[32] For more information, see Dental Conditions. |
| Stannous fluoride, triclosan, zinc citrate | Prevent gingival inflammation | Reduce plaque accumulation through antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity.​[33]​[34] |
| Xylitol, sweetening agents | Flavouring agents; improve palatability | Xylitol, in combination with fluoride in toothpaste, may also decrease tooth decay by inhibiting the growth of cariogenic microbes.​[30] |


#### Mouthwashes

In addition to plaque removal through brushing and flossing, chemical plaque control agents may be desirable in some circumstances, and the use of mouthwash has shown some benefits.​[^[35]] A number of commercially available mouthwashes may be good adjuncts to help control the development of supragingival plaque and reduce subsequent gingivitis (see Table 3). Oxygenating agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide) are not recommended because of potential adverse effects such as chemical burns of oral mucosa, decalcification of teeth and black hairy tongue.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Mouth Products: Mouthwashes.

| Active Ingredient(s) | Effect | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cetylpyridinium chloridee.g., Cepacol | Moderate plaque reduction | Less effective than chlorhexidine. May cause staining of teeth. |
| Chlorhexidinee.g., Peridex | High plaque reduction​[37] | Gold standard. Requires prescription.Limit use to once or twice daily; prolonged use may cause tooth staining, taste disturbances and discoloration of tongue.Other adverse effects include local irritation or allergic reactions.Alcohol-free formulations cause less drying of the mucosa and may be more acceptable to patients.​[38] |
| Sodium fluoridee.g., Opti-Rinse, Opti-Rinse NaF | Caries treatment and prevention | Sodium fluoride 0.2% rinse, used once weekly, may be recommended as a nonrestorative treatment for caries;​[27] it may also be considered for daily use, as preventative treatment for root caries.​[39]Lower concentration (0.05%) may be used once daily for caries prevention in high-risk patients;​[40] it may also be considered for prevention of root caries, in combination with sodium fluoride toothpaste.​[39] |
| Essential oils (thymol, menthol, eucalyptol and methyl salicylate [wintergreen oil])e.g., Listerine | High plaque reduction​[41] | Used twice daily; high alcohol content in some products; may cause burning sensation, bitter taste or mucosal drying; not recommended for children because of alcohol content. |


#### Care of Prostheses (Dentures)

#### Dentures

Any removable prosthesis should be cleaned after eating and before going to bed; if unable to brush dentures after the midday meal, the mouth and dentures should at least be thoroughly rinsed. Plaque and tartar can accumulate on artificial teeth as on natural ones. A denture brush or a soft toothbrush may be used to clean the prosthesis using a denture cleaner or mild soap. The gums and the remaining teeth should be cleaned carefully with a soft toothbrush. For patients who wear a partial denture, special attention should be paid to cleaning the teeth under the denture’s metal clasps, as plaque may become trapped, increasing the risk of tooth decay.​[^[42]]

A toothbrush may not be sufficient to remove debris; immersing the dentures in a commercial denture cleaning solution for 15 minutes once a day before brushing is helpful.​[^[43]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] Dentures with metal parts are not compatible with all cleaning solutions; some solutions (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) may cause corrosion of the metal. Household cleaning products should be avoided because they are too abrasive for use on acrylic resin surfaces. Dentures should be placed in a container and soaked (completely covered) in lukewarm water overnight to prevent dehydration and subsequent dimensional change. In spite of proper cleaning techniques, calculus may build up on some prostheses. Calculus should be removed in the dental office.

#### Dental Implants

Teeth supported by dental implants should be brushed and flossed carefully every day. All sides of the tooth supported by the implant should be brushed; floss should be used with caution where the implant meets the gum line.​[^[42]]​[^[46]] Interdental brushes with nylon-coated core wire may be helpful for maintaining dental implants.​[^[47]] Advise patients to avoid using brushes with hard and/or metal components, which can scratch the surface and allow for calculus deposits to form.

#### Oral Hygiene and Pregnancy

Regular dental care during pregnancy is recommended.​[^[48]]​[^[49]] Hormonal changes during pregnancy put patients at increased risk of gum disease, including gingivitis and periodontitis. Increased sugar intake due to pregnancy cravings may also increase the risk for caries. Encourage regular brushing and flossing to minimize risk. Recommend alcohol-free mouthwashes.

Erosion of the enamel may occur in patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum, or acid reflux. Recommend rinsing with baking soda solution (1 teaspoon baking soda dissolved in 1 cup of water) after each vomiting episode to neutralize acid; instruct patient not to brush the teeth for at least 30 minutes after rinsing to give enamel time to re-harden. 

There is concern that systemic fluoride intake during pregnancy may be associated with impaired neurocognitive development in exposed children; however, these findings are based on very limited evidence.​[^[50]] Some experts may suggest that pregnant patients reduce systemic intake of fluoride (e.g., fluoridated water) during pregnancy. For more information on fluoride supplementation, see Fluoride.

For more information on managing conditions common in pregnancy, see Pregnancy and Breastfeeding: Self-care Therapy for Common Conditions and Prenatal and Postpartum Care.

#### Caries

Dental caries are the result of localized and progressive dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissues of the teeth due to an infectious process.​[^[5]]​[^[51]]

Bacteria from dental plaque are capable of producing organic acids from the metabolism of dietary carbohydrates as well as from proteolytic enzymes in the saliva. In response to the decrease in pH at the tooth surface, calcium and phosphate ions diffuse out of the enamel, and demineralization takes place. With time, disintegration of the mineral component of enamel and dentin occurs, with subsequent formation of a cavity on either the enamel surface or root surface.

The sites on the tooth where plaque can accumulate are more prone to decay, e.g., pits and fissures (occlusal surface for the posteriors and palatal surface for the anteriors), smooth enamel surfaces that shelter cariogenic biofilm (proximal and cervical areas) and the root surface. 

Susceptibility is also dependent upon host factors such as the volume and composition of the saliva.​[^[5]]​[^[51]] Patients with xerostomia (dry mouth) have a higher risk and incidence of caries due to decreased salivary flow (see Dry Mouth).​[^[52]] Saliva plays various protective roles against tooth decay.​[^[5]]​[^[52]]

#### Types of Caries

#### Enamel Caries

Initially, the lesion appears as a white spot due to demineralization of the enamel. With repeated exposure to acid, the surface changes from smooth to rough and may become stained. If left untreated, pitting and then cavitation occurs;​[^[5]] see Figure 2.

#### Arrested Caries

Under favourable conditions, the lesional process in the enamel may stop, become inactive and may even regress. Most of the time, arrested enamel caries have an opaque or dark appearance.​[^[5]]

#### Dentin Caries

In the dentin, demineralization is followed by bacterial invasion. Dentin has the ability to produce secondary dentin in an attempt to protect the pulp, but its proximity to the pulp also represents a risk of bacterial invasion into the pulp itself.​[^[5]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a series of four illustrations showing the progression of tooth decay. Each illustration represents a different stage of decay, labeled accordingly:

1. **White Spot**:
   - The first illustration shows a tooth with a white spot on the enamel, indicating the initial stage of decay where demineralization occurs.

2. **Enamel Decay**:
   - The second illustration depicts decay that has progressed into the enamel. A visible cavity is present on the surface of the tooth.

3. **Dentin Decay**:
   - The third illustration shows decay that has reached the dentin layer beneath the enamel. The cavity is larger and more pronounced.

4. **Involvement of The Pulp**:
   - The fourth illustration demonstrates advanced decay where the pulp of the tooth is affected. The cavity is extensive, reaching deep into the tooth structure.

Each stage visually represents the increasing severity of tooth decay, highlighting the progression from surface-level damage to deeper structural involvement.

#### Early Childhood Caries

Any preschool-age child presenting with 1 or more decayed, missing (due to caries) or filled tooth surface in a primary tooth is considered to have early childhood caries (ECC), a complex and chronic disease. To reduce the risk of ECC, the Canadian Dental Association recommends dental assessments for infants within 6 months of the first tooth erupting and at least by the age of 1 year.​[^[53]] Children in Indigenous communities face significant oral health disparities and are at an increased risk of ECC; the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends early preventive measures (e.g., fluoride varnish after first tooth eruption and every 3–6 months) to reduce their risk.​[^[54]] Health-care practitioners who identify children with ECC should refer them to a dental professional for further assessment and care.

#### Caries Prevention

Prevention of caries can be achieved by:​[^[5]]​[^[51]]​[^[52]]​[^[53]]​[^[55]]



#### Caries Treatment

Depending on caries risk and incidence, the following therapeutic modalities may be recommended:​[^[5]]​[^[55]]​[^[59]]​[^[60]]



#### Fluoride

The use of fluoride to prevent and control dental caries is well documented, safe and effective.​[^[55]]

#### Topical Fluoride

Locally administered fluoride benefits the enamel by reducing demineralization and promoting remineralization of early caries. The resulting remineralized enamel has improved resistance to acid attack. In the presence of fluoride, acid production by bacteria in plaque is decreased, as is the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides.​[^[5]]​[^[36]]

For caries prevention in children, the monitored use of fluoridated dentifrice is recommended until the child is able to expectorate the dentifrice, which is around the age of 6 years.​[^[42]]​[^[62]] For a child between 3 and 6 years of age, a pea-sized amount on the toothbrush is recommended; for a child younger than 3, only a rice grain–sized amount of toothpaste should be used and the teeth should be brushed by an adult. To minimize the risk of fluorosis, it is important for the caregiver to ensure the child does not swallow the toothpaste. A nonfluoridated dentifrice may be considered until the age of 3.​[^[62]] In some cases, based on the individual child’s risk of caries, professionally applied fluoride may be indicated. For children considered at high risk of caries, home protocols may be recommended by the dentist on an individual basis.​[^[63]]

For caries prevention in adults, fluoridated dentifrices are available in various strengths (0.11–1.1%). The most commonly recommended and available fluoridated dentifrices are 0.243% (1100 ppm). Dentifrices with a higher concentration of fluoride may prevent further tooth decay in higher-risk populations, including the elderly;​[^[64]] these products may not be readily available and may require a special order from the dentist or pharmacist.

As a preventive measure, fluoride mouthwashes could be recommended to patients at high risk of developing caries.​[^[40]] Mouthwashes are available in various strengths (0.05–0.2%); see Table 3 for more information. Health Canada does not recommend this measure for patients under 6 years of age, due to risk of ingestion.​[^[65]]

Other forms of fluoride (gels, foams and varnishes) may be applied professionally in patients at high risk of developing caries.​[^[63]]​[^[66]]​[^[67]] 

#### Systemic Fluoride

Systemic fluoride improves the crystallinity and decreases the acid solubility of enamel formed in the pre-eruptive phase of tooth development. In addition, it may affect tooth anatomy and reduce the risk of caries associated with pits and fissures in the teeth. Systemic fluoride does not confer any benefit on erupted teeth. 

The addition of fluoride to drinking water is recognized as a cost-effective public health measure.​[^[65]] In areas where the water is not fluoridated, supplemental oral fluoride may be considered.​[^[42]]​[^[63]]​[^[68]] For most Canadians, supplemental oral fluoride is not recommended. It may be indicated for high-risk individuals in nonfluoridated communities when fluoride is not obtained in other forms (toothpaste) and after a careful analysis of the total amount from all other sources has been completed.

Excessive amounts of systemic fluoride may result in dental fluorosis of developing teeth in children, which typically manifests as white specks on the child’s temporary or permanent teeth; it can appear as dark spots in severe presentations. It is a permanent cosmetic alteration of the enamel; there is no evidence that it affects the health of the child. Fluorosis does not affect teeth that have already erupted. 

Risk of fluorosis is greatest in children <2 years of age​[^[52]] and is decreased after the eruption of the first permanent tooth (6–8 y of age).​[^[69]] To minimize the risk, oral fluoride supplements are typically not recommended before the eruption of the first permanent tooth. In individual cases where the benefits outweigh the risk of dental fluorosis (e.g., orthodontic or prosthodontic appliances, reduced salivary function, high caries activity), practitioners may recommend supplements to young children at appropriate doses.​[^[62]] All other sources of fluoride should be carefully assessed and the total daily dose of fluoride should not exceed 0.05–0.07 mg/kg of body weight.​[^[63]] Use the recommended amounts of toothpaste based on the child’s age, and ensure that it is not being swallowed during brushing (see Topical Fluoride).

After the eruption of the first permanent tooth, the risk of dental fluorosis is decreased and fluoride supplements in the form of lozenges or chewable tablets could be considered, as the fluoride would be delivered locally (intraorally). Lozenges and chewable tablets should be used preferentially over drops for their local action. A lozenge or chewable tablet containing 1 mg of fluoride delivers the same amount of fluoride as 1 g (average amount used) of a 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste.

#### Administration of Systemic Fluoride

Fluoride tablets should be taken with a glass of water or juice. Calcium from milk or other dairy products may bind with fluoride, causing both to be poorly absorbed.​[^[62]] If possible, ingestion of calcium-containing products within 1 hour of fluoride administration should be avoided.

Gastric distress, headache and weakness have been reported in cases of excessive ingestion of fluoride. Allergic reactions such as rash and other idiosyncratic reactions have been rarely reported.​[^[62]] Chronic intake of very large amounts of fluoride can cause skeletal fluorosis, which may present as joint pain.​[^[70]] When fluoride is taken as directed, no adverse effects have been reported.​[^[62]]

To prevent overdoses, experts recommend no more than 120 mg of fluoride should be dispensed per household at one time.​[^[62]]
