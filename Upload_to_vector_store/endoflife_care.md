#### Introduction

Patients at the end of life are confronted with many troubling symptoms (see Table 1) requiring a team approach to care. This chapter provides management strategies for common symptoms in the last 48 hours of life; a discussion of the palliative care journey (>48 h of life) is outside the scope of this chapter. The therapies presented are recommended by experienced palliative care teams and can be used in the home setting. 

| In the last 1–2 weeks | In the last 48 hours | Symptom | Incidence (%) | Symptom | Incidence (%) | Symptom | Incidence (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fatigue | 88 | Noisy and moist breathing | 56 | Dyspnea | 22 |  |  |
| Weight loss | 86 | Urinary dysfunction | 53 | Nausea and vomiting | 14 |  |  |
| Weakness | 74 | Pain | 51 | Sweating | 14 |  |  |
| Appetite loss | 56 | Restlessness and agitation | 42 | Jerking, twitching | 12 |  |  |


#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

Certain principles are essential for optimal symptom management in the end-of-life setting: 



#### Dyspnea

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 lists drugs used in the treatment of dyspnea.

#### Opioids

Oral and parenteral opioids are effective and recommended in the management of breathlessness in end-of-life care.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] The acute situation may require frequent parenteral dosing (e.g., morphine 5–10 mg SC or IV Q30 min until settled); otherwise, the usual dosing regimen involves Q4H dosing with Q1H breakthrough doses. Nebulized opioids should *not* be used, as there is no evidence for this treatment modality.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]]

Intermittent dyspnea can be treated with intermittent opioids. If titrated to control dyspnea, opioids will not hasten death.​[^[8]]

Sublingual fentanyl has been shown to be effective for breathlessness.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] Onset is quick but duration of effect is only about 40–60 minutes.​[^[11]] Sublingual fentanyl tablets are available in Canada, but the lowest available dose is higher than the usual starting dose of fentanyl for this indication. Some palliative care protocols use the parenteral formulation sublingually; this option can be beneficial in the home setting when parenteral access may be limited.​[^[12]] Patients need access to a home-care nurse or a pharmacy willing to prepare doses in advance.

#### Nonopioids

**Benzodiazepines** such as clonazepam, lorazepam and midazolam have been widely used to manage dyspnea in the palliative care setting, possibly through relief of anxiety, despite a lack of strong evidence of efficacy.​[^[13]] Though their use is not validated, benzodiazepines may provide improved control of dyspnea compared with opioids in terms of duration of action, potency and reduced adverse effects, especially in the absence of pain or when there is a clear component of anxiety. 

Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) have a specific role in the management of dyspnea resulting from obstructive lesions, lymphangitic carcinomatosis or COPD exacerbations. CNS adverse effects may limit their utility.

#### Pain



#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 lists drugs used in the treatment of pain.

A step-wise approach to pain management is mandated in all cases (see also Acute Pain and Neuropathic Pain). For mild pain, **nonopioid analgesics** can be tried (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs; see Acute Pain for dosing information) with or without an opioid; however, *mild* pain is rare in this setting. In the acute palliative care setting, opioids (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) are usually the mainstay of therapy (see Opioids (CPhA Monograph)).



| Category | Effects | Comments | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General | Nausea | Very common; tolerance develops in 2–3 days | **metoclopramide** |
|  | Constipation | Very common; ongoing treatment is mandatory | **laxatives** |
|  | Somnolence | Very common; tolerance develops in 2–3 days | Reassure patient |
|  | Pruritus | Less common | Antihistamines; may require a change of opioid |
|  | Dry mouth | Less common | Chew gum; suck on hard candy or ice chips; use saliva substitutes |
| Opioid-induced neurotoxicity | Myoclonus | More common in long-term use | May require change of opioid |
|  | Delirium | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |
|  | Hallucinations | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |
|  | Hyperalgesia | See myoclonus | See myoclonus |


Adjuvant drugs may be useful in specific pain syndromes, e.g., NSAIDs or corticosteroids for bone pain; tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. However, the introduction of adjuvant analgesics is rarely indicated in the last 48 hours of life. Continuation of previous therapy should be carefully reviewed.

#### Nausea and Vomiting

Though less common in occurrence at the end of life, if present, nausea and vomiting can be a source of great distress. The investigation and treatment of reversible causes (e.g., hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, bowel obstruction) may not be reasonable at the very end of life.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices



See also Nausea and Vomiting.

#### Terminal Delirium and Agitation

Patients often exhibit increasing confusion, drowsiness and/or restlessness and moaning during progressive multi-organ failure.



#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

 Table 3 lists drugs used in the treatment of delirium and agitation.



#### Respiratory Secretions

Pooling of pharyngeal and pulmonary secretions is common with decreased levels of consciousness causing inability to expectorate. This symptom (previously termed “death rattle”) is usually of no consequence to the patient but can be quite distressing to the caregivers.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacological Choices

Table 3 lists drugs used in the treatment of respiratory secretions.
