#### Introduction

Without proper tools (such as a visual acuity chart, slit lamp or indirect ophthalmoscope), it is difficult for a primary care practitioner to diagnose and manage the complications of a postoperative cataract patient. The goal of this chapter is to review signs and symptoms that would require an urgent referral to an ophthalmologist. These include postoperative infection, glaucoma, inflammation or any suspected issues with healing. Figure 1 can be utilized to help assess if urgent referral is required.

The medications listed within the chapter are those that are typically given *prophylactically* to prevent infection (see Table 2), a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) (see Table 3) and cystoid macular edema (CME) (see Table 4), as well as to improve healing (see Table 5).

#### Goals of Therapy

The goals of *perioperative prophylactic pharmacologic treatment* are: 



The goals of *postoperative assessment* are:



#### Investigations

Figure 1 illustrates an assessment process for the postoperative cataract patient. Table 1 summarizes the red flags requiring urgent referral.



| On history: | On examination: |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trauma to eye postsurgery | Swollen or red eyelids or conjunctiva | Hazy cornea |
| Blurry or worsening vision | Hypopyon (white layer) in anterior chamber | Poor or absent red reflex with direct ophthalmoscopy |
| Persistent or progressively painful eye (may also have headache, nausea, vomiting or feel unwell) or light sensitivity | Flat (poorly formed) anterior chamber | Seidel-positive wounds (leakage of fluid from anterior chamber when fluorescein is instilled in eye) or iris peaking toward wound or prolapsing from wound |
| Persistent or progressive shadows, flashes, or floaters | Elevated intraocular pressure |  |


#### Therapeutic Choices

Although cataract surgery is a very commonly performed procedure, practice patterns related to patientsâ€™ preoperative and postoperative care vary depending upon the surgeonsâ€™ preferences and habits.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Prophylactic ophthalmic medications may include:



Other systemic medications should be continued, including antiplatelets and anticoagulants, unless otherwise specified by the surgeon.

#### Therapeutic Tips

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart titled "Cataract Surgery Postoperative Assessment." It is designed to guide the assessment process following cataract surgery, focusing on two main areas: History and Physical Examination.

### History
1. **Vision is clear, eye is comfortable and no shadows, floaters or flashes**
   - Outcome: **Normal**

2. **Vision is not clear or Eye is uncomfortable or Patient seeing shadows, floaters or flashes**
   - Outcome: **Call ophthalmologist**

### Physical Examination
1. **Lids and/or conjunctiva red/swollen or Ophthalmoscope does not reveal clear view of optic disc and good red reflex**
   - Outcome: **Call ophthalmologist**

2. **Lids and/or conjunctiva white with minimal swelling/redness and ophthalmoscope shows clear view of optic disc and good red reflex**
   - Outcome: **Normal**

The flowchart provides a structured approach to determine whether the postoperative condition is normal or if there is a need to contact an ophthalmologist based on specific criteria observed in the patient's history and physical examination.
