CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

Gout is a disease in which monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals deposit in joints; soft tissues such as cartilage, tendon and bursa; or in renal tissues such as glomeruli, the interstitium and tubules. This can result in gouty arthritis, tophi, nephropathy or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Gouty arthritis is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis in men >40 years of age. The mean age of onset is the fourth decade in males and the sixth decade in females. It is unusual for an attack to occur before age 30 in males and age 50 in females unless the patient has an inherited enzyme abnormality. The incidence and prevalence of gout is increasing, reflecting the fact that at-risk populations are increasing.

An association between gout and metabolic syndrome has been established,​[^[1]] as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged men diagnosed with gout.​[^[2]] Studies have also shown that greater reduction of serum uric acid levels is associated with greater preservation of renal function.​[^[3]]

This chapter discusses the 4 stages of gouty arthritis: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, gouty flare, intercritical gout (prophylaxis of gouty flare and management of hyperuricemia) and chronic gouty arthritis. For the treatment of acute gouty arthritis see Figure 1 and for management during intercritical gout see Figure 2.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia

#### Assessment and Risk Factors

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia refers to elevated serum urate levels (>360 µmol/L in females and >420 µmol/L in men) without any clinical manifestations.​[^[6]] During puberty, male serum urate levels increase by 60–120 µmol/L to levels of 240–360 µmol/L. Women develop increased urate levels after menopause, when values approach those of men. In 70% of patients with hyperuricemia, an underlying cause is discovered by history and physical examination.​[^[6]] Drugs and systemic conditions that may be associated with hyperuricemia are shown in Table 1. Hyperuricemia is not an indication for urate-lowering therapy. Most patients with hyperuricemia remain asymptomatic throughout life. Causes of uric acid overproduction should be assessed in certain patients, such as those with onset before 25 years of age and those with history of urolithiasis.​[^[4]]

This phase ends with the first attack of gouty arthritis or urolithiasis, typically after 20 years of sustained hyperuricemia. The annual incidence of acute arthritis is 0.1–0.5% among patients with a urate level between 420 and 540 µmol/L, and 5% when it is >540 µmol/L.​[^[7]] Similarly, the risk of nephrolithiasis increases with an increasing serum urate level and an elevated measurement for 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion.

#### Gouty Flare

#### Investigations

History, physical and laboratory examinations:



In 2015, the ACR/EULAR (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology, formerly the European League Against Rheumatism) published its gout classification criteria.​[^[10]] It was developed to incorporate a new set of criteria that would allow classification of gout at any stage and determine whether or not monosodium urate crystals have been aspirated from synovial fluid (see Figure 3). It incorporates clinical criteria such as pattern/location of joint/bursa involvement, character of episode, time-course of episode and presence of tophus. It also incorporates laboratory criteria (level of urate) and imaging criteria (evidence of urate deposition or evidence of joint damage) through the use of ultrasound, dual-energy CT or x-rays. Patients need a score of ≥8 out of 23 to fulfill the classification criteria for gout. The sensitivity and specificity are 92% and 89%, respectively. If patients have evidence of monosodium urate crystals in fluid from a symptomatic joint or bursa, or tophus aspirate, they fulfill the classification criteria for gout. 

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Topical ice application is an appropriate adjunctive therapy to 1 or more pharmacologic treatments for acute gouty arthritis.​[^[11]]​[^[12]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Treatment of a gout flare should be initiated as quickly as possible after onset (see Figure 1).

NSAIDs, colchicine or **oral corticosteroids** are appropriate first-line options in therapy of acute gout.​[^[11]] Treatment should be initiated within the first 24 hours of acute gout attack onset.

Traditionally, colchicine 0.6 mg was given each hour until there was control of inflammation, a total dose of 6 mg was reached or GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps or diarrhea) limited further use.​[^[13]] The current recommendation is to give 1.2 mg initially, then another 0.6 mg 1 hour later (for a total of 1.8 mg colchicine); a prophylactic dose of 0.6 mg once to twice daily can be started 12 hours after the last treatment dose. This regimen is equally effective, with a much lower incidence of side effects.​[^[12]]​[^[14]] Colchicine is not recommended if the patient presents more than 36 hours after onset of symptoms.​[^[11]] Colchicine may have extra-articular benefits; a cohort study demonstrated that amongst patients with gout, new users of colchicine had a 49% decreased risk of cardiovascular events and a 73% reduction in all-cause mortality.​[^[15]]

NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and swelling in gout flare.​[^[16]] They are initiated at high doses then quickly reduced once improvement occurs (see Table 2). Adverse effects are more frequent in elderly patients with renal dysfunction. High-dose celecoxib may be as effective as nonselective NSAIDs in reducing pain, and is associated with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability.​[^[17]] In patients at risk for ulcer complications (e.g., age >65, previous GI bleed, comorbid medical conditions, low-dose aspirin or anti-coagulant use), consider using celecoxib with a proton pump inhibitor first followed by celecoxib alone and lastly a nonselective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal protection.​[^[18]]

Corticosteroids are a third option for gout flare therapy.​[^[11]]​[^[19]] An oral corticosteroid option includes a short-term course of prednisone, e.g., 0.5 mg/kg daily. Systemic corticosteroids were shown to be as effective as NSAIDs in reducing pain (at rest or with activity), as well as in time-to-resolution of symptoms.​[^[20]] Intra-articular, IM or IV corticosteroids are particularly useful in patients unable to tolerate oral therapy. With short-term systemic therapy, tapering regimens are not usually necessary. The intra-articular injection of corticosteroids into a single joint at the time of diagnostic arthrocentesis is ideal therapy and usually results in rapid control of inflammation and symptoms. The intra-articular route may not be suitable for polyarticular joint involvement.

Combination therapy is an appropriate option particularly when symptoms are severe, the attack is polyarticular or large joints are involved.​[^[11]] Combination therapy may also be indicated in patients not responding to monotherapy. Combinations may include colchicine plus an NSAID; colchicine plus oral corticosteroids; or intra-articular corticosteroids plus an NSAID, oral corticosteroid or colchicine.

Recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) receptor inhibitors such as anakinra​[^[21]] and canakinumab​[^[22]]​[^[23]] are recommended for gout flare in patients who have failed or cannot take colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Based on a review of 3 studies comparing canakinumab 150 mg single SC injection and triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg single IM injection, there is moderate-quality evidence of reduction of pain and swelling, as well as patient-reported good or excellent treatment response.​[^[23]] Adverse effects were more common in the canakinumab group and included back pain, arthralgias, headache and hypotension.​[^[23]]​[^[24]] IL-1 inhibitors should be avoided in patients with concurrent infection. IL-1 inhibitors are not approved for the treatment of acute attacks of gout in Canada.

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Intercritical Gout and Prophylaxis

#### Introduction

Intercritical gout is asymptomatic with the focus on prophylaxis of gouty flare and management of hyperuricemia. Most patients have a second attack within 6–24 months of the first. Subsequent attacks are less severe but more frequent, severe and enduring. These attacks are often polyarticular with upper extremity involvement and constitutional symptoms. Erosive radiographic changes and tophi may develop during intercritical gout, especially with frequent attacks of gouty arthritis. About 12–58% of patients have urate crystals in synovial fluid during this phase.​[^[6]] See Figure 2 for suggested management of hyperuricemia during intercritical gout.

#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

There is a clear relationship between obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m​[^2]) and gout. Obese patients should lose weight in order to achieve ideal body mass index. Encourage patients to exercise regularly, quit smoking, remain well hydrated and follow a healthy diet, as indicated below.​[^[4]] Such lifestyle changes can reduce serum urate by 10–18%.​[^[24]] The ACR recommends the following dietary guidelines:​[^[12]] 



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) includes **xanthine oxidase inhibitors** and **uricosurics** (see Table 2). The 2020 ACR guidelines recommend initiating ULT for gout patients with any of the following:​[^[12]]



ULT is not recommended in patients who are experiencing their first gout flare and in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.​[^[12]] 

A treat-to-target approach has been recommended by the ACR​[^[4]]​[^[12]] and EULAR.​[^[5]]​[^[25]] The minimum serum urate target is <360 µmol/L, the saturation point of monosodium urate in the extracellular fluid.​[^[6]] A lower serum urate target (<300 µmol/L) is recommended in patients with more severe gout (e.g., patients with tophaceous gout) to facilitate the improvement of signs and symptoms through the dissolution of urate crystals. Once the urate crystals have dissolved, a maintenance serum target should be <360 µmol/L to avoid the development of new tophi. 

During intercritical gout, nonessential prescription medications that induce hyperuricemia (see Table 1) should be discontinued. Patients on low-dose ASA should continue therapy if used for prevention of cardiovascular disease.​[^[4]] However, initiation or dose-adjustment of urate-lowering therapy may be important to prevent recurrent gout flares with low-dose ASA.​[^[26]] The ACR recommends switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. ​[^[12]]

#### Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the mainstay of the treat-to-target approach and can be initiated during a gout flare as long as effective anti-inflammatory treatment has been started. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors include allopurinol and febuxostat, and work by inhibiting the production of uric acid. Uricosurics may be used as an add-on if necessary.​[^[27]] A patient should be started on 1 of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors and the dose should be titrated upward every 2–5 weeks to an appropriate maximum dose in order to achieve the target serum urate level. Once the serum urate target is reached, urate levels should be checked every 6 months.

Initially there was no preference for one xanthine oxidase inhibitor over another. However, in 2019 the FDA added increased risk of death to the black box warning of febuxostat based on a large postmarketing trial that revealed a greater frequency of adverse cardiovascular events with febuxostat than allopurinol in a high-cardiovascular-risk population.​[^[28]] The FDA recommended that febuxostat should be used only in patients who have failed or are not able to tolerate allopurinol. Febuxostat showed a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (4.3% vs. 3.2%) and all-cause mortality (7.8% vs. 6.4%) compared with allopurinol.​[^[29]] However, febuxostat was not associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint, a combination of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent revascularization (10.8% vs. 10.4%). The trial was not placebo-controlled; thus, it remains unclear whether allopurinol may have had cardiovascular protective effects leading to lower mortality or whether febuxostat had actually increased mortality.

Another large post-marketing open-label safety trial, the Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial (FAST), did not find increased cardiovascular events with febuxostat.​[^[30]] This trial involved 6128 patients with gout in the European Union, who were ≥60 years of age and being treated with allopurinol. Patients were randomly assigned to switch to febuxostat or continue allopurinol, with dose adjustment to maintain target serum urate levels. One-third of patients had a history of a previous cardiovascular event; the others had at least one cardiovascular risk factor but no prior event. After a median follow-up of approximately 4 years, there were no significant differences between the groups in overall mortality; cardiovascular mortality; or in a composite outcome of cardiovascular events, which included hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction or biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death. 

The ACR 2020 guidelines recommend allopurinol as the first-line agent for all patients due to the potential cardiovascular risk, including in those patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage ≥3).​[^[12]] A starting dose of allopurinol ≤100 mg daily is recommended for patients with normal kidney function; if patients have stage 4 or worse chronic kidney disease (GFR ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m​[^2]), the starting dose should be 50 mg daily. Starting with a lower initiating dose of allopurinol reduces gout flares and may also help to reduce severe hypersensitivity reactions. More than half of patients may require a dose of allopurinol >300 mg daily. Traditionally, allopurinol has been dosed for maintenance according to a practical but non-evidence-based algorithm according to kidney function to avoid a severe hypersensitivity syndrome.​[^[4]] The risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is about 1 in 1000 patients.​[^[4]] This can present with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or systemic diseases including rash, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, vasculitis, cytopenia, eosinophilia, and major end-organ disease. The reported mortality rate is 20–25%. Risk factors for AHS include renal impairment, use of thiazide diuretics and high allopurinol starting dose.​[^[4]] The HLA-B*5801 genotype, which is more common in certain races, is also associated with AHS. The ACR recommends that cost-effective testing for the HLA-B*5801 allele prior to starting allopurinol is only required when the allele is likely present. This applies to patients of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai and African American descent.​[^[12]] While AHS occurs infrequently, a rash is the most common side effect of allopurinol. Patients with mild reactions can be desensitized, and this is recommended for patients who cannot be treated with other ULT agents.​[^[12]]​[^[31]] Oxypurinol, the metabolite of allopurinol, shares a 50% cross-reactivity with allopurinol, but it may be safer to desensitize with it.​[^[32]] It is currently unavailable in Canada. 

While the ACR and EULAR guidelines promote the treat-to-target approach, the ACP finds insufficient evidence to support the benefits of dose escalation in order to achieve a target urate level versus the harms of drug therapy and the necessary repeated monitoring. Therefore, the ACP recommends against initiating urate-lowering therapy in patients after an initial attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. Instead they advocate directing dosage requirement toward minimizing symptoms and not serum urate level. However, some experts find such an approach may compromise patient care as there is scientific evidence (although not from randomized controlled trials) to support a treat-to-target approach. A published abstract from the ACR annual meeting in 2016 examined the safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation in patients with gout participating in a randomized controlled trial, including patients with severe chronic kidney disease.​[^[33]] Compared with dose adjustment based on ClCr, allopurinol dose escalation (50–100 mg increase monthly until target urate levels are achieved) was more likely to reduce serum urate to target (<360 µmol/L).​[^[33]] Dose escalation was well tolerated and there were no significant renal function changes between the standard dosing or the dose-escalation groups.

Due to the possible increased risk for liver dysfunction and cardiovascular mortality, it is recommended that febuxostat be used as a second-line xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The ACR guidelines recommend switching febuxostat to an alternative oral ULT agent in patients with a history of CVD or a new CVD-related event.​[^[12]] The recommended starting dose of febuxostat is 40 mg daily, and the dose can be titrated up as tolerated.​[^[12]] Febuxostat has also been shown to be safe and effective in allopurinol-intolerant patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and hyperuricemia.​[^[34]] The most commonly reported adverse reactions were liver function abnormalities, nausea, diarrhea, arthralgias and rash. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine due to the risk of severe toxicity from increased plasma concentrations of these drugs. Febuxostat is available as 80 mg only, which is also the maximum suggested dose. Note that a daily dose of 120 mg of febuxostat is approved in Europe; the dose of febuxostat may be titrated up to 120 mg daily in patients who continue to have active disease with regular doses.​[^[5]]

Febuxostat has been shown to be relatively safe and effective in patients with mild-moderate and severe CKD.​[^[34]] In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients with hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or 4) who received febuxostat were less likely to have >10% decline in eGFR compared with the placebo group.​[^[35]] 

According to the treat-to-target approach, if upward titration of the initial xanthine oxidase inhibitor does not lead to serum target urate level or is not tolerated, substitution with another xanthine oxidase inhibitor is an appropriate option. Combination therapy (i.e., 1 xanthine oxidase inhibitor and 1 uricosuric agent such as probenecid, or losartan) is also appropriate if the serum urate target level has not been achieved. The treat-to-target approach is promoted as the upward titration of dose; it results in fewer episodes of acute flares during the initiation phase, and lifelong treatment prevents long-term recurrences. 

#### Uricosurics

Probenecid is recommended as an alternative first-line urate-lowering therapy, starting with a low dose of 500 mg once or twice daily.​[^[4]]​[^[12]] It is available only through Health Canada's Special Access Program. Other uricosuric agents that can be used include fenofibrate​[^[36]] and losartan.​[^[37]] Choosing losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible is recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity.​[^[12]] Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is not recommended because the side effects of fenofibrate outweigh the benefits.​[^[12]] While officially approved as a uricosuric, sulfinpyrazone is rarely used for treating gout as it requires monitoring for blood dyscrasias and has other noteworthy adverse effects including increased risk of bleeding and skin rashes. Benzbromarone is a uricosuric agent available through Health Canada's Special Access Program; it may be used in patients not responsive to conventional uricosuric therapy. 

Lesinurad has been approved in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors in the United States for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Lesinurad inhibits the function of the transporter URATI responsible for uric acid tubular reabsorption and therefore enhances renal excretion of uric acid. When combined with allopurinol, lesinurad was shown to reduce serum urate in patients with inadequate response to allopurinol alone.​[^[38]] Lesinurad is not available in Canada and has been removed from the US market by the manufacturer.

Uricosurics are contraindicated in patients with elevated urine uric acid levels (gross overproduction of uric acid). Urine alkalinization is not recommended in patients receiving uricosurics.​[^[12]] It is important to accurately determine the creatinine clearance in order to select appropriate therapy. Uricosurics should not be used as first-line monotherapy in patients with ClCr less than 50 mL/min or with urolithiasis.

#### Uricases

Uricase, or urate oxidase, metabolizes uric acid to end-product allantoin and is absent in humans. Pegloticase, a recombinant pegylated uricase, is available in the United States for treatment of refractory hyperuricemia (not acute gout).​[^[39]] It is not recommended as first-line therapy, but used in conditions of severe gout disease burden and/or refractoriness to, or intolerance of, urate-lowering therapy at appropriate doses.​[^[3]]​[^[12]] It is not yet available in Canada. Rasburicase is a uricolytic agent used only for treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia due to tumor lysis syndrome in cancer chemotherapy (see Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy).

#### Other

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary supplements to treat chronic gout.​[^[40]] Current studies, including those of vitamin C used to lower serum urate, are of low quality.

#### Long-Term Benefits of Urate-Lowering Therapy

Continuing ULT indefinitely is recommended.​[^[12]] There is moderate evidence that urate-lowering therapy reduces the risk of gout flare after 1 year, but not in the first 6 months of starting treatment.​[^[41]] It is documented that keeping urate levels low over time leads to a decrease or cessation of gout flares, and a decrease in the size of, or resolution of, tophi. Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy may derive extra-articular benefits. Hyperuricemia and gout are associated with incident hypertension,​[^[42]] decline in renal function​[^[43]]​[^[44]] and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.​[^[2]] However, it is not clear whether urate-lowering therapy plays a protective role. Allopurinol therapy has been shown to decrease blood pressure in adolescents.​[^[45]] Additionally, a long duration of allopurinol use (>180 days) was associated with reduced risk of MI.​[^[46]] The greatest risk reduction was observed in patients 65–74 and ≥85 years of age, females and Black patients.​[^[46]] Other studies have shown no risk reduction in cardiovascular outcomes with allopurinol use.​[^[47]] There are ongoing larger studies evaluating the effects of urate lowering on cardiovascular disease.

#### Prophylaxis of Gout Flares during the Intercritical Period

Initiating any ULT may result in an increased incidence of gout flares. Minimize the risk of acute attacks by protecting with a low-dose **NSAID** or colchicine when starting antihyperuricemic therapy. It is recommended that ULT should be started during the gout flare rather than after the it has resolved.​[^[12]]

In a study of patients prescribed allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis, colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily was continued for 3 months after attaining a serum urate of <390 µmol/L.​[^[48]] This therapy effectively reduced the frequency and severity of acute gout flares and reduced the likelihood of recurrence. A lower dose of colchicine 0.6 mg once daily may also be effective.​[^[11]]

Fatalities have been reported in patients taking recommended doses of colchicine with concomitant medications that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (Pgp), such as clarithromycin.​[^[49]] Reduce the dose or discontinue colchicine in patients with normal renal and hepatic function if treatment with a Pgp or a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is required (see Table 2). Concomitant use of colchicine and Pgp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

If there are contraindications to colchicine, substitute a low-dose NSAID (e.g., naproxen 250 mg twice daily). Although indomethacin use was commonly used historically, there is no evidence that one NSAID is more effective than another. Use colchicine and NSAIDs with caution in elderly patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency or at high risk of a cardiovascular event.

If NSAIDs and colchicine are both contraindicated or ineffective, low-dose prednisone (<10 mg/day) is a second-line option.​[^[11]]

The 2020 ACR guidelines strongly recommend continuing concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for 3–6 months after urate-lowering therapy initiation; physicians should continue prophylaxis as needed if the patient continues to experience gout flares.​[^[12]]

#### Therapeutic Tips



#### Chronic Tophaceous Gout

#### Risk Factors and Management

This stage typically occurs 12 years from onset with a reported range of 3–42 years.​[^[6]] Only 2% of patients develop severe crippling disease. The strongest associated risk factor for developing tophi is the serum urate level.​[^[6]] Other factors include the frequency of attacks, duration of hyperuricemia and severity of renal disease. Common locations of tophi are the synovium, subchondral bone, digits of the hands and feet, olecranon bursa, Achilles tendon, and helix of the ear. However, they can occur anywhere, including the conduction system of the heart. Tophi themselves are painless but they can lead to destruction of joints and deformities. Radiographic changes include paramarginal erosions with sclerotic margins and calcified tophi.​[^[6]] The optimal therapy for chronic tophaceous gout is prevention through aggressive management of acute gout and correction of hyperuricemia. The aims of therapy are to control pain and inflammation, typically with NSAIDs, and to decrease serum uric acid levels. After several years of therapy, resorption of urate deposits will eventually lead to disappearance of tophi.

| Drug/​Cost[b] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **colchicine** (Colchicine Odan, other generics) | Acute attack:1.2 mg PO at first sign of flare, then 0.6 mg 1 h later; start prophylactic therapy 12 h laterProphylaxis: 0.6 mg once to twice daily PO | Common at higher doses: abdominal pain and cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.Rare: neuropathy, myopathy, bone marrow suppression. | May increase levels of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors; monitor for statin myotoxicity (muscle pain, weakness).Decrease dose and monitor for colchicine toxicity (GI symptoms, fever, leukopenia) if also taking known inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antiretroviral drugs, clarithromycin, erythromycin, azole antifungals, verapamil) or Pgp (e.g., cyclosporine). Fatalities reported with clarithromycin, which inhibits both CYP3A4 and Pgp.​[49] Avoid grapefruit juice. | For elderly (>70 y) patients with impaired renal function or patients on Pgp inhibitors: treat flares with 0.6 mg PO at once then 0.3 mg PO every other day prophylactically. Use with caution.For patients on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: treat flares with 0.6 mg PO followed by 0.3 mg 1 h later and 0.3 mg every other day prophylactically.Colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are also taking CYP3A4 or Pgp inhibitors. |
| **methylprednisolone acetate** (Depo-Medrol) | Acute attack:Large joints: 20–80 mg intra-articularly Medium joints: 10–40 mg intra-articularlySmall joints: 4–10 mg intra-articularly | Not usually significant after single intra-articular injection. |  |  |
| **methylprednisolone acetate** (Depo-Medrol with Lidocaine) | Acute attack:Large joints: 20–80 mg methylprednisolone acetate intra-articularlyMedium joints: 10–40 mg methylprednisolone acetate intra-articularlySmall joints: 4–10 mg methylprednisolone acetate intra-articularly | Not usually significant after single intra-articular injection. |  |  |
| **triamcinolone acetonide** (Kenalog-10, Kenalog-40, generics) | Acute attack:Large joints: 5–15 mg intra-articularly; maximum 40 mgSmall joints: 2.5–5 mg intra-articularly; maximum 10 mg | Not usually significant after single intra-articular injection. |  |  |
| **methylprednisolone sodium succinate** (Solu-Medrol, generics) | Acute attack: 0.5–2 mg/kg × 1 dose IV or IM | Not usually significant after single injection. |  | Use when oral prednisone cannot be used. |

Monitor lithium levels when NSAID added.SSRI: may increase risk of GI bleeding when used with NSAIDs. | There is no good evidence to suggest one NSAID is more efficacious than another.Avoid NSAIDs if history of peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular risk factors, renal failure, heart failure or asthma. |
| **naproxen** (Naprosyn, Pediapharm Naproxen Suspension, other generics) | Acute attack: 750 mg STAT, then 500 mg BID × 4–5 days POProphylaxis: 250 mg BID PO | GI: dyspepsia, epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, gastric and duodenal ulcers, GI bleeding.Cardiovascular: MI, stroke, heart failure, fluid retention, hypertension.Nephrotoxicity may occur; avoid NSAIDs in patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr <30 mL/min).CNS: dizziness, drowsiness, headache, tinnitus, confusion (especially in the elderly); CNS effects may be dose-related and respond to decreased dosage.Minor or serious skin rashes, pruritus. | Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel).Antihypertensives: may decrease antihypertensive effect.Lithium: may interfere with sodium/water balance. Monitor lithium levels when NSAID added.SSRI: may increase risk of GI bleeding when used with NSAIDs. | There is no good evidence to suggest one NSAID is more efficacious than another.Avoid NSAIDs if history of peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular risk factors, renal failure, heart failure or asthma. |
| **fenofibrate** (generics) | 200 mg daily PO | Upper GI disturbances (nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence), myalgias, increased bile lithogenicity, increased CK, increased creatinine (not representative of renal function deterioration). | Caution when combining with statins. Monitor INR with concomitant warfarin use.Increases ezetimibe levels. Monitor for signs of cholelithiasis. Monitor renal function with concomitant cyclosporine use. | Not an approved use in Canada.Monitor CK, liver and renal function at baseline, after 3–6 months, then yearly. Contraindications: hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, pre-existing gallbladder disease. |

Monitor serum creatinine and potassium 7–14 days after initiation of therapy or dose changes. |
| **allopurinol** (Zyloprim, generics) | Starting dose: 100 mg daily PO Usual: 300 mg daily PO titrated to urate levels; maximum: 800 mg daily POTo improve tolerability, divide doses >300 mg to 2–3 times/dayRenal impairment: decrease maintenance dose to 100 mg/day if ClCr is 10–20 mL/min;100 mg Q2–3 days if ClCr <10 mL/min | Skin rash, GI upset, hepatotoxicity, fever, severe hypersensitivity syndrome, xanthine stones (rare). May precipitate attack during initial phase of therapy. | Increases half-life of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine.Dosage reduction of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine required when used concomitantly (one-quarter to one-third of the usual dose).May increase toxicity of cyclophosphamide.Allopurinol inhibits hepatic metabolism of warfarin.Increased incidence of rashes when used with ampicillin or amoxicillin. | May need to increase dose or combine with uricosuric agents in chronic tophaceous gout.To prevent acute attacks on initiation of therapy, give prophylactic NSAID or colchicine for at least 6 months (see Prophylaxis of Gout Flares during the Intercritical Period).Desensitization to allopurinol can be achieved in some patients, but sensitivity may recur. |
| **febuxostat** (generics) | Starting dose: 40 mg daily PO; may increase to 80 mg daily after 2 wk if serum uric acid levels remain above 360 µmol/L | Nausea, arthralgia, skin rash (at higher dose). Increased hepatic aminotransferase levels. May precipitate attack during initial phase of therapy. | Azathioprine and mercaptopurine metabolism by xanthine oxidase may be decreased by febuxostat, resulting in significant toxicity. Do not use febuxostat with these drugs. | To prevent acute attacks on initiation of therapy, give prophylactic NSAID or colchicine for 2–3 wk.May increase risk of stroke, MI, cardiovascular mortality, or all cause mortality compared with allopurinol. |
