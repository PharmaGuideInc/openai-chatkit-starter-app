#### Introduction

Aphthous ulcers (also referred to as recurrent aphthous ulcers, aphthous stomatitis or canker sores) are oral inflammatory lesions of unknown etiology.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] With a frequency of 20%, these ulcers are the most prevalent oral lesions in the general population.​[^[3]] They may recur after a few days or months,​[^[4]] with half of individuals experiencing a recurrence within 3 months.​[^[5]] The first occurrence is usually between 10 and 20 years of age, with more than one-third of school-aged children experiencing these oral lesions.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Aphthous ulcers that start in adulthood tend to be associated with systemic conditions or have predisposing factors.​[^[8]] With age, the frequency and severity of aphthous ulcers tend to decrease.​[^[8]]

#### Pathophysiology

The etiology of aphthous ulcers is unknown but probably multifactorial. Table 1 outlines some of the potential precipitating factors.

|  |
| --- |
| Food (e.g., chocolate, coffee, peanuts, cereal, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes, wheat flour)​[a] |
| Local oral trauma (e.g., from teeth or dental appliances) |
| Stress |
| Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iron, zinc, folic acid, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12) |
| Allergies |
| Medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, immunosuppressive therapies, NSAIDs, opioids) |
| Systemic disease (e.g., Behçet syndrome, HIV infection, inflammatory bowel disease) |
| Menstrual cycle |
| Genetic predisposition |


The role of microbial factors (e.g., Helicobacter pylori) in the pathophysiology of aphthous ulcers has been investigated, but evidence of a link between a bacterial or viral infection and the etiology of aphthous ulcers has yet to be found.​[^[2]]​[^[3]]

Patients with aphthae may have considerable pain, which leads to difficulty eating, speaking and swallowing.​[^[1]] Persistent and recurring ulcers can result in weight loss and a decrease in quality of life.​[^[9]] A vague localized feeling of discomfort may precede the actual appearance of the lesion by a few hours and up to 2 days.​[^[1]]​[^[3]]

There are 3 types of aphthous ulcers: minor, major and herpetiform.​[^[1]] Table 2 compares the key attributes of each type; photos of minor aphthae can be found below [Photo, Aphthous Ulcer (Canker Sore)] and [Photo, Aphthous Ulcer (Canker Sore)]. This chapter will discuss the management of minor aphthous ulcers only.

| Attributes | Minor | Major​[a] | Herpetiform |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Percent of cases | 75–85% | 10–15% | 5–10% |
| Description | Small, round or oval; clearly defined, shallow necrotic centre with raised red margin, red halo and yellow-grey pseudomembrane | Round or ovoid with clearly defined margins; larger and deeper than minor ulcers | Multiple small clusters of pinpoint ulcers that coalesce to form large, irregular lesions resembling herpesvirus infection |
| Diameter | <1 cm | >1 cm | 1–3 mm |
| Number | 1–5 | 1–10 | up to 100 |
| Location | Unkeratinized oral mucosa (lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, underside of the tongue and soft palate) | Mucosa overlying minor salivary glands and the lips, soft palate and oropharynx | Unkeratinized oral mucosa (lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, underside of the tongue and soft palate) |
| Duration | 7–14 days | Weeks to months | 7–30 days |
| Scarring | Do not scar | Often scar | Rarely scar |
| Pain | Painful | Significant pain and difficulty swallowing | Painful |
| Populations at increased risk | Patients <30 years of age | Patients infected with HIV​[5] | Patients at a later age of onset than minor and major aphthae |

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Figure 1 illustrates the oral cavity. Aphthous ulcers occur almost exclusively on movable oral mucosa (inside of the cheeks, lips, tongue, floor of mouth and soft palate) and are normally not preceded by fever or vesicles. When patients present with a mouth lesion that is not easily distinguished as a minor aphthous ulcer or have additional symptoms (e.g., fever, skin lesions, uveitis, genital ulceration, recurrent bloody or mucous diarrhea, head/neck adenopathy or malar rash), they may be suffering from some other type of lesion or a systemic disorder and should be assessed further​[^[11]] (see Figure 2).

Alternative diagnoses to aphthous ulcers include oral candidiasis (thrush); oral herpes simplex virus infections (cold sores); chickenpox; shingles; hand-foot-and-mouth disease; and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome. Patients with nutrient deficiencies (e.g., iron, zinc, folic acid, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12) or gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease or celiac disease) may present with aphthae-like ulcers.​[^[8]] Other conditions with oral ulcerative manifestations include infections (viral, bacterial, fungal), autoimmune diseases (e.g., Behçet syndrome, lupus erythematosus), hematologic diseases (e.g., cyclic neutropenia) and neoplasms (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma). Oral manifestations of medication-induced conditions (e.g., drug-induced pemphigus, Steven-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis) should also be considered part of the differential diagnosis.​[^[2]] Patients with white, thickened patches on the mucosa of the cheeks, gums or tongue may have leukoplakia, a precancerous lesion associated with the use of tobacco products.​[^[12]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is an anatomical diagram of the oral cavity, labeled "Anatomy of Oral Cavity." It provides a detailed view of the mouth's internal structures, with labels pointing to various parts. Here's a breakdown of the labeled components:

1. **Upper Lip**: The upper boundary of the mouth.
2. **Teeth**: The visible set of teeth in the upper jaw.
3. **Hard Palate**: The bony front part of the roof of the mouth.
4. **Soft Palate**: The soft, flexible part at the back of the roof of the mouth.
5. **Uvula**: The small, fleshy extension at the back of the soft palate.
6. **Tonsil**: Lymphoid tissue located at the sides of the throat.
7. **Floor of Mouth**: The area under the tongue.
8. **Lower Lip**: The lower boundary of the mouth.
9. **Superior Labial Frenulum**: The tissue connecting the upper lip to the gum.
10. **Gingiva (Gum)**: The gum tissue surrounding the teeth.
11. **Glossopalatine Arch**: The arch formed by the soft palate and the tongue.
12. **Palatine Arch**: The arch at the back of the mouth.
13. **Retromolar Trigone**: The area behind the last molar.
14. **Tongue**: The muscular organ in the mouth.
15. **Inferior Labial Frenulum**: The tissue connecting the lower lip to the gum.

The diagram uses arrows to point from each label to the corresponding part of the oral cavity, providing a clear and organized view of the mouth's anatomy.

#### Prevention

Several factors may contribute to the development and duration of aphthous ulcers.

#### Local Trauma

Teeth, dental procedures and dental devices can cause trauma and aphthous ulcers. If accidental self-biting leads to the development of aphthous ulcers, advise the patient to chew carefully and slowly, using extra caution or avoiding sharp-edged foods such as crackers, toast, chips and hard candy.​[^[1]] Patients should consult with their dentist if their teeth or dental appliances have sharp points. Taking care while brushing teeth gently with a soft toothbrush and replacing toothbrushes early to prevent injury from splayed bristles can also help prevent trauma to the oral mucosa. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant commonly found in toothpaste, may worsen pain of existing ulcers and may interfere with the ulcer healing process.​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] Patients with SLS-related adverse reactions should use toothpaste that does not contain this detergent (see Table 3).​[^[1]]​[^[15]]​[^[16]]

#### Emotional and Environmental Stress

Stress may precede 60% of initial ulcers and may be involved in 21% of recurrent cases. For example, frequency of aphthous ulcers is 3 times greater in medical and dental students than in the general population. Relaxation and imagery training may significantly reduce aphthous ulcers.​[^[9]]

#### Nutritional Deficiencies

Deficiencies involving iron, zinc, folic acid and vitamins B1, B2, B6 and B12 are more common in patients with aphthous ulcers than in people without aphthous ulcers.​[^[9]] Calcium and vitamin C may also be deficient in patients with aphthous ulcers. Hematologic screening in patients with a history of ulcers exceeding 6 months may detect these deficiencies.​[^[1]] Patients with nutritional deficiencies respond well to replacement therapy.​[^[9]]

#### Allergies

Oral hypersensitivity reactions to various food additives, essential oils, mint, dental materials, cow’s milk and wheat protein have been observed in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU).​[^[9]] Strict elimination diets removing cow’s milk or gluten may resolve or improve RAU.​[^[9]] If an allergic reaction is suspected, referral to specialist care may be warranted.

#### Drug-Related Causes

It has been suggested that patients with RAU have a higher medication intake than those without RAU.​[^[17]] Medications associated with RAU include ACE inhibitors, antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, immunosuppressants, NSAIDs and opioids.​[^[1]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Although the mechanism is not well understood, drug-related aphthous ulcers usually resolve once the medication is discontinued.​[^[18]]

There may be an increase in the incidence of RAU in patients who have recently quit smoking due to the impact of smoking on keratinization of the oral mucosa.​[^[5]]

#### Treatment of Underlying Systemic Disease

Identification and treatment of certain systemic diseases have been associated with improvement of RAU. These systemic conditions include Sweet syndrome, Crohn disease, Behçet disease, various types of neutropenia, pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV infection, PFAPA syndrome, and mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage (MAGIC) syndrome.​[^[8]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

All patients with aphthous ulcers can benefit from avoiding foods that cause pain. These include foods that are hard, crusty, sharp, spicy, salty, acidic or difficult to chew, such as crackers, toast, chips, pickles, tomatoes, nuts, citrus fruits and juices. Alcoholic beverages and chocolate may also cause pain and should be avoided when ulcers are present.​[^[1]]

Patients should address any sources of oral trauma, such as ill-fitting appliances and sharp/broken teeth and use SLS-free toothpastes​[^[15]] (see Table 3).

Chemically cauterizing the ulcers with topical compounds (e.g., silver nitrate, hydrogen peroxide) is painful and should be administered only under specialist care due to the possibility of causing local necrosis and delaying healing. Cauterization may decrease pain severity after 1 day but has little effect on speed of healing.​[^[11]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]]

Patients should maintain regular oral hygiene practices: brushing twice daily, flossing daily and receiving a professional dental cleaning every 6 months (see Oral Hygiene, Dental Plaque and Caries).​[^[1]] Aphthae can be cleansed by rinsing the mouth with a salt and water mixture (2.5–5 mL table salt per 250 mL warm water) several times daily, especially after meals. There is no evidence that other cleansing rinses (e.g., sodium perborate or diluted hydrogen peroxide) provide an advantage over saline rinses.​[^[8]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

The efficacy of treatment options for minor aphthous ulcers is mainly anecdotal, as few well-designed studies are available.​[^[18]] Treatment is therefore empirical and nonspecific and the choice of agent will depend on severity of pain, number of ulcers, frequency of episodes and the patient’s tolerance to treatment.​[^[18]]​[^[21]]

#### Topical Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Mouth Products: Cold Sores and Canker Sores.

#### Protectants

Placing a mucosal adherent agent such as hydroxypropyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose over the ulcer may provide temporary pain relief and protection.

Hyaluronic acid is available as gels, sprays and rinses. It has been proposed to decrease healing time and promote pain relief of aphthous ulcers. While the results of small efficacy trials are promising, the data is limited and more research is required to determine the role of hyaluronic acid in the treatment of aphthous ulcers.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] 

#### Local Anesthetics

Infrequent minor aphthous ulcers resolve on their own and may require only short-term pain management. Patients seeking temporary pain relief can apply a product containing a topical anesthetic such as benzocaine or lidocaine.​[^[19]] The duration of action of topical anesthetics is relatively short (20–45 min) and these agents may be used with protectants and oral analgesics to provide longer pain relief.

Gels, ointments and pastes can be applied directly to the ulcer using a cotton swab. They may be used 4 times a day, before meals and at bedtime, for up to 1 week.​[^[7]] To maximize effectiveness, the mucosa should be dried prior to drug application, and eating, drinking and speaking should be avoided for 30 minutes after application.​[^[1]] While the short duration of action combined with the 30-minute wait time may limit the pain relief for eating or drinking, the delay is important to reduce the risk of choking or burning the mouth with hot foods or beverages.

Local anesthetics are not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age, and pediatric topical benzocaine products are no longer available. Increased absorption of benzocaine in infants and young children has led to methemoglobinemia.​[^[24]] There is also a risk of choking from difficulty swallowing and of being burned from hot foods as a result of the anesthesia.

Gel formulations have a high alcohol content and may cause an initial stinging or burning on application. Applying ice before using a gel may help prevent this side effect, or another dosage form may be selected.​[^[7]]

#### Local Anti-inflammatories

Topical corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol, dexamethasone, triamcinolone) are useful in relieving pain due to their anti-inflammatory properties and may decrease the healing time.​[^[1]]​[^[4]] Topical corticosteroids may also contribute to the reduction of new ulcers in individuals prone to recurrent aphthous ulcers.​[^[4]] Their efficacy can improve if they are started during the early phase of ulceration, when lymphocyte activity is at its maximum. Dexamethasone was shown to reduce pain and ulcer size when applied to the affected areas 3 times daily for 5 days, and topical oral application did not cause detectable serum concentration of dexamethasone.​[^[25]] When compared with triamcinolone, dexamethasone showed faster healing of RAU with similar speed of pain reduction.​[^[26]]

Establishing effective topical delivery of these agents is a problem because they are readily rubbed or washed away within the mouth. **Triamcinolone in Orabase** is available commercially; alternatively, corticosteroid ointment formulations may be compounded with equal parts of the mucosal adherent Orabase to provide better adherence to the oral mucosa and improve drug delivery.​[^[7]] Patients should be advised not to eat or drink for 30 minutes following application to further improve adherence and efficacy. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is a potential side effect and patients should be monitored for the development of this condition when using topical corticosteroids (see Oral Candidiasis).​[^[1]]

#### Local Antibiotics

Minocycline mouthwash may significantly reduce pain, ulcer size and duration of RAU as compared with placebo.​[^[19]] The usual dosage is minocycline 10 mg 4 times a day for 10 days, administered as a solution that is retained in the mouth for 1–2 minutes then expectorated. One small study (n=14) investigated the efficacy of minocycline 0.2 % versus minocycline 0.5% and found that the higher concentration resulted in faster improvement in symptoms with minor adverse events (e.g., bitter taste).​[^[27]] Doxycycline mouthwash has also been found to be effective​[^[2]] but there is a lack of quality evidence to determine whether tetracycline mouthwash is effective.​[^[4]] Using antibiotic oral rinses for more than 5 days may predispose patients to oral fungal infections, skin reactions, sore throat or stained teeth.​[^[1]]​[^[9]] Another concern with frequent or prolonged use is the development of bacterial resistance. Benefits of this treatment should be weighed against its risks. There are no commercially available products; these mouthwashes must be compounded.

Chlorhexidine mouthwashes may decrease the pain and duration of aphthous ulcers but the evidence is weak and it has not been conclusively demonstrated that they decrease the formation of new aphthous ulcers.​[^[4]] Chlorhexidine mouthwashes may help reduce the risk of secondary bacterial or fungal infections.​[^[2]]

#### Systemic Therapy

Acetaminophen may be recommended for pain relief. NSAIDs should be avoided as they may cause aphthous ulcers and can worsen the lesions.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[11]]

Cyanocobalamin may be beneficial regardless of the patient’s vitamin B12 status. A randomized controlled trial of 58 patients with RAU found cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg daily decreased the duration of ulcer episodes, the number of ulcers and the level of pain after 6 months of treatment. The results were independent of baseline serum vitamin B12 level.​[^[28]]

Table 4 lists systemic therapies that are not generally recommended or required but may be considered second line for severe or complex cases of major RAU that are unresponsive to all topical therapies.​[^[1]] Efficacy data for many of these agents is lacking​[^[35]] and aphthous ulcers may recur after discontinuation of therapy.

| Therapy | Dosage | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colchicine​[a] | 0.5–2 mg daily | Colchicine may induce complete remission and reduce the duration and frequency of ulcers after 3 months of therapy.​[29]​[30] |
| Dapsone​[a] | 100–150 mg daily | Dapsone may act as both an antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory agent.​[31] |
| Infliximab | 5 mg/kg body weight at variable frequencies | Infliximab may induce rapid healing of the lesions within a few days after the first dose with no recurrence for 6–8 wk.​[1] |
| Montelukast | 10 mg daily for 1 month followed by alternate-day dosing for the second month | Montelukast may reduce pain, time to healing and number of new aphthous lesions.​[32] |
| Pentoxifylline | 400 mg 3 times daily | Pentoxifylline may reduce pain severity and size of ulcers.​[33]​[34] |
| Prednisolone | 10–30 mg daily for up to 1 month | Prednisolone may shorten the duration of the ulcer.​[1] |
| Thalidomide | 50–100 mg/day for severe recurrent aphthous ulcers200 mg/day for major aphthae in HIV-positive patients | Thalidomide may induce complete remission in as early as 14 days of starting treatment but causes adverse effects in the majority of patients.​[21] |


#### Anecdotal Therapies

Therapies that have been suggested for aphthous ulcers but have received little or no evaluation are listed in Table 5. Some of these products may interact with other medications or even cause aphthous ulcers; therefore, they should be avoided.​[^[36]]

| Herbs | Drugs | Other |

| AgrimonyEchinaceaLicoriceSageTormentilWitch hazel | Acyclovir Cyclosporine ANicotine patches and chewable tabletsSucralfate suspension as mouth rinseZinc lozenges | 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (tissue adhesive)Helium-neon lasers |


#### Monitoring of Therapy

Monitor for potential side effects and complications of treatment, e.g., oral corticosteroid use can cause oral candidiasis. The patient should monitor ulcer pain daily. Health-care practitioners should monitor patients for ulcer pain every 3 days for the first week then 1 week later. If the ulcer worsens or is still present after 14 days of self-care, patient may require further assessment and treatment. An oral ulcer is considered chronic if it lasts longer than 2 weeks.​[^[37]]
