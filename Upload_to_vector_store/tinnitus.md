#### Pathophysiology

Tinnitus can be described as a patient having the sensation of hearing buzzing, hissing, cricket-like sounds, ringing, whistling, humming or a combination of these.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] It can also present as continuous, intermittent or pulsatile tinnitus.​[^[2]] Tinnitus can have a major impact on quality of life; patients may experience frustration, annoyance, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritation and difficulty concentrating, in addition to the “ringing in the ears.”​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Although tinnitus can occur at any age, it is less common in children and most common in the elderly. Hearing loss is the most important risk factor for development of tinnitus.​[^[3]]

Tinnitus can be classified into 2 major categories: objective tinnitus, which is caused by a sound produced within the head, and subjective tinnitus (more common), which is the perception of sound or noise without any external stimulation. Causes of tinnitus include:​[^[4]]​[^[5]]



The pathophysiology of tinnitus is incompletely understood; however, central mechanisms are involved. A distributed tinnitus brain network, including sensory auditory areas and cortical regions involved in perceptual, emotional, attentional and salience functions, has been hypothesized.​[^[2]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Assess and address any potential drug-related causes of tinnitus.​[^[4]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Review the patient’s drug history, both current and past, for potentially ototoxic drugs (see Table 1 and Assessment of Patients with Hearing Loss, Ear Pain and Ear Drainage, Table 2). Reassess the need for any ototoxic drug found; removal of the offending agent may resolve tinnitus.​[^[4]] All patients with tinnitus lasting >24 hours, pulsatile, unilateral hearing loss, or history of ear disease or procedures should be assessed by an appropriate health-care practitioner. The severity of tinnitus and the impact on quality of life should be assessed. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ) are 2 commonly used instruments.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Many drugs have been studied in the management of tinnitus, including alprazolam, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, flunarizine, gabapentin, lamotrigine), baclofen, betahistine, melatonin, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants and zinc; none have been shown to be effective.​[^[12]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]]​[^[16]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]

Ginkgo biloba has been studied in the management of tinnitus and is commonly used;​[^[19]]​[^[20]] however, evidence of efficacy is lacking.​[^[21]]​[^[22]] Adverse effects of ginkgo biloba include mild GI complaints, headache, dizziness, palpitations and allergic skin reactions. It is also associated with bleeding and seizures. The risk of bleeding may increase when ginkgo biloba is combined with warfarin or antiplatelet drugs. Advise patients to avoid this combination.

Other natural health products (e.g., maritime pine bark, melatonin, vinpocetine) are purported to be useful for tinnitus, but no evidence is available to confirm or refute any potential benefit.​[^[21]]

Although some patients suffering from tinnitus may use cannabis to treat their symptoms, there is no evidence to support this. Furthermore, there is some animal data to suggest that tinnitus may be exacerbated.​[^[23]]

For treatment of tinnitus related to Meniere disease, see Vertigo and Dizziness.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Most trials indicate that drugs will have little benefit in the management of tinnitus. If a drug trial is elected despite this, determine with the patient a stopping time if no improvement is seen. While there is no evidence to guide how long a drug should be tried, clinical trials ran from 6–14 weeks.​[^[15]]​[^[22]]
