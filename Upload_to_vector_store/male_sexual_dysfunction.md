CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the term “men” or “male” is used in the text, it is used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

This chapter addresses erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation and low sexual desire. A careful sexual history is required to distinguish these 4 conditions since more than 1 may be present in a single patient.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to obtain or maintain an erection sufficiently firm for satisfactory sexual activity on all or almost all occasions. Addressing sexual function is an integral part of general medical assessment, not only in patients with chronic illness​[^[1]] but in apparently healthy patients, as impairment can signal serious disease. Of note is the frequency with which vascular ED precedes evidence of coronary artery disease​[^[2]] and is a potent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure in individuals with cardiovascular disease.​[^[3]] As vascular ED affects all erections, all patients should be asked about their ability to obtain or maintain erections.​[^[4]] There is a strong multidimensional relationship between ED, coronary artery disease and depression such that the presence of 1 of the triad necessitates inquiry about the other 2.​[^[5]] Successful treatment of ED improves self-esteem, confidence, symptoms of depression and sexual relationships.​[^[6]]

Premature ejaculation (PE) is defined as ejaculation that occurs sooner than desired, causing the individual distress. Although orgasm and ejaculation are separate physiological events, they occur simultaneously even when delayed by medication. PE may be acquired or lifelong.

Delayed ejaculation is a marked delay or inability to achieve ejaculation despite the desire to do so and despite adequate sexual stimulation. Prevalence is unclear because the definition lacks precision. It is the least common sexual complaint in patients <50 years of age but incidence increases significantly with age.

Low sexual desire, referred to in the DSM-5 as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder (MHSDD), is a persistent or recurrent lack of sexual thoughts, fantasies and desire. However, it is well recognized in people of all genders.​[^[7]] Depression, low testosterone, anxiety, insomnia, age and insufficient physical activity are associated with MHSDD.​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Assessment and management of erectile dysfunction is presented in Figure 2.

Obtain details of patient’s chief complaint and psychosexual history (see Table 1) (including from a partner, if applicable), with attention to:

| People can have low sexual desire and difficulties with erections, reaching orgasm too quickly, too slowly or not at all. What are your main concerns?For how long have you had these difficulties?Do you have sexual thoughts or fantasies? If so, have they reduced markedly? Do you have the desire to self-stimulate/masturbate? Do you become aroused mentally if you see or hear something erotic? How sexually excited (in your mind) are you when having partnered sex?On a scale of 1/10–10/10 where 1/10 is a flaccid penis, 10/10 is completely firm and erect and 6/10 allows (but only just allows) intercourse, how firm are erections when you awaken from sleep (typically deep sleep), self-stimulate, have sexual play with a partner, attempt intercourse, as intercourse proceeds?Your experience of orgasm—has that recently changed?Are you reaching ejaculation—and has that recently changed?If you are having sexual activity with a partner, how rewarding is it on the occasions it is still occurring or when it was occurring?Despite these difficulties, are you still sexually active alone? with a partner? how often?Are the concerns with erection or ejaculation present with self-stimulation?What are your thoughts and feelings during partnered sex? (when the concerns about low desire, erection or ejaculation apply only to partnered sex)Do you feel your partner(s) experience(s) their own sexual difficulties? Do they think that they do? Would I be able to interview them? Are they in agreement with getting help for your sexual function and reinstituting sexual activity including intercourse, if desired?What effects have these difficulties had on you, on your relationships and on your partner(s)? |


| Clues in Sexual History | Potential Etiologic Factors |
| --- | --- |
| Sleep-induced and self-stimulated erections are firmer than erections with sexual partner(s) | Psychological factors: intrapersonal (e.g., insecurity, perfectionism, distractions, depression); interpersonal (difficulties within relationships); non-erotic sexual context |
| Premature ejaculation with partner(s) but slower when self-stimulated | Psychological factors: anxiety |
| Decreased sexual desire that causes distress to the patient (fewer sexual thoughts and fantasies) | Depression, low testosterone, stress, increased prolactin, medications, psychodynamic issues, e.g., a learned response not to feel emotions generally |
| Little desire for partnered sex but ongoing self-stimulation with or without viewing pornographic material | Intimacy difficulty—not strictly sexual dysfunction |
| Ejaculation delayed | Drug effect, low testosterone, advanced age with erection augmentation by drugs |
| Ejaculation delayed only with partner(s) | Psychological factors: intimacy difficulty; own method of self-stimulation different from partnered sex |
| Ejaculation early and painful | Prostatitis, other lower urological tract problems |
| Decreased orgasm intensity | Drug effect, depression, low testosterone |
| Erectile dysfunction generalized and lifelong in younger individuals | Congenital or past traumatic vascular damage, occasionally amenable to microvascular surgery |

Laboratory investigations with attention to:



#### Erectile Dysfunction

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

Address sexual avoidance by reminding patients and their partner(s) that reinstating sexual intimacy requires effort:



Address lack of subjective sexual arousal:



Address lifestyle factors:



Vacuum erection devices (VEDs), also known as vacuum constrictive devices, create a vacuum and draw venous blood back into the penis. The blood is then trapped by the use of a retaining band around the base of the penis to attain adequate firmness for intercourse. There is a learning curve with the use of VEDs. Warn patients that the tightness of the retention band is critical and the band must be removed within 30 minutes after being applied. Some individuals cannot tolerate the degree of tightness required. Any condition that predisposes to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, sickle cell disease) is a contraindication to the use of a VED, as is warfarin therapy or other causes of increased INR.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 6 details the drugs used in the management of ED.

#### Treatment of Underlying Causes

Although research is limited, in clinical practice combining psychological treatment with PDE5 inhibitors is common and evidence suggests that the combination is better than either treatment alone.​[^[18]] See Depression for more information on psychological interventions.

Treating cardiovascular risk factors with statins may benefit ED with or without the use of PDE5 inhibitors.​[^[19]] See Dyslipidemias for more information on statins.

#### Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors

PDE5 inhibitors include sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil. Given their safety, efficacy and oral administration, they are the drugs of first choice for ED, including antidepressant-induced ED.​[^[20]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]] PDE5 inhibitors enhance an erection that is partially developing as a result of effective sexual stimulation and mental sexual arousal (or reflex erection in patients with spinal cord injury). There is less benefit in patients with diabetes; some evidence supports the addition of folic acid 5 mg daily to increase endothelial nitric oxide production.​[^[23]]

Duration of action is longest with tadalafil (up to 36 hours); however, the effect of sildenafil​[^[24]] and vardenafil​[^[25]] may last longer (8–12 hours) than previously thought. Vardenafil and sildenafil have some affinity for PDE6 in the retina, accounting for occasional visual side effects. Tadalafil has some affinity for PDE11A, which may underlie myalgia associated with this drug. Absorption of sildenafil is delayed by high-fat meals. A meta-analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most effective PDE5 inhibitor and tadalafil is the best tolerated.​[^[26]]

Contraindications to the use of PDE5 inhibitors include concurrent use of nitrates, symptomatic hypotension (PDE5 inhibitors are mildly hypotensive drugs), any condition in which even a slight lowering of systemic pressure is poorly tolerated (e.g., conditions restricting aortic outflow and volume depletion states), previous priapism and conditions predisposing to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis and sickle cell disease).

Careful concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with selective alpha-blockers (alfuzosin, tamsulosin) may benefit ED and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) more than either drug alone.​[^[27]]​[^[28]] Caution is needed when using nonselective alpha-blockers due to increased risk of hypotension when combined with PDE5 inhibitors.

Daily dosing of PDE5 inhibitors may improve erectile recovery after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.​[^[29]]

#### Prostaglandin E1 Analogues

#### Alprostadil Intracavernosal Injection

If sufficient corporal erectile tissue is still present, injected alprostadil will cause erections even in the absence of mental sexual arousal.​[^[30]]

Because alprostadil directly stimulates nociceptors, the technique, dose and dilution are critical for efficacy, safety and comfort of erection. Proper dilution and measurement of the dose are particularly important in neurogenic ED, which often requires doses of only 1–3 mcg. Doses up to 40–60 mcg may be needed for vascular ED.​[^[30]] Priapism (a persistent and painful erection lasting >4 hours in the absence of sexual stimulation or desire) is most commonly caused by intracavernosal injections. Priapism is considered a urologic emergency and should be treated quickly (within hours of presentation) to avoid permanent penile damage. Risk of developing priapism is minimized by slow and careful dose titration of injected drugs.

Contraindications to the use of intracavernosal alprostadil include anticoagulation, previous priapism, symptomatic thrombocytopenia and conditions predisposing to priapism, e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, sickle cell disease and valve lesions with significant risk of subacute bacterial endocarditis.

#### Alprostadil by Urethral Instillation

Instilling alprostadil in the form of a pellet into the urethra allows the drug to enter the corpus spongiosum. Retrograde venous passage from spongiosum to cavernosa is unpredictable and depends on the individual's venous anatomy.​[^[30]] Therefore, a trial of intraurethral alprostadil pellets is necessary to determine efficacy in a particular patient.

By entering the communicating veins between the corpora, the drug is introduced into the systemic circulation, and hypotensive systemic side effects are possible.​[^[30]]

Contraindications to the use of intraurethral alprostadil include symptomatic hypotension, previous priapism, conditions predisposing to priapism (e.g., leukemia, polycythemia, myelofibrosis and sickle cell disease) and distal urethral pathology.

#### Premature Ejaculation

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices

The following sex therapy techniques may benefit patients interested in nonpharmacologic treatment options. They are not appropriate for individuals in a partnered relationship for whom referral for relationship counselling is the appropriate therapy.



Address possible sequelae of PE in both the patient and their partner(s), if appropriate (see Table 5).

|  |
| --- |
| Low sexual self-confidence (which creates more anxiety, compounding premature ejaculation and possibly provoking erectile dysfunction)Arousal, desire or orgasmic disorder resulting from rushing on to (brief) intercourse, or simply discontinuing sexual engagement as soon as the early ejaculation occursIntercourse itself never resulting in orgasm for partner(s) |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

Clinically significant delay in ejaculation may be achieved with regular daily dosing of citalopram (20–40 mg), clomipramine (12.5–50 mg), paroxetine (10–40 mg) or sertraline (50–200 mg), or on-demand therapy with clomipramine, paroxetine or sertraline 3–6 hours before sexual activity.​[^[31]] Regular daily dosing is considered more effective than on-demand treatment and may require 2–3 weeks for full therapeutic benefit.​[^[31]] Most common side effects with these agents include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Relapse is likely when medication is discontinued. Combining pharmacologic and behavioural techniques is recommended to prolong benefit and ultimately allow gradual withdrawal of medication.

PDE5 inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of PE and possibly more effective than SSRIs. Ejaculation is delayed most effectively by a combination of PDE5 inhibitors and SSRIs.​[^[32]]​[^[33]]

Although not generally recommended, intracavernosal therapy in those with severe PE may improve partner satisfaction due to erectile persistence after ejaculation.

Numbing the penile skin with local anesthetic can be effective in delaying ejaculation but reinforces the patient’s inability to recognize lower states of sexual arousal.

Despite some evidence of benefit in patients with premature ejaculation, prescribing tramadol off-label for this indication is not recommended given the risk of dependence.​[^[34]]

#### Delayed Ejaculation

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Review the patient's medications and, if possible, change any drugs that may be causing the dysfunction, e.g., 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, alpha-blockers, antipsychotics, SSRIs (see Table 3).

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart illustrating the cycle of sexual desire and intimacy. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Central Element:**
   - **Seemingly “spontaneous” desire**: This is the central point of the flowchart, indicating a neutral state with many motivations, including enhancing emotional intimacy.

2. **Flowchart Pathways:**
   - **From "Seemingly 'spontaneous' desire" to "Sexual stimuli":**
     - Arrows indicate that this state leads to seeking out and being receptive to sexual stimuli.
   
   - **From "Sexual stimuli" to "Sexual arousal":**
     - Biological and psychological factors affect the processing of stimuli, leading to sexual arousal.
   
   - **From "Sexual arousal" to "Sexual desire":**
     - Sexual arousal progresses to sexual desire.
   
   - **From "Sexual desire" to "Enhanced intimacy":**
     - This transition is associated with more arousal and pleasure, resulting in a positive outcome emotionally and physically.
   
   - **From "Enhanced intimacy" back to "Seemingly 'spontaneous' desire":**
     - Enhanced intimacy feeds back into the central state, completing the cycle.

3. **Annotations:**
   - Each transition is annotated with descriptions of the processes or outcomes involved, such as the influence of biological and psychological factors or the enhancement of intimacy.

This flowchart represents the cyclical nature of sexual desire and intimacy, highlighting the interplay between emotional and physical factors.

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Testosterone replacement therapy may be effective for patients experiencing MHSDD associated with endogenous testosterone deficiency;​[^[35]] however, the role of testosterone supplementation is uncertain in individuals who are not clearly hypogonadal.​[^[36]]

Correction of hyperprolactinemia is expected to benefit low desire.​[^[37]]
