This chapter is dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of diversity in clinical education and literature concerning the diagnosis and treatment of dermatological conditions in individuals with skin of colour. CPhA has opted to use the term “skin of colour,” acknowledging that individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds may have their own preferred terminology. Recognizing the ever-evolving nature of language, we remain committed to regularly review the most appropriate terminology for describing patients.

#### Introduction

The definition of skin of colour (SOC) is complex and evolving. In Canada, more than 30% of the population self-identified as belonging to an ethno-cultural ancestry other than “White” in the 2021 census. In addition to Indigenous peoples, this population consisted mainly of the following racialized groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese.​[^[1]] In dermatology, the term SOC is used to refer to those with deep or rich skin pigmentation, in recognition of the fact that this characteristic is an important consideration in the diagnosis and treatment of skin disorders.

Almost 50% of dermatologists in 1 study reported feeling their training was inadequate to diagnose dermatological disease in patients with skin of colour.​[^[2]] This puts patients with skin of colour at risk of misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.​[^[3]] 

This chapter aims to address this knowledge gap by discussing the following topics: physiologic/functional differences between skin colours, health inequities in dermatology, common cultural practices affecting the skin and hair, consideration of skin colour when completing a physical assessment, dermatological conditions that occur predominantly in skin of colour, and information on how the presentation and/or management of common dermatological conditions may differ in darkly pigmented skin compared with lightly pigmented skin.

#### Physiologic and Functional Differences between Skin Colours

It is crucial to appreciate that environmental and social determinants of health may play a more significant role than biologic or genetic factors in dermatologic health outcomes​[^[4]] (see Dermatologic Health Inequity).



#### Dermatologic Health Inequity



Research assessing the clinical consequences of these inequalities is, unsurprisingly, also limited, but includes the following examples: despite lower prevalence, Black patients with skin cancer present with more advanced disease and have lower survival rates compared with White patients;​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Black patients are less likely to receive treatment for acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis compared with White patients;​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Canadian First Nations communities experience disproportionately high rates of communicable diseases including community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*.​[^[14]]

Expanding dermatological medical education and clinician training, improving diversity in study participants, and enhancing research funding directly related to common conditions in skin of colour will help to reduce dermatologic health inequities; however, significant improvements in the environmental and social determinants of health in racialized groups on a societal level are also required.

#### Cultural Considerations in Dermatology

Cultural dermatology is a concept used to describe the range of cutaneous manifestations arising from therapeutic or cosmetic practices that were once localized to specific regions of the world but whose prevalence and pattern have been impacted by globalization.​[^[20]] Increasing population diversity has led to sharing of cultural practices and traditions, making it increasingly important for clinicians to recognize the physiologic and pathologic sequelae associated with them.​[^[21]]

It is important that clinicians use neutral and nonjudgmental language when discussing these practices with their patients. Being sensitive to cultural differences and willing to work alongside traditional, complementary and alternative treatments, if possible, is recommended.​[^[22]]

#### Patient Assessment





Information on patient assessment for specific dermatological conditions can be found in the relevant chapters of *CPS*. Additional information specific to the assessment of skin conditions in patients with skin of colour is provided in Table 2. Incorporating this information into the assessment of patients with skin of colour will enhance disease identification and patient outcomes.

| Body Area | Additional Considerations Pertaining to Skin of Colour | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skin |  |  |
| Erythema(changes in the appearance of the skin caused by increased blood flow, often associated with inflammation and infection) | Colour change associated with increased blood flow to the area can range from pink to red to purple on various underlying skin colours and can be missed in darkly pigmented skin.In darkly pigmented skin, there may be a purplish hue surrounding dermal lesions. Because erythema may be missed on darkly pigmented skin, thoroughly assess/inquire about other signs and symptoms that may be indicators of inflammation/infection: pain, burning, itching, increased warmth of the skin area, swelling (appearing as smooth, shiny or tight skin), scaling, crusting, erosions and general malaise. | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library. Photo credit: Richard Usatine MD. |
| Interdigital areas, sides of fingers and toes, dorsum of hands and feet, palms, and soles | Have patients remove shoes and socks; inspect these areas carefully, as some skin cancers can occur beyond sun-exposed areas in patients with darkly pigmented skin (e.g., melanoma often on palmar, plantar, subungual areas).​[28] See Table 3 and Table 4. | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library. Photo credit: Girand/BSIP. |
| Pigmentary changes(hypo- or hyperpigmented macules or patches) | Postinflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation occurs after inflammation due to a skin disease (e.g., dermatitis, acne, psoriasis), external injury (e.g., insect bites, surgery) or irritation due to topical agents.Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation disproportionately affects patients with skin of colour and significantly affects their quality of life.​[8]​[29] | HyperpigmentationReproduced with permission from Science Photo Library. Photo credit: Dr. P. Marazzi.HypopigmentationReproduced with permission from Science Photo Library. |
| Pallor(skin appears to be a lighter colour than usual due to reduced oxyhemoglobin levels) | May present as ashen, grey or yellowish in darkly pigmented skin but often not easily visible.Identify reduced darkness in the palmar creases.Comparing the patient’s palms with those of a family member may be helpful (keeping in mind limitations in sensitivity and specificity). | Reproduced with permission from The Lancet. Photo credit: Jane Crawley. |
| Cyanosis(discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to high levels of deoxygenated hemoglobin) | Look for cyanosis where the epidermis is thin, the vascular supply is abundant or there is the least amount of pigment: oral mucous membranes (buccal, sublingual), lips, palms, soles, nail beds.Patients with darkly pigmented skin: bluish tint to palms or conjunctiva; greyish-white colour around tongue or lips; maroon tinge to nail beds.​[30]Patients with naturally yellow-toned skin: general greyish-green appearance to skin.​[31] | Reproduced with permission from Skin Deep: A DFTB Project. |
| Hair/Scalp |  |  |
| Hair breakage, decreased hair density, hair that is not lengthening, and focal/localized hair loss | Knowledge of routine hair practices related to culture or hair type and the possible complications associated with them is important (see Table 1). Be aware of hair-related conditions that may be more common in tightly coiled hair types (e.g., central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, traction alopecia). See Table 3.The presence of weaves, braids or wig caps may impede evaluation. Additionally, clinicians must be aware that it may not be feasible to conduct a physical assessment of the scalp or hair based on the patient’s personal, cultural or religious beliefs. A verbal history can still be obtained in these situations. | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org; 2024. |
| Nails |  |  |
| Discoloration of the nail plate | Longitudinal melanonychia (brown or black bands or streaks along the length of the nail plate) is a benign cause of nail discoloration in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Incidence reportedly varies from 1% in the White population to 10–20% in Japanese and Asian populations to 77–100% in the Black population. It is more common on fingernails than toenails and generally involves multiple digits.​[32]Subungual melanoma affects the nail apparatus and can be missed due to a mistaken diagnosis of melanonychia. Subungual melanoma favours a single digit, most likely the thumb of an adult, whereas benign melanonychia generally involves multiple nails. Signs suggestive of the diagnosis include irregular pigmentation, broad pigment band (at least 3 mm), a tapered band with a wider base at the origin of the nail plate, blurry and fuzzy borders, and variegated colour. Refer immediately for diagnosis.​[33]See Table 3. | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org; 2024. |


#### Dermatological Conditions Affecting Skin of Colour More Frequently or More Severely

Table 3 presents several skin conditions that affect people with darkly pigmented skin more frequently or more severely than people with lightly pigmented skin. These conditions can have significant impact on mental health and quality of life, yet they are often underdiagnosed or undertreated in patients with skin of colour.​[^[34]]

#### Special Considerations for Skin of Colour in the Management of Common Dermatological Conditions

In addition to having a working knowledge of conditions that are more frequent or more severe (see Table 3), health-care providers must also be aware of differences in presentation and treatment of common dermatological conditions in skin of colour. Timely recognition, diagnosis and treatment is vital to improve quality of life and prevent progression to more severe disease in many cases.​[^[67]] See Table 4.

| Condition | Differences in Presentation | Special Considerations for Management in SOC | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acne​[27]​[68]​[69] | Erythema may not be readily visible or may appear as a grey or purplish hue.Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a commonly associated feature or sequela of acne.In moderate to severe cases, acne can induce the development of keloids or hypertrophic scars. | Management of acne:Consider and address the role hair-care practices, such as the use of potentially comedogenic products for managing tightly coiled or chemically/thermally treated hair, play in the development of acne (e.g., pomade acne)​[68]Consider and address the role topical corticosteroids used for skin lightening may play Strategies for improving outcomes in patients with skin of colour include early initiation of therapy and careful consideration of tolerability of active ingredients and vehicle formulations Topical retinoids are particularly beneficial for patients with skin of colour, as they treat the acne lesions and help ameliorate postinflammatory hyperpigmentationSee AcnePrevention and management of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, hypertrophic scarring and keloids: Advise the use of adjunctive skin care to minimize irritation and drynessInitiate treatment early in disease course to limit development of inflammationCarefully consider tolerability of active ingredients and vehicle formulations, then titrate application to avoid irritationManagement of hyperpigmentation: hydroquinone alone in lower concentrations or, more commonly, in combination with a topical retinoid and topical corticosteroid, chemical peels, laser therapy.Management of hypertrophic scarring, keloids: compression garments, intralesional corticosteroids with or without fluorouracil, surgical excision (see Keloids, Table 3). | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org; 2024. |
| Atopic dermatitis​[12]​[27] | Erythema may be difficult to discern or may present as violaceous or hyper/hypopigmentation.May present with a more distinct papular morphology.Micropapular lichenoid or psoriasis-like coin-shaped lesions occur frequently in children of African descent.Japanese and Korean patients may have a more psoriasis-like appearance: clearly demarcated lesions with increased scaling.​[70]Lichenification (skin thickening with exaggerated skin lines) is more common in SOC than in lightly pigmented skin.More extensor or truncal involvement.More likely to develop hypo- or hyperpigmentation after the inflammation has resolved. | Management: no differences based on skin colour (see Atopic Dermatitis).Studies have demonstrated that Black patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis are less likely to receive indicated prescription medications, delaying treatment and increasing disease progression.​[19] | Reproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org; 2024.Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library. Photo credit: Richard Usatine MD. |
| Psoriasis​[12]​[19]​[71]​[72] | Tends to present with thicker plaques, more scaling and greater BSA involvement.Inflammation in SOC presents as violaceous or hyperpigmented and is less conspicuous than in lightly pigmented skin. No anatomical differences in the location of psoriasis, but potential increased BSA involved at presentation. | Management: no differences based on skin colour (see Psoriasis).Less common in darkly pigmented skin; however, the disease burden, including severity and impact on quality of life, is greater. Underdiagnosed and undertreated in darkly pigmented skin.Black and Brown skin is at highest risk of dyspigmentation.Consider risk of hyperpigmentation with phototherapy. Be aware of other conditions that may mimic psoriasis, e.g., lichen planus (especially hypertrophic type), cutaneous lupus. | Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library.

| Skin cancer ​[12]​[17]​[39]​[40]​[41]​[73] | Basal cell carcinoma:Lesions may appear as pearly, translucent, telangiectatic, ulcerated or crusting nodules. In darkly pigmented skin, the lesions are often pigmented and the pearly appearance or telangiectasia may be difficult to detectSquamous cell carcinoma:Usually occurs on non-sun-exposed sites in SOCLesion may present as a solitary, erythematous nodule or plaque that will often scale, crust or bleedMelanoma (other than acral lentiginous):The most common type of melanoma in people with darkly pigmented skin is acral lentiginous melanoma; see Table 3Non-acral lentiginous melanoma: flat brown or black spot (commonly in a mole or other dark spot) with irregular edges—may be difficult to see on darkly pigmented skin | Management: no difference based on skin colour.Skin cancer is much less common in SOC than in lightly pigmented skin, but associated morbidity and mortality are often greater due to delays in detection and diagnosis at a later stage of the disease. | Basal Cell CarcinomaReproduced with permission from ©DermNet www.dermnetnz.org; 2024.Reproduced with permission from Science Photo Library.
