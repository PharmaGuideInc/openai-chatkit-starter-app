#### Introduction

Treatment of alcohol-related disorders requires a biopsychosocial approach. Alcohol-related disorders are common and have a significant impact on health, productivity and social problems such as domestic violence, impaired driving and crime. This chapter focuses on at-risk drinking as well as 2 components of alcohol-related disorders: alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal (see Table 1 for diagnostic criteria). Other alcohol-related disorders, such as alcohol intoxication, other alcohol-induced disorders and unspecified alcohol-related disorder, will not be discussed.



Complications of alcohol use disorder may include:​[^[3]] 



#### Goals of Therapy



| Alcohol-Related Disorder | Diagnostic Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol Use DisorderSpecify current severity:Mild: Presence of 2–3 symptomsModerate: Presence of 4−5 symptomsSevere: Presence of 6 or more symptoms | A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least 2 of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol or recover from its effects.Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home.Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effectA markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcoholWithdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal)Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms |
| Alcohol Withdrawal | Cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged.Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A:Autonomic hyperactivity, e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100 bpmIncreased hand tremorInsomniaNausea or vomitingTransient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusionsPsychomotor agitationAnxietyGeneralized tonic-clonic seizuresThe signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.The signs and symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. |

#### Investigations

More information on the assessment of patients with alcohol-related disorders can be found in Figure 1.



#### Therapeutic Choices

The best practice for the treatment of alcohol use disorder is the integration of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. It is also important to recognize that substance use disorders are relapsing-remitting conditions. Communicate to patients that relapse is a normal part of this disorder and that the practitioner is available to help them if this should occur. For more information on the management of patients with alcohol use disorder, see Figure 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



| Stage of Change​[7]​[8] | Motivational Interviewing Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Precontemplation | Encourage patients to openly discuss their alcohol use.Discuss health consequences of heavy alcohol use, but avoid confrontational or judgmental comments or body language. |
| Contemplation | Encourage patients to list pros/cons of alcohol use; create a “decisional balance” weighing out the items on each side.Be understanding if the patient expresses ambivalence, and be encouraging. Provide positive reinforcement of any “change talk.” |
| Preparation | Work on practical elements of planning the quit/reduction attempt. Discuss treatment options including psychosocial treatment, need for withdrawal management and anticraving medications. Address any concerns and provide information on options. |
| Action | Monitor progress. Provide positive reinforcement for any successes. Troubleshoot any difficulties encountered. |
| Maintenance | Continue to provide positive reinforcement of successes. Work on relapse-prevention skills and self-management techniques. Build a community-based support network to sustain motivation to maintain success. |
| Relapse | Normalize relapse as a part of any change process and particularly as part of the disease of addiction.Frame relapse as a learning opportunity and not as a failure. Excessive guilt can lead to shame, which may worsen the relapse.Reassess current stage of change; use motivational approaches to help move patient back into preparation/action phase. |


#### Pharmacologic Choices

Medications used in the management of alcohol withdrawal are listed in Table 3; those used for alcohol use disorder are listed in Table 4. 

General principles:



#### Thiamine Deficiency

Heavy alcohol consumption can lead to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency through poor dietary intake and interference with vitamin absorption. Thiamine deficiency puts patients at risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, which can be fatal. Thiamine replacement is recommended for all patients who consume significant amounts of alcohol. Given the poor quality of studies of this treatment, expert consensus recommends a dose of 200 mg per day.​[^[17]]

#### Alcohol Withdrawal

Approximately two-thirds of patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be managed with supportive measures and monitoring.​[^[18]] Pharmacologic treatment is always required for moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal and may be required for about one-third of patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Most cases respond well to benzodiazepines, as they reduce the hyperactivity of GABA that occurs during withdrawal. A benzodiazepine protocol, with dosing based on the patient’s CIWA-Ar score, can be used in the primary care setting to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.​[^[19]] For more information on how to prepare the patient for office-based withdrawal, see the Primary Care Addiction Toolkit. Patients should be counselled on the risk of respiratory depression if alcohol relapse occurs during (or shortly after) benzodiazepine treatment, due to its synergistic effect. For dosing information, see Table 3.

Larger doses of benzodiazepines and/or addition of a different GABA-inhibitory drug such as phenobarbital may be required for resistant alcohol withdrawal (<5% of cases); such patients will require monitoring in a critical care area.​[^[15]]​[^[16]]

#### Alcohol Use Disorder

Evidence supports the use of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorders.​[^[19]]​[^[20]]



Preliminary studies have investigated the concurrent use of naltrexone and acamprosate, but further research is required.​[^[24]]



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), alcohol-related birth defects and spontaneous abortion.

Alcohol withdrawal carries a risk to both mother and baby, and should take place in a medically supervised in-patient setting. The CIWA-Ar scale is utilized, and benzodiazepine loading protocols are similar to those used for the nonpregnant population.

 There are no studies investigating the pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.​[^[28]] The safety of acamprosate, disulfiram and naltrexone in pregnancy has not been established and thus prescribers must carefully weigh the risks of using such medications against the risk of continued alcohol use.​[^[19]]

With respect to breastfeeding, disulfiram is contraindicated.​[^[19]] Although naltrexone appears to be minimally transferred into breast milk,​[^[29]] limited data exist regarding the safety of both acamprosate or naltrexone in the breastfeeding mother and thus prescribers must assess the benefits versus the risks of treatment.​[^[19]]​[^[30]]

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

#### Choices for Older Persons

Older patients are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol due to a variety of factors including lower levels of the enzymes that metabolize alcohol, lower total body water and concurrent medical conditions. Elderly patients tend to have more severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may experience medical complications of alcohol use more frequently than younger patients. In withdrawal management, avoid diazepam, which is renally excreted and may result in accumulation of both diazepam and its active metabolites. Lorazepam is the preferred choice for withdrawal management in this population. Elderly patients may benefit from relapse-prevention medications; carefully consider the increased potential for adverse reactions and drug interactions in this population.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for assessing and managing alcohol use. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initiate Discussion**: 
   - Begin by discussing alcohol use with the patient.

2. **Administer the One-Question Screen**:
   - Ask: “How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day?”
     - X = 5 for men and 4 for women.
   - If the answer is ≥1, administer the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test).

3. **Identify Severity of Alcohol Use**:
   - Refer to Table 1 to classify as:
     - At-risk drinker
     - Alcohol use disorder (mild, moderate, severe)

4. **Path for At-Risk Drinker**:
   - Provide psychoeducation and trial of reduced drinking in accordance with Canada’s Guidance on Alcohol and Health.

5. **Path for Alcohol Use Disorder**:
   - Assess motivation to change by identifying the stage (refer to Table 2):
     - Precontemplation
     - Contemplation
     - Preparation
     - Action
     - Maintenance
     - Relapse

6. **Inquire About Previous Change Attempts**:
   - Questions to ask:
     - What have they tried?
     - Were they successful?
     - If yes, for how long did they continue to meet their goal?
     - What helped past attempts succeed?

7. **Determine Patient Goal**:
   - Decide between reduction or abstinence.

8. **Reduction Path**:
   - Provide psychosocial treatment (refer to Nonpharmacologic Choices) plus naltrexone.

9. **Abstinence Path**:
   - Assess risk of alcohol withdrawal using PAWSS and CIWA-Ar tools.
   - If withdrawal is present, treat it (refer to Table 3).
   - Provide psychosocial treatment (refer to Nonpharmacologic Choices) plus acamprosate.

This flowchart guides healthcare providers through the process of assessing alcohol use severity, determining motivation and goals, and selecting appropriate interventions.
