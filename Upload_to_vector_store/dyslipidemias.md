CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women,” “men,” “female” and “male” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients.

#### Introduction

Dyslipidemias are abnormalities in the quantity or function of lipids or lipoproteins in the blood. The majority of dyslipidemias result from interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Understanding the contribution of each factor in the dyslipidemic patient is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nevertheless, it is essential to rule out secondary causes of dyslipidemia that, when identified and potentially eliminated, can prevent unnecessary treatment. In addition, the use of lipid-lowering agents in the management of cardiovascular (CV) disease has become part of routine preventive care.

Screening of the lipid profile is recommended in children with a family history of dyslipidemia or CV disease, men ≥40 years of age and women ≥40 years of age or postmenopausal (see Criteria for Intervention). At-risk individuals, such as those who are South Asian, First Nations or recent immigrants, may be screened at an earlier age.​[^[1]] Current CV risk calculators have not been validated in these patients.​[^[2]] While patients who are South Asian,​[^[3]] First Nations​[^[4]] and new immigrants are considered at-risk for CV disease, the risk should not be attributed solely to biological or genetic factors. Rather, structural inequalities are known to limit racialized patients’ access to social determinants of health and contribute to disease risk.

Screen all patients with the risk factors in Table 1 irrespective of age.​[^[1]]

Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥95​[^th] percentile for age and sex or ≥5 mmol/L in adults), severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) (triglycerides [TG] ≥10 mmol/L), or a history of HTG-induced acute pancreatitis should be referred to a specialized lipid clinic or a genetic dyslipidemias clinic in order to receive proper diagnosis and follow-up. 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

Clinical evaluation should focus on:



| Condition | Medication​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| Alcohol excess (>1–2 drinks/day)Chronic renal failureDiabetes/metabolic syndromeHypothyroidismNephrotic syndromeObstructive liver diseaseOverweight/obesityPregnancy | Beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic or alpha-blocking activityCorticosteroidsHighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)Oral contraceptivesThiazide diuretics |


#### Criteria for Intervention

In its 2021 guidelines, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society introduced the concept of using treatment thresholds for lipid-lowering therapy intensification rather than the treat-to-target approach. It is recommended that patients with high cardiovascular risk be considered to have a statin-indicated condition (see Table 3). Other patients should be stratified into 1 of 3 categories of CV risk using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). It is recommended to double the FRS when there is a family history of premature CV disease. This is referred to as the modified FRS (see Figure 1). Based on the risk score, thresholds to initiate and intensify treatment are shown in Figure 2.​[^[1]] Reassess the cardiovascular risk using the modified FRS every 5 years for patients who are 40–75 years of age.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) screening using computed tomography may be considered for asymptomatic adults ≥40 years of age with an intermediate FRS and for whom treatment decisions are uncertain (see Figure 2).​[^[1]] Consider referring these individuals for specialist assessment.

High triglyceride levels (2.3–11.3 mmol/L) are an additional CV risk factor when associated with atherogenic dyslipidemias, e.g., familial combined hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, chronic kidney disease. Very high triglyceride levels (>10 mmol/L) are a risk factor for pancreatitis.

| Condition | Description |

| Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary disease by angiography (>10% stenosis), stroke, TIA, documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, claudication and/or ABI <0.9, abdominal aortic aneurysm (abdominal aorta >3 cm or previous aneurysm surgery) |
| Chronic kidney disease | >3 months duration and ACR >3 mg/mmoL or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m​2 and ≥50 years of age |
| Diabetes mellitus | ≥40 years of age or >15 years’ duration and ≥30 years of age or microvascular complications |

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 5 summarizes the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on lipoproteins. Statins are recommended as first-line lipid-lowering agents for cardiovascular event prevention.​[^[1]] Other agents from different classes may be substituted if statins are not tolerated or added if threshold lipid targets are exceeded. However, cardiovascular outcomes are not clearly improved with all nonstatin agents. Some combination therapies (such as fibrates and statins) carry an increased risk of drug toxicity, particularly with long-term use, so consider referral of such patients to a specialized lipid clinic.​[^[9]] 

| Lipid-Lowering Agent | LDL-C | HDL-C | Triglycerides |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) | ↓ 20–60% | ↑ 5–15% | ↓ 7–30%​[a] |
| Ezetimibe | ↓ 14–25% | ↑ 1% | ↓ 7–9% |
| Fibrates | ↓ 5–20% | ↑ 10–35% | ↓ 20–50% |
| PCSK9 Inhibitors | ↓ 50–70% | ↑ 5–10% | ↓ 15% |
| Resins | ↓ 10–30% | ↑ 3–10% | ↑ 10–25% |


See Table 7 for prescribing information on drugs used in the management of dyslipidemias.

#### HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)

 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potent LDL-lowering agents that interfere with the atherosclerotic disease process. Effect on HDL-C is modest. Significant reductions in CVD morbidity, CVD mortality and total deaths have been associated with their use. Over 1 year, for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, the relative risk of major vascular events is reduced by 21% and the relative risk of all-cause mortality is reduced by 10%.​[^[10]] In another analysis, this relative risk reduction was lower in the first year of therapy (about 9%) and increased to 22–25% for each subsequent year of statin therapy.​[^[11]] For primary CVD prevention, statins should be initiated at the recommended starting doses to ensure they are tolerated and titrated to reach target doses. For secondary CVD prevention, the maximal dose of a high-intensity statin should be used. Statin therapy can be divided according to lipid-lowering activity: 



In secondary prevention of CVD, all patients should receive statin therapy. For primary prevention of CVD in patients at high risk of coronary artery disease, statins are also recommended.​[^[1]] Because achieving very low LDL-C levels (<1.30 mmol/L) is safe and yields additional cardiovascular benefits,​[^[12]]​[^[13]] the use of high-intensity statin is preferred, particularly in secondary prevention patients.​[^[1]] Statins may be considered in patients in lower-risk groups based on the individual’s global cardiovascular risk (see Figure 1, Figure 2).​[^[1]]​[^[14]]

Muscle-related symptoms are often reported with statins, but must be carefully assessed to rule out other causes.​[^[15]] Many factors may predispose patients to myotoxic effects (see Table 6), so close monitoring and perhaps lower doses or alternate-day dosing of statins will be required in these situations. Figure 3 provides suggestions for managing muscle-related symptoms. See Suggested Readings for references reviewing this topic. A statin intolerance calculator is available at www.circl.ubc.ca/english/web_statin.html.

Other concerns are the risk of new-onset diabetes, estimated as 1 extra case of diabetes for each 1000 patients/years of treatment,​[^[18]] and anecdotal reports of cognitive side effects (such as memory loss). Although the potential increased risk of diabetes appears to be related to high doses of statins, the benefits of statin use exceeds the risk of diabetes in high cardiovascular risk patients. In 2014, the Statin Cognitive Safety Task Force concluded, based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, that statins as a class are not associated with adverse effects on cognition.​[^[19]]

For children with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), statin therapy is recommended; the usual age for initiation is 8–10 years. The management of these patients is complex. The LDL-C threshold required to initiate statin therapy as well as the age for statin initiation require clinical judgment and should take into consideration the preferences of the patient and family.​[^[20]] Children with FH should be referred to a specialized lipid clinic.

#### Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors

Ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, is indicated as monotherapy or in combination with statins. It is better tolerated than resins, has low potential for drug interactions with cytochrome P450 substrates and does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.​[^[21]] Early clinical trials with ezetimibe did not show improvement in outcomes such as reduced subclinical atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events,​[^[22]]​[^[23]] but subsequent trials in specific scenarios have shown otherwise. In patients with chronic kidney disease, the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe significantly and safely reduced the risk of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events by 17% compared with placebo; it should be considered in this patient population.​[^[24]] In the IMPROVE-IT trial, ezetimibe in combination with simvastatin reduced the incidence of major coronary events, nonfatal stroke and death from cardiovascular causes by 6% compared to simvastatin alone in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome.​[^[25]] Therefore ezetimibe could be considered primarily in addition to statin therapy, but also as an alternative regimen if statins are not tolerated.​[^[1]]

#### Fibrates

Bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil lower triglyceride levels and raise HDL-C. The effect of fibrates on LDL-C is variable; bezafibrate and fenofibrate lower LDL-C more consistently. Except for gemfibrozil, combining a fibrate with a statin may be considered. In the FIELD trial, fenofibrate reduced nonfatal MI by 24% and coronary revascularization by 21%, but was associated with a nonsignificant increase in fatal events compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.​[^[26]] The combination of a fibrate and a statin in the type 2 diabetes population is not routinely recommended, although it could be beneficial for patients with a high baseline triglyceride level and low HDL-C.​[^[27]] In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥10 mmol/L), the risk of acute pancreatitis is very high and preventive actions are mandatory. Fibrates are recommended as the first-line pharmacological therapy in these patients.​[^[28]] Combination therapy of a statin and a fibrate is often needed in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia.​[^[28]] Referral to a specialized lipid clinic must be considered for these patients.

#### PCSK9 Inhibitors

Alirocumab and evolocumab represent a class of lipid-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. These agents are monoclonal antibodies directed against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key protein in the LDL receptor degradation pathway. They are supplied as single-dose prefilled autoinjectors, which are administered subcutaneously either every 2 weeks or once monthly. The PCSK9 inhibitors provide an additional 60% reduction in LDL-C beyond that achieved with statins alone.​[^[8]] Furthermore, both agents are associated with a 5–10% increase in HDL-C, an approximate 15% decrease in triglycerides and an approximate 25% decrease in lipoprotein(a).​[^[8]] 

The cardiovascular outcome trials (FOURIER for evolocumab and ODYSSEY Outcomes for alirocumab) showed that the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors to statins significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Indeed, evolocumab was associated with 27% relative risk reduction of myocardial infarction and 21% relative risk reduction of stroke. Both agents were associated with 15% reduced relative risk of the composite primary end point.​[^[29]]​[^[30]] There are no significant adverse reactions associated with the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, except for injection-site reactions that occur in 2–4% of patients.​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]]

The FOURIER open labelled extension study confirmed the cardiovascular benefits of evolocumab over a longer period (>8 y of follow-up) as well as the absence of adverse events, even for patients reaching very low LDL-C concentrations (median LDL-C of 0.8 mmol/L).​[^[32]]

Both alirocumab and evolucumab should be considered in very high-risk individuals (patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or in secondary cardiovascular prevention) when lipid threshold values are exceeded with maximally tolerated lipid-lowering medication.​[^[1]]

Inclisiran is another type of PCSK9 inhibitor. It is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that reduces hepatic synthesis of PCSK9. In phase III studies (ORION-10 and ORION-11), this molecule was associated with a reduction in LDL-C of approximately 50% when administered subcutaneously every 6 months.​[^[33]] The cardiovascular outcome study is currently ongoing (ORION-4).​[^[34]] Inclisiran has been approved by Health Canada, but use will be influenced by reimbursement considerations.

#### Resins

The bile acid-sequestering resins cholestyramine, colesevelam and colestipol reduce plasma LDL-C and can slightly increase HDL-C levels. They have a strong safety record. In the prestatin era, cholestyramine was shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes when used alone as demonstrated by the Lipid Research Council - Cardiovascular Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT).​[^[35]] In the modern era, no cardiovascular outcome trial combining these agents with statin therapy has been published. Increase in TG levels, GI distress and concomitant drug malabsorption are the main drawbacks to these agents, although colesevelam may be associated with a better GI tolerability. Resins are appropriate lipid-lowering agents in children and in pregnant or breastfeeding patients. They are also appropriate added to maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe in high-risk patients to help reduce LDL-C.​[^[1]]

#### ANGPTL3 Inhibitors

Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). Inhibition of ANGPTL3 promotes very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism in the liver and lowers plasma lipid levels. Evinacumab was approved by Health Canada in 2023 and is indicated as adjunctive therapy in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In the ELIPSE HoFH trial, intravenous infusion of evinacumab every 4 weeks in addition to the background lipid-lowering regimen reduced LDL-C by 49% compared to placebo.​[^[36]] Its use will be influenced by reimbursement considerations.​[^[37]]

#### Icosapent Ethyl

Icosapent ethyl consists of purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, an omega-3 fatty acid), which is derived from fish oil. Icosapent ethyl was approved in Canada to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. This approval was supported by the results of the REDUCE-IT trial, in which this treatment was associated with a significant 25% relative reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients on statin therapy with fasting TG between 1.52 and 5.63 mmol/L and LDL-C between 1.06 to 2.59 mmol/L. This cardiovascular protection was achieved with 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily taken orally (total daily dose, 4 g) over a median of 4.9 years.​[^[38]] Three types of adverse events occurred significantly more frequently in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group: peripheral edema (6.5% vs. 5.0%), atrial fibrillation (5.3% vs. 3.9%) and constipation (5.4% vs. 3.6%).​[^[38]] The EVAPORATE trial demonstrated that the addition of icosapent ethyl to statin resulted in slowed coronary plaque progression (low-attenuation, total, total noncalcified, fibrofatty and fibrous plaque volume) compared to statin plus placebo.​[^[39]]

In its 2021 guidelines, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends the use of icosapent ethyl (2 g BID) to lower the risk of CV events in secondary prevention patients (or primary prevention with diabetes and ≥1 CVD risk factors) who have a fasting TG level between 1.5 and 5.6 mmol/L despite treatment with maximally tolerated statin therapy.​[^[1]]

#### Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein Inhibitors

Lomitapide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adult homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Due to its potential for significant hepatic toxicity, regular monitoring of hepatic transaminases is recommended. Where available, referral to a specialized lipid clinic is recommended for patients who may require lomitapide therapy.

#### Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)

Niacin is a B vitamin that at high doses lowers triglycerides and LDL-C and raises HDL-C. The AIM-HIGH and HPS2–THRIVE studies failed to show a benefit in increasing HDL-C with niacin in patients already treated optimally with a statin.​[^[40]]​[^[41]] Niacin is no longer recommended in the management of dyslipidemic patients.

#### Nonprescription Agents

Daily consumption of 10 g psyllium may result in a 7% reduction in LDL-C.​[^[1]] In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, omega-3 fatty acids 2–4 g daily may reduce triglycerides by 25–30%.​[^[1]] Patients taking more than 3 g daily of omega-3 fatty acids from supplements should do so only under a physician’s care. High intakes could cause excessive bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeds. Supplementation with long chain omega-3 fatty acids is not associated with CV risk reduction.​[^[1]] The 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines recommend **plant sterols/stanols** supplementation (≥2 g/day) as a dietary component to reduce LDL-C.​[^[1]] In a small trial, a product containing 2 g phytosterols (Cardiosmile) showed that compared to placebo, 28 days of supplementation reduced LDL-C and triglycerides by 12% and 14% respectively.​[^[42]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Due to hormonal changes, plasma lipids increase throughout the duration of pregnancy; total cholesterol concentrations increase 25–50% and total triglycerides by 2- to 4-fold. By midgestation, there is a 50% increase in LDL-C and a 30% rise in HDL-C, followed at term by a slight decrease in HDL-C.​[^[43]]

Risk factors for hyperlipidemia also apply to pregnancy and include obesity, weight gain, hypothyroidism, gestational and nongestational diabetes, alcohol consumption, medications, and genetic predisposition.​[^[44]] Very severe forms of hypertriglyceridemia may increase the risk of pancreatitis.​[^[45]]

#### Prepregnancy Considerations

Risk-factor control is recommended throughout the pregnancy. The teratogenicity of lipid-lowering drugs in humans is not well established but appears to be small (if present at all) with statins, and termination of pregnancy is not warranted should fetal exposure occur. However, in order to reduce the risks as much as possible, it is recommended to discontinue statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors at least 1 month before stopping contraception. Resins can be safely maintained during pregnancy.​[^[20]]

#### Management during Pregnancy

Reassure patients that unless CV risk is very high, interrupting treatment for the duration of the childbearing period has little impact on the overall risk. Lipid-profile monitoring during pregnancy is not required, except for patients affected by familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).

#### Familial hypercholesterolemia

In the context of FH, which is associated with an extremely high cardiovascular risk, monitoring of LDL-C during pregnancy is required and resins can be safely prescribed. In FH patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or for those with homozygous FH, LDL apheresis can be considered.​[^[20]] 

#### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome

In order to avoid the risk of pancreatitis, a very low-fat diet (<10% of calories from fat) is required in these patients, even during pregnancy. Close monitoring of TG value is imperative. Direct removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by plasmapheresis or plasma exchange can be considered in pregnant FCS patients, although the benefits are not well documented (mainly as case reports).​[^[46]]​[^[47]]

#### Management during Postpartum/Breastfeeding

Treatment may be resumed unless breastfeeding is considered. Lipid-lowering drugs are currently not recommended during breastfeeding due to the lack of safety data.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

The image is a medical flowchart for determining statin therapy based on cardiovascular risk assessment. Here's a detailed description:

### Initial Assessment
1. **Statin-Indicated Condition?**
   - If "No," the process ends.
   - If "Yes," proceed to calculate the Framingham Risk Score (FRS).

### Framingham Risk Score (FRS) Calculation
- **Low Risk (10-year risk: FRS <10%)**
  - Criteria: FRS 5–9% plus LDL-C ≥3.5 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥4.2 mmol/L or ApoB ≥1.05 g/L) plus other risk modifiers.
  - Action: Nonpharmacologic choices and statin therapy.

- **Intermediate Risk (10-year risk: FRS 10–19%)**
  - Criteria: 
    - LDL-C ≥3.5 mmol/L (or ApoB ≥1.05 g/L or non-HDL-C ≥4.2 mmol/L)
    - Men ≥50 years and women ≥60 years plus one additional risk factor
    - Presence of other risk modifiers.
  - If "Yes," consider nonpharmacologic choices and statin therapy.
  - If "No," consider nonpharmacologic choices only.

- **High Risk (10-year risk: FRS ≥20%)**
  - Action: Nonpharmacologic choices and statin therapy.
  - Further assessment:
    - **LDL-C ≥5 mmol/L**: Consider add-on therapy.
    - **High-risk primary prevention, DM, or CKD**: Consider add-on therapy.
    - **ASCVD**: Consider add-on therapy.

### Add-On Therapy Considerations
- **Consider add-on therapy if:**
  - **LDL-C ≥2.5 mmol/L**
  - <50% LDL-C reduction or non-HDL-C ≥3.2 mmol/L or ApoB ≥0.85 g/L
  - **LDL-C ≥2 mmol/L** or non-HDL-C ≥2.6 mmol/L or ApoB ≥0.80 g/L
  - **LDL-C ≥1.8 mmol/L** or non-HDL-C ≥2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥0.70 g/L

### Notes

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to guide the management of patients with muscle-related symptoms, particularly in the context of statin use. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - **Patient with muscle-related symptoms**
     - Conduct a **History** and **Physical examination**
     - **Check creatine kinase** levels

2. **Decision Points:**
   - **Normal creatine kinase:**
     - Diagnosis: **Myalgia**
     - Action: Consider risks vs. benefits of statin. Options include continuing, reducing dose, stopping statin, or using an alternate statin.

   - **Creatine kinase < 10 times upper limit of normal:**
     - Diagnosis: **Myositis**
     - Action: **Stop statin**
     - Monitor creatine kinase until it returns to normal range.
     - Consider predisposing factors and treat if possible.
     - Consider repeating statin challenge with a lower dose or alternate statin.
     - Consider nonstatin drugs as adjunct or replacement.

   - **Creatine kinase > 10 times upper limit of normal:**
     - Action: **Stop statin**
     - Check renal function and urine myoglobin.
     - If diagnosed, treat **rhabdomyolysis**.

3. **Additional Considerations:**
   - For myalgia, weigh the risks and benefits of continuing statin therapy.
   - For myositis, ensure creatine kinase levels are monitored and consider alternative treatments if necessary.
   - For rhabdomyolysis, prioritize treatment and renal function assessment.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing muscle-related symptoms in patients, particularly focusing on the implications of creatine kinase levels and the use of statins.
