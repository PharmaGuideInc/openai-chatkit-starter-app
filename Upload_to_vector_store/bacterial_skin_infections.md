#### Introduction

This chapter addresses the following bacterial skin infections:

#### Superficial skin infections:

 **Folliculitis:** Inflammation of superficial or deep hair follicles, producing papules and pustules. Infectious causes include Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (hot tub–associated) and other gram-negative rods. Noninfectious causes may be termed “pseudofolliculitis” and are induced by friction and/or occlusion (e.g., hair removal). A **furuncle (boil)** is an S. aureus–mediated infection of the hair follicle with extension of suppurative material into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Interconnecting multiple furuncles that coalesce into a single purulent mass are termed a **carbuncle**.​[^[1]]

 **Impetigo:** Superficial infection of skin primarily caused by S. aureus (more common) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus), which most often affects young children. Primary impetigo refers to infection of previously healthy skin, while secondary impetigo (also known as **impetiginization**) affects nonintact skin (e.g., abrasions, eczema). Two clinical forms of impetigo include **nonbullous** (S. aureus and/or S. pyogenes), characterized by papules, vesicles and pustules that break down to an adherent “honey-crust” appearance on the face or extremities; and **bullous** (S. aureus-mediated toxin), which presents as fluid-filled vesicles that can evolve into flaccid bullae that rupture to form a thin, brown crust on the trunk. **Ecthyma** is a deeper form of nonbullous impetigo that extends into the dermis, resulting in ulceration and crusting, and is more commonly associated with S. pyogenes than S. aureus.​[^[2]]

#### Skin and soft tissue structure infections:

 **Cellulitis:** Acute infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue characterized by poorly circumscribed bright-red erythema, edema, warmth and tenderness. Cellulitis can be categorized into **nonpurulent** (caused predominantly by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or **purulent** (S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] strains). Other less common pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae with buccal (facial) cellulitis (particularly in children not immunized with H. influenzae B (Hib) vaccine), Pasteurella and Capnocytophaga (oral organisms) with animal bites, and Aeromonas and Vibrio with environmental water exposures.​[^[3]]

 **Erysipelas:** Acute infection of the upper dermis and lymphatics, occurring most commonly on the face and lower extremities. It is often caused by S. pyogenes; less frequently by S. aureus. Erysipelas is distinguished from cellulitis by more superficial cutaneous and prominent lymphatic involvement, with more sharply delineated, raised margins and dimples around the follicles, described as “*peau d’orange*” (orange peel texture).​[^[1]] Recurrence occurs in up to 30% of cases.​[^[4]]

**Human and animal (dog and cat) bites:** Bite wounds may often lead to superficial soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis with or without abscess. Human bites are associated with human oral flora (e.g., Eikenella, S. pyogenes, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Prevotella), while cat and dog bites are associated with Pasteurella and Capnocytophaga.​[^[5]] Deeper infections, including septic arthritis, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis and necrotizing infection, should be referred to an infectious diseases physician.

**Cutaneous abscess:** Infection of the dermal or subcutaneous tissues in which a collection of pus is formed without follicular involvement. The most common cause is S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] or -resistant [MRSA] strains); however, polymicrobial infections may also occur.​[^[5]]

 **Necrotizing fasciitis:**

Considerations prior to systemic treatment:



#### Systemic Agents

Information on systemic agents used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections can also be found in Table 1.

Note that for invasive or life-threatening infections and those not responding to treatment, cultures and clinical evaluation must be used to guide specific pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy.

#### Beta-lactams



#### Penicillin allergy

Penicillin allergy is reported in 10% of the population, however less than 1% are truly allergic.​[^[19]] Cross-reactivity with cephalosporins is based on similarities in the side-chain between antibiotics, not the beta-lactam ring structure. Patients with minor delayed reactions (e.g., rash without hives) have low risk of experiencing adverse events with cephalosporins (approximately 1%).​[^[20]]​[^[21]] Patients with type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, hives) may receive cephalosporins that do not share side-chains with the offending beta-lactam antibiotic,​[^[22]] with close monitoring of the first dose. Patients describing severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to any beta-lactam antibiotic should not receive any class of beta-lactam antibiotics due to potential life-threatening reactions.

#### Lincosamides



#### Oxazolidinones



#### Sulfonamides

Sulfamethoxazole/​trimethoprim should be considered when MRSA skin infection is suspected or documented; however, this drug does not cover streptococci effectively. Additional coverage should be considered if streptococci are suspected.

#### Tetracyclines

**Tetracyclines** (e.g., doxycycline) cover both streptococci and staphylococci, including MRSA. These drugs are less studied, but appear to be effective for minor infections when used in conjunction with abscess drainage and other interventions.

#### Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolones use should be limited when treating common bacterial skin infections, unless gram-negative organisms are suspected. Ciprofloxacin can be used to treat *Pseudomonas* or hot tub folliculitis in select patients with extensive or symptomatic involvement, or in those who are severely immunocompromised; however, the condition is often self-limiting in untreated patients.

#### Topical Agents

Topical agents should not be used to treat an infection that exceeds the immediate area surrounding a wound or lesion. Topical agents may have a role in preventing infection; however, good wound care is probably as effective and less likely to induce toxicity or resistance. If used, topical agents should be used sparingly and for a limited period of time.

Information on topical agents used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections can be found in Table 2.

Mupirocin is an effective topical antibiotic for localized treatment of impetigo and folliculitis caused by S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Applied intranasally, it can be used to eradicate S. aureus nasal carriage as part of a decolonization protocol (see Figure 2).​[^[24]] Resistance rates to mupirocin in MRSA have been increasing and are linked with prior exposure to the drug.​[^[24]]

Fusidic acid is another topical antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Due to reports of increasing resistance of S. aureus to fusidic acid, the drug should be used only for a defined treatment course and not for reducing the colonization of wounds at risk for infection.​[^[25]]

Ozenoxacin is a topical nonfluorinated quinolone with activity against S. aureus (including MRSA) and S. pyogenes.​[^[26]] It is indicated only for the treatment of impetigo. There are no studies comparing effectiveness of ozenoxacin to that of other topical antibiotics used in Canada to treat localized impetigo.

Numerous nonprescription proprietary preparations containing antibiotics with both gram-positive and -negative coverage are available (e.g., **bacitracin**, **gramicidin**, **polymyxin B**). These agents have limited clinical studies for bacterial skin infections.​[^[24]] Bacitracin use has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis.​[^[27]] 

**Silver sulfadiazine** was previously believed to play a role in reducing microbes in wounds and burns; however, there are some reports that suggest a risk of delayed wound healing associated with silver sulfadiazine such that alternative wound regimens should be considered when feasible.​[^[28]] 

#### Prevention

Infection-control practices are important in preventing the spread of confirmed S. aureus or MRSA skin infections in either the patient or to a family member. General measures, such as covering of any exposed wounds or lesions, not sharing personal items, avoiding contact with bandages or wounds of infected individuals, and regular handwashing can help to reduce the risk of transmission.

Prophylaxis using low-dose beta-lactams for cellulitis is controversial. If considered, it should be used only for those with numerous recurrences, since the protective effect is diminished with discontinuation of prophylaxis.​[^[29]]​[^[30]]

Patients with invasive group A streptococcal infections (e.g., associated with bacteremia or necrotizing fasciitis) must be reported to Public Health. Prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated in close contacts.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Skin Infections and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Indications and treatment principles for bacterial skin infections in pregnancy are similar to those for nonpregnant patients, with avoidance of oral or IV antimicrobials known to have teratogenic risk. Pregnancy may exacerbate frictional folliculitis due to weight gain.

#### Pre-pregnancy Considerations

Patients considering conception should discontinue potentially teratogenic antibiotics (e.g., sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline) unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Advise patients with recurrent folliculitis of unknown origin to obtain bacterial swabs to rule out community-acquired MRSA, as its presence would require appropriate counselling for management during pregnancy. Ensure preventative strategies are optimized for patients with underlying skin disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis) who are prone to secondary skin infections.

#### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

Beta-lactams are generally considered safe in pregnancy and are first-line for most skin and soft tissue infections.

For confirmed bacterial infections requiring systemic antibacterial agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin and erythromycin (with the exception of the estolate salt) can all be used safely during pregnancy.​[^[31]]​[^[32]] **Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim** should be avoided in the first trimester due to risks of neural tube defects and avoided in the last month due to risk of kernicterus after delivery.​[^[33]]

There is limited data available on safety of topical antibiotics in pregnancy. Mupirocin is not expected to pose any risk to the fetus based on animal data and its limited absorption with topical use.​[^[33]]​[^[34]] The manufacturer states that there is some evidence that systemic (not topical) fusidic acid crosses the placental barrier,​[^[35]] but no reports of teratogenicity have been found. Topical ozenoxacin has not been studied in pregnant patients, but systemic absorption is negligible.​[^[36]]

#### Management during Breastfeeding

If a breastfeeding patient requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for a cutaneous infection, penicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin and erythromycin may be used safely, but may alter the bowel flora of the infant and rarely cause a hypersensitivity reaction.​[^[32]] Small cuts and abrasions on the nipple are common with breastfeeding and may lead to mastitis usually due to S. aureus; continued breastfeeding, warm compresses and careful massage may help to reduce pain and abscess development. Oral or IV antibiotics should be reserved for when conservative measures fail.

Topical mupirocin may be used safely during breastfeeding, since limited amounts are absorbed.​[^[37]]​[^[38]] No information on safety of topical use of fusidic acid by a breastfeeding patient is available. The safety of topical ozenoxacin has not been studied in breastfeeding patients; however, it is not expected to be transferred into breast milk, as systemic absorption is negligible.​[^[36]] As a general precaution, direct skin-to-skin contact of the breastfeeding infant with the patient’s treated skin area should be avoided with topical use of any medication.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart detailing the management of bacterial folliculitis. Here's a structured description:

### Overview
- **Condition**: Bacterial folliculitis
  - **Characteristics**: Follicular pustules with surrounding erythema, favoring hair-bearing areas and areas subject to occlusion.
  - **Predominant organism**: *Staphylococcus aureus*

### Management Pathways

#### Localized Folliculitis
1. **Initial Considerations**:
   - Determine the role of mechanical factors (e.g., friction, shaving, tight-fitting clothing, occlusion) when deciding if bacterial therapy is warranted.
2. **Treatment Steps**:
   - Use hot compresses and topical antiseptics or drying agents to treat occlusion or friction.
   - If no improvement after 7 days, proceed to:
     - **Topical antibacterial treatment**: Options include mupirocin, fusidic acid, or clindamycin solution.

#### Extensive or Refractory Folliculitis
1. **Initial Action**:
   - Swab exudate from pustule for culture and sensitivity (C&S).
2. **Oral Antibacterial Treatment**:
   - **First-line**: Cephalexin for 7 days.
   - **Second-line**: Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, doxycycline, clindamycin, or oxacillin for 7 days.
   - If MRSA is suspected, use sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or doxycycline for 7 days.
3. **Follow-up**:
   - If no improvement after 48 hours, modify therapy based on C&S results.

### Decision Points
- **Localized**: Evaluate mechanical factors and use topical treatments.
- **Extensive/Refractory**: Use oral antibiotics and adjust based on C&S if needed.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to treating bacterial folliculitis, emphasizing the importance of evaluating mechanical factors and using appropriate antibacterial therapies.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for the treatment of impetigo, detailing the decision-making process for managing the condition. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - In conjunction with treating impetigo, assess and treat any underlying skin barrier disruption (e.g., insect bite, abrasion, or atopic or contact dermatitis) if present.

2. **Nonpharmacologic Choices:**
   - Implement nonpharmacologic choices: apply compresses (for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily) and remove crusts.

3. **Swab for Culture:**
   - Swab exudate below crust for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity (C&S) to later modify treatment according to culture results if empiric therapy is not effective.

4. **Classification of Impetigo:**
   - **Non-bullous form:**
     - Characterized by superficial erosions with honey-colored and/or hemorrhagic crusting.
     - Usual pathogen: *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A Streptococcus).

   - **Bullous form:**
     - Characterized by flaccid vesicles and bullae that rupture easily, leaving erosion and peripheral collarette of scale with brown crusting.
     - Usual pathogen: *Staphylococcus aureus*.

5. **Non-bullous Form Treatment:**
   - Determine if there is a localized infection in an otherwise healthy patient.
     - **Yes:** Use topical antibacterial (e.g., fusidic acid or mupirocin) for 5 days.
     - **No:** Assess for indicators of a more complex case:
       - Extensive crusting.
       - Immunodeficiency.
       - Deeper level of skin involved with ulcers appearing under crusted areas (possible ecthyma).
     - If any indicators are present, proceed to oral antibacterial treatment.

6. **Bullous Form Treatment:**
   - Determine if the condition is mild, localized or moderate-to-severe, or disseminated.
     - **Mild, localized:** Follow similar treatment as non-bullous form.
     - **Moderate-to-severe or disseminated:** Use oral antibacterial (e.g., cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, or cloxacillin) for 7 days.

7. **Reassessment:**
   - If no improvement after 48 hours, modify treatment according to culture results.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and treating impetigo, considering both non-bullous and bullous forms, and includes steps for reassessment and modification based on culture results.
