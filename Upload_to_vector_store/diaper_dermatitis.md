#### Introduction

Diaper dermatitis is an area-specific form of contact dermatitis that can be further classified as irritant or allergic. Most patients experience irritant diaper dermatitis (primarily due to contact with urine and feces trapped in the diaper area), while allergic diaper dermatitis (due to patient-specific allergic reactions to products used in the diaper area) is less common, particularly in the first year of life. The terms *incontinence-associated dermatitis* (IAD) and *perineal dermatitis* have gained popularity for describing this condition in older patients, while terms like *diaper rash*, *nappy rash* and *napkin dermatitis* continue to be used for younger patients.​[^[1]] Reported prevalence of diaper dermatitis (DD) varies greatly, but it is considered the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy.​[^[2]] It can present as early as 7 days after birth, with a peak incidence around 9–12 months of age.​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Dermatitic skin is at an increased risk of infection by microbes including Candida, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, complicating the approach to treatment. DD can cause significant patient discomfort and increase caregiver burden.​[^[5]] While attempts at management may lead to frustration, DD rarely causes problems for prolonged periods of time.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Persistent DD may be associated with food allergy​[^[7]] or be a manifestation of underlying disease such as Kawasaki disease, granuloma gluteale infantum or cytomegalovirus.​[^[8]]​[^[9]]

This chapter focuses on irritant diaper dermatitis in infants; however, many of the strategies presented can be generalized to other patient populations. Note: there is little evidence on the effectiveness of specific interventions for IAD, and data is often derived from patients in nursing homes or hospitals and not from home or community settings. High-quality trials in different care settings are needed to consolidate recommendations for IAD.

#### Pathophysiology

Diaper dermatitis is the cumulative result of several features of the diaper environment that predispose the skin to damage and reflects progressive barrier compromise. This impaired barrier function increases the risk of infection and sensitivity to irritants, further perpetuating skin damage.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] The multifactorial pathogenesis of DD is described in Figure 1. Factors increasing surface pH in the diaper region, namely the constituents of urine and feces, are considered the most important elements for the development of DD. Untreated or infected DD can progress to skin ulceration, infection of the penis or vulva, and urinary tract infections.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a flowchart illustrating the causes and effects leading to diaper dermatitis. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Factors:**
   - **Urine:** Urea is converted to ammonia by urease produced by fecal bacteria.
   - **Feces:** Increased pH activates fecal enzymes (protease and lipase).
   - **Diapers, plastic pants, etc.:** Create an occlusive environment.

2. **Consequences of Initial Factors:**
   - Leads to:
     - Increased pH (alkalinity)
     - Increased moisture and overhydration

3. **Further Effects:**
   - **Altered cutaneous microbiome**
   - **Risk of infection:** Examples include Candida, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus.

4. **Physical and Chemical Irritation:**
   - **Physical Irritation:** Caused by frequent cleansing and mechanical friction (skin-to-diaper, skin-to-skin).
   - **Chemical Irritation:** Caused by frequent cleansing with harsh soaps/detergents.

5. **Effects of Irritation:**
   - Leads to:
     - Skin maceration and disruption of the stratum corneum
     - Increased skin permeability and decreased skin barrier function

6. **Outcome:**
   - All these factors increase susceptibility to diaper dermatitis.

The flowchart effectively outlines how various factors contribute to the development of diaper dermatitis through a series of interconnected processes.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

A comprehensive patient assessment is essential to identifying risk factors and determining the cause of skin injury. This involves obtaining a detailed medical history, inquiring about any prior episodes of DD, and considering specific patient-related risk factors such as age, comorbidities, and diet. A thorough clinical presentation must also be gathered, including an assessment of the diaper area and any associated symptoms (e.g., blisters, ulcers).

It is crucial to differentiate between types of DD, such as irritant, allergic, or secondary infections like candidiasis, as well as other potential diagnoses and red flag signs and symptoms. Using a validated scale​[^[12]] to assess the severity of DD can help identify cases that may require further assessment.

#### Clinical Presentation

Diaper dermatitis can occur in patients of any age. Onset is gradual but may not be clinically apparent until there is an abrupt appearance of observable skin changes. DD is a “geographic” diagnosis—dermatosis is confined to the area bounded by the diaper: around the lower abdomen and the lumbar back at the level of the umbilicus and below; around the upper thighs, encompassing the genitalia, perineum and buttocks.​[^[6]] Presentation varies depending on whether the DD is irritant, allergic or secondarily infected (see Table 1). 

|  | Irritant | Allergic | Secondarily infected (Candidal)​[a] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Appearance | Varies with severity:Progressing from mild redness to shiny patches with deep redness to papules, vesicles and ulcers. Redness is more common in lightly pigmented skin. In darkly pigmented skin, the appearance may be dusky purple | Grouped or linear tense vesicles and blistersMarked edema in severe cases May resemble irritant diaper dermatitis | Plaques that appear beefy red in lightly pigmented skin or hyperpigmented, dark brown, purple or violaceous in darkly pigmented skin, with a well-demarcated, scaly border and satellite pustulesEarly maceration of the skin may occur, and if present, pustules may not always be visible |
| Location | Convex surfaces (buttocks, genitalia, lower abdomen, inner thighs)Inguinal folds are usually spared | Generally limited to area(s) in contact with the allergen; however, the affected area may extend away from the primary area of contact and may also include a more generalized eruptionIn severe cases, edema is particularly common in the genital region | Areas bound by diaper Almost always involves inguinal folds |
| Comments | Most common typeMay be asymptomatic or tenderCan resolve spontaneously or wax and wane | Least common typeOccurs only if the patient has an allergy to the causative agent | Second-most common typeCandida are part of intestinal flora and may be found in feces, providing a source of infectionCandida albicans is isolated in up to 80% of infants with perineal skin irritation that persists for ≥3 days​[4]Often painful: severe crying during diaper changes or when urinating or defecatingMay have a recent history of oral antibiotic use or diarrhea​[3]Oral thrush may also be present |


#### Risk and Aggravating Factors

Factors that compromise skin integrity and reduce barrier function may cause and aggravate DD. Examples of such factors are outlined in Table 2. Breastfeeding may be protective, with breastfed infants experiencing less diaper rash than formula-fed infants, presumably because their feces are less copious, less alkaline and less caustic.​[^[3]] Use of disposable diapers that are designed to wick urine and moisture away from the skin to the outer diaper layers may reduce the risk of DD.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] Furthermore, reducing the frequency of bathing and using a moisturizer may be protective—in one study, newborns who were bathed every 2 days and had a moisturizer applied at least once daily experienced less DD at 1 month than those bathed daily with no moisturizer applied.​[^[22]]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Patient-related | Age:infants—thin epidermis and a larger skin surface area relative to body volume, making them more vulnerable to irritants and moisture-related damageolder patients—atrophic skin, which is thinner and more fragile, increasing susceptibility to breakdown and secondary infectionsDiet:formula feeding: feces has higher pH; higher protease and lipase activitycow’s milk formula: colonized by a higher number of urease-producing bacteria than breast milkhigh-protein diet: increased pH of urine and fecescaffeine, citrus juices, spicy foods (from infant diet or breast milk): irritating when eliminated from the bodyPrevious episode(s) of diaper dermatitis​[25]Comorbid conditions: psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, malnourishment,​[4] seborrheic dermatitisPatients with impaired deactivation of digestive enzymes and bile salts in the colon (e.g., after intestinal resection), which creates an alkaline environmentIncreased urinary frequency or diarrhea leads to increased moisture, which can cause overhydration |
| Diaper-related | Infrequent diaper changes: prolonged contact time with urine, feces (and associated factors); moist environment supports microbial growth and skin macerationInadequate rinsing of reusable cloth diapers, which can lead to irritation due to residues of cleaning chemicalsUse of plastic covers over diapers to prevent leaks, which creates an occlusive environment |
| Chemical/drug-related | Use of soaps, detergents or other products in the diaper area that contain:boric acid,​[26]​[27] fragrances, volatile alcohol, e.g., ethyl, isopropylsurfactants (inherent irritancy varies​[6])high relative irritancy: sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), benzalkonium chloride​[28]low relative irritancy: disodium stearyl sulfosuccinateUse of medications that increase gastrointestinal motility, affect autonomic control of urination and defecation, or alter gastrointestinal flora (e.g., antibiotic therapy)Use of substances that may cause irritant or allergic contact dermatitis in the diaper area:​[11] bacitracin, balsam of Peru, ethylenediamine, lanolin, methylisothiazolinone (common in baby wipes),​[29] neomycin, PABA derivatives (e.g., benzocaine), parabens, sennosides,​[30]​[31] thimerosal, topical antihistamines |
| Friction-related | Frequent, vigorous cleansing and rubbing, which can cause mechanical stripping and barrier damageImmobilization (lying primarily in one position) |
| Additional risk factors | Lack of caregiver education on diaper hygieneGenetic predispositions that could exacerbate the condition |


#### Red Flags

Patients should be further evaluated, with consideration given to alternative or concomitant diagnoses, when presenting with DD characterized by any of the following: 



#### Differential Diagnosis

A summary of the possible differential diagnoses for DD is provided in Table 3. It is important to accurately identify and differentiate skin injuries with similar presentations to ensure the correct treatment plan is initiated and to allow for optimal skin healing.

| Diagnosis | Symptoms |
| --- | --- |
| Abuse/neglect​[15] | Severe diaper dermatitis that appears resistant to treatment sometimes may be associated with inadequate access to basic care resources. In some cases, socioeconomic barriers—such as limited access to diapers, moisturizers or health care—can contribute to prolonged diaper dermatitis. However, signs such as bruises, burns or scalds in the diaper area may warrant further evaluation for possible neglect or abuse. |
| Acrodermatitis enteropathica | Disorder of zinc metabolism leading to perioral, perineal and sacral skin erosions, along with erythematous, well-demarcated scaly plaques. Infants may also have alopecia, growth failure, diarrhea and irritability. |
| Atopic dermatitis (see Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis) | A history of pruritus, a family history of atopy, and atopic dermatitis elsewhere on the body is often present. Diaper area is typically spared, as the diaper provides a moist environment that hydrates the skin and prevents development. When the diaper area is affected, signs of chronic scratching may be seen.​[14] |
| Bullous impetigo (see Bacterial Skin Infections) | Large, flaccid bullae filled with straw-coloured liquid. Bullae generally rupture after 3–5 days, leaving red, denuded areas and honey-coloured crusts. Most often occurs in neonates and young infants, but can affect patients of any age. |
| Congenital syphilis | Skin lesions may be present at or after birth. They are characteristically copper-coloured in lightly pigmented skin and may appear hyperpigmented, violaceous or greyish in darkly pigmented skin. Lesions present as scaly macules and papules or moist erosions, which may be seen in the diaper area, around the mouth and around the nose. These lesions are highly infectious. Patients may also have anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice or bone involvement.​[14] |
| Eczema herpeticum (EH) | Rare but potentially serious condition. Often presents as small, monomorphic, dome-shaped papules or blisters that rupture to form ulcers overlying an erythematous base.​[32] Fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy may also be present. May be the result of autoinoculation in children with orofacial herpetic infection.​[33] Patients with atopic dermatitis or other chronic skin conditions are at greater risk of developing EH.​[32] |
| Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) | Rare and potentially life-threatening disorder. Rash is severe or recalcitrant and appears red-orange in lightly pigmented skin and hyperpigmented, violaceous, yellow-brown or greyish in darkly pigmented skin. Lesions present as scaly papules, erosions or petechiae. Most commonly seen in the groin, intertriginous regions and scalp. Can resemble seborrheic dermatitis. Patients may also have hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and lymphadenopathy.​[14] |
| Miliaria rubra (prickly heat, heat rash) | Caused by blockage or inflammation of sweat ducts. Typically presents as tiny red papules on lightly pigmented skin and grey or white papules on darkly pigmented skin that are sometimes itchy. When the diaper area is affected, it is most often seen at the elasticized opening of the diaper. Using plastic coverings over diapers can also cause this condition (increases occlusion). |
| Pinworms (see Pinworms) | Caused by a white roundworm; pinworm infestation causes anal pruritus (particularly at night), which can lead to difficulty sleeping and restlessness; suspect this if there is a school-aged child in the household. |
| Pressure Injury (see Pressure Ulcers) | Localized area over bony prominence with presentation ranging from nonblanchable erythema to epidermal separation. Recently updated staging systems describe the extent of tissue loss and the physical appearance of the injury caused by pressure or shear.​[34] |
| Psoriasis (see Psoriasis) | Bright red plaques on lightly pigmented skin or hyperpigmented on darkly pigmented skin in the diaper area, lack of silvery scale due to hydrating effect of diapers. Possible family history of psoriasis and typical lesions elsewhere on the body. Lack of response to low-dose topical steroids and antifungal medications. |
| Scabies (see Parasitic Skin Infections: Lice and Scabies) | Excoriations and ill-defined papular eruptions in the diaper area. Pruritic rash and burrows on palms, soles of feet, axilla, genitalia and finger webs. Other family members with similar lesions and a history of pruritus support diagnosis.​[14] |
| Seborrheic dermatitis (see Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis) | Well-circumscribed, red rash in lightly pigmented skin and hypo- or hyperpigmentation in darkly pigmented skin, with greasy, yellow to brown (in lightly pigmented skin) or hypopigmented (in darkly pigmented skin) scaly patches and plaques with flexural accentuation. Typically not itchy. May involve scalp, neck, face, axillae and retroauricular areas as well. Occurs in the first 6 months of life and is common in older adults. |


#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Diaper dermatitis represents a persistent challenge to the epidermal barrier. Although episodes of DD may resolve, complete restoration of barrier function in skin that has been previously damaged may be unattainable, particularly with ongoing exposure to irritants (urine and feces). As such, strategies for the prevention and treatment of DD are important for the duration of diaper use. There is no evidence that any single method is effective alone.​[^[35]] Combination methods, including nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures, should address all causative factors according to the ABCDE acronym (see Table 4). Note that discontinuing aggravating factors (see Table 2) is a critical first step in the management of DD. In fact, recent findings demonstrate that the key to efficient eradication of irritant DD lies in its prevention.​[^[5]]

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A(air, absorptives, antifungals, anti-inflammatories) | Air-drying should be encouraged to diminish damaging effects of occlusion and maceration. Remove diaper for as long as possible during cleansing, treatment and changes.Avoid practices that may cause chapping or burns, e.g., drying area with a hair dryer, exposure to infrared lamps.Use incontinence products with absorbent cores and breathable covers (e.g., most commercial disposable products) to increase aeration and hinder Candida albicans survival.​[6]Absorptives, antifungals and anti-inflammatories are reviewed in Pharmacologic Therapy. |
| B(barriers) | Apply a barrier product with each diaper change.Does not need to be completely removed at each change, unless soiled or applying another topical agent (e.g., an antifungal or corticosteroid).​[14]​[15]A barrier-absorptive base of zinc oxide in concentrations of 20–40% is the preferred barrier product for treatment of diaper dermatitis (DD); for prevention, lower concentrations of zinc oxide or barrier-only products (see Table 6) may be considered.Topical films or hydrocolloid dressings may be alternatives to topical creams and ointments, but further studies confirming effectiveness are needed before routinely recommending these products.Avoid powders due to risk of inadvertent inhalation.For more information on barrier products, see Barrier Products in Pharmacologic Therapy. |
| C(cleansing) | Cleansing:Rinsing with water and wiping gently with a soft cloth is sufficient to remove urine.​[40]Alternatively, hypoallergenic baby wipes can be used.Studies among healthy infants show cleansing with a wipe causes less skin irritation and surface roughness compared with water and a cotton washcloth or cotton balls.​[41]​[42]Use mild soap and warm water or hypoallergenic baby wipes for feces removal. Soapless cleansers or oil-in-water lotions are alternatives when skin irritation is exacerbated by frequent washing with soap and water (e.g., with atopic children).Products with a more acidic pH (similar to the skin) may reduce alkalization from fecal enzymes.​[43]Rinse area well (where applicable) and blot dry.Avoid wipes containing chemicals such as alcohol, fragrance, lanolin, methylisothiazolinone or soap. Wipes without sensitizers are as well-tolerated as water in the daily cleansing of infants with atopic dermatitis.​[41]Wipes should generally be discontinued if skin is broken (decision should be made on a case-by case-basis).Avoid overcleansing.Colloidal oatmeal added to bath water may also help with crusting and acute inflammation. |
| D(diapers) | Diapers act as a barrier and absorptive device.Comparative studies show that disposable diapers with absorbent gelling material decrease humidity more than reusable cloth diapers.During treatment for DD, disposable diapers may be preferred over cloth diapers.​[14]In a series of double-blind clinical trials, infants wearing breathable disposable diapers experienced significantly less (38–50%) DD (including candidal DD) compared with those using standard, nonbreathable disposable diapers.​[44] However, a systematic review found insufficient good-quality evidence to draw conclusions about the use of disposable diapers and prevention of DD.​[45]Change diapers frequently (Q2H for newborns or Q3–4H for older infants​[43] and whenever there is wetness or a bowel movement) to decrease occlusion, mechanical irritation, risk of secondary infection, and contact time with urine and feces.Smart technology utilizing diaper sensors allows for timely detection of increased moisture (e.g., by sending an alert to smart device), minimizing delays in diaper changes. Smart diapers are not yet marketed in Canada and differ from diapers with colour-changing wetness indicators in that the diaper does not need to be visually inspected to detect the presence of moisture.​[46]​[47]Double-diapering to decrease frequency of diaper changes is not recommended.Avoid plastic covers over the diaper area.​[15]Never use the apparently unsoiled part of a diaper to wipe or clean the diaper area.Wash cloth diapers with mild detergent, and ensure detergent is thoroughly rinsed out by running through an additional rinse cycle. Avoid water softeners and harsh soaps.A cup of vinegar in the final rinse water lowers the pH of cloth diapers.Commercial diaper services rinse diapers of harsh chemicals, sterilize and iron them to kill bacteria, fungi and yeasts.Diapers may be therapeutic for atopic children, as the “tropical” environment can effectively rehydrate dry, atopic skin.​[48] |
| E(education) | Educate patients and caregivers about both prevention and treatment of DD (see Diaper Rash—What You Need to Know)Prevention is key.Discontinuing aggravating factors ( see Table 2) is an essential first step in managing DD |


#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, see Baby Care Products: Diaper Rash.

An approach to the prevention and treatment of DD is presented in Figure 2.

Topical treatments are the mainstay of preventive and active therapy for DD. The success of therapy often depends as much on the choice of vehicle as on the active ingredient(s) present. A comparison of vehicles is provided in Table 5. Ideally, topical treatments for DD provide a semipermeable film or layer over the damaged skin to facilitate barrier repair, provide a physical shield between the skin and irritants, are not removed by urine or feces, maintain the acid mantle (acidic pH), and are easily removed from the skin with cleansing (to minimize stripping).​[^[6]]

| Vehicle | Consistency | Effect(s) | Additional Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lotions/Emulsion Creams | Thin | Mechanical protectionProvide a cooling effect |  |
| Ointments | Thick | Mechanical protectionSoften and lubricate the skin | Usually water-in-oil emulsions (low water content; anhydrous) |
| Pastes | Thick | Combine the action of both powders and ointments | Formed by incorporating powder into an ointment base |
| Powders | Incorporated into pastes | Protect mechanicallyAbsorb fluid (unless within a hydrophobic material or lipid)​[49]Decrease friction | Use of loose powders not recommended due to risk of inadvertent inhalation |


Begin treating DD at the first signs and symptoms: slight discoloration, dryness, dermatitis or abnormal skin anywhere in the diaper area (see Table 1). Pharmacologic options for DD prevention and treatment are summarized in Table 8. Re-evaluate and modify treatment plans if the condition worsens or does not improve within expected time frames (see Monitoring of Therapy).

#### Barrier Products

Barrier products are recommended for both the prevention *and* treatment of DD. They are considered the cornerstone of therapy for DD and can be of 2 types: 1) those that provide a water-impermeable barrier only and 2) those that provide a barrier and absorb water. Both types shield the skin from irritants, protect surfaces that are healing, and lubricate against maceration and friction. Barrier-absorptive bases also lessen overhydration and are generally preferred, as loss of barrier function and overhydration are both considered critical in the development of DD.

**Barrier-only products** suitable for use in DD are either oleaginous hydrocarbon–based (petrolatum), silicone-based or ceramide-based. Absorption bases (anhydrous lanolin, anhydrous eucerin) are not generally recommended because they are strong contact allergens. Barrier-only products are reviewed in Table 6.

**Barrier-absorptive bases** are usually creams or pastes with various percentages of zinc oxide. Zinc oxide, a mild antiseptic, is astringent and also functions as an absorptive powder at higher concentrations. Moderate concentrations of zinc oxide (e.g., 10–20%) are usually creams that are easy to spread and good for daily maintenance to prevent DD. Higher concentrations (up to 40%) are stiff, have enhanced absorptive and astringent properties, and are suitable for treatment of DD. Pastes are especially useful for DD associated with diarrhea or increased stool output.​[^[52]] They may need to be spread gently with a tongue depressor or spatula and removed with mineral oil. Although zinc absorption through the skin has been reported in a child with acrodermatitis enteropathica, and hyperzincemia has been reported in an infant after prolonged topical zinc oxide administration for refractory DD with skin erosion, zinc is a naturally occurring essential mineral and part of daily dietary requirements.​[^[53]]​[^[54]]

Barrier products may also contain additives, some of which are of dubious value, and other additives, which may be contact sensitizers. Vitamin A and dexpanthenol (a vitamin B5 derivative), for example, are popular additives, but these products show no additional benefit over zinc oxide, lanolin or petrolatum alone.​[^[55]] Similarly, a study involving 114 newborns showed no difference in DD treated with an ointment containing vitamin A versus the vehicle alone.​[^[56]] Glycerin, a humectant at concentrations of 20–45%, is frequently added to products at lower concentrations (at which it is inactive as a humectant) to ensure shelf-life only. Other additives, including astringents like hamamelis (witch hazel), are sensitizing, making plain barrier products preferable.

The effectiveness of topical creams and lotions may be limited by their short duration of effect and removal with diaper changes (pastes and ointments may be preferred).​[^[15]] Topical films (solutions and sprays that dry to form a semipermeable barrier on the skin) may be an alternative. They are intended to remain in place to protect the skin from direct contact with irritants and to facilitate barrier repair. Films also minimize skin stripping from cleansing procedures. Trials of these products lacked sufficient participants to conclusively determine the effectiveness and time course of improvement relative to conventional barrier products.​[^[57]]​[^[58]]

The use of **hydrocolloid dressings** for the treatment of DD in hospitalized infants has also been evaluated. Infants treated with hydrocolloid dressings and individualized nursing care had significantly better healing rates and fewer adverse events than infants treated with mupirocin plaster or zinc oxide plaster and routine nursing care.​[^[59]] These findings are promising, but data on the safety and efficacy of hydrocolloid dressings in the setting of DD is limited and further evaluation is warranted.

**Powders** have been traditionally used as barrier products in the diaper area; however, it is now recommended that they be avoided due to risk of inadvertent inhalation. Furthermore, cornstarch may serve as a culture medium for C. albicans.​[^[37]]​[^[36]] Talcum powder has been associated with lung disease and ovarian cancer in adults​[^[60]] and baking soda has been reported to cause metabolic alkalosis in an infant being treated for DD.​[^[39]] Powders may also form a crust and bleed upon removal if applied to broken or oozing skin.

| Barrier Product | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| Ceramide-based | Used as protectantHave not been compared with other barriersAssist in maintaining normal barrier function and reduce transepidermal water loss by increasing the ceramide:cholesterol ratio (which is decreased in irritated skin)Do not absorb excess moisture |
| Petrolatum (yellow or decolourized white) | Oleaginous hydrocarbon baseTranslucent, oil-phase, greasy preparationNo capacity to absorb water—trap moisture on the skin surface and may lead to macerationMineral-derived, which may be irritating to inflamed skinEvidence is lacking and although one study showed no significant difference in preventing DD when compared with controls,​[51] petrolatum is widely recommended and anecdotally effective for prevention of DD |
| Silicone-based | Contain dimethicone (dimeticone) or dimethylpolysiloxaneWater-repellent onlySoothe by protecting against irritants |


#### Topical Antifungals

If perineal skin irritation is present for 3 days or more, a **topical antifungal** with anti-yeast activity is often necessary, as the area is likely critically colonized with Candida transferred from the bowel via feces. This should be considered even if classic signs of a candidal infection (DD that is beefy red with a scaly border and satellite pustules, involving inguinal folds) have not yet appeared.

Topical imidazoles are the treatment of choice. Topical miconazole or clotrimazole are generally 70–90% effective against Candida within 1 week of treatment. Topical miconazole is well tolerated and has been reported to be significantly more effective than zinc oxide or petrolatum for treatment of DD complicated by candidiasis.​[^[61]]​[^[62]] 

Nystatin, a polyene antifungal, is an alternative to imidazole therapy but is considered slightly less effective (approximately 70% effectiveness). Clinical response to clotrimazole, for example, was superior to nystatin in infants with DD in a randomized, controlled study.​[^[63]] Nystatin typically requires longer treatment (about 2 weeks) for symptoms to resolve and may cause fabric staining. Topical ciclopirox is another alternative, with one study showing a significant reduction in severity and an increased cure rate among infants with DD.​[^[64]] It is sometimes recommended because of its additional broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Topical ciclopirox is considered superior to nystatin, but inferior to imidazoles in terms of clinical efficacy.

Antifungal preparations function to keep the antifungal at the skin surface, where they can release the medication to attack yeast in the stratum corneum. They should be applied first, followed by the barrier cream. Once inflammation has subsided, discontinue the anti-yeast preparation and continue treatment with the barrier cream.

Oral antifungal therapy is not recommended for immunocompetent patients, as it can promote colonization with resistant Candida. Furthermore, no difference in initial clinical response has been shown with concomitant oral therapy.​[^[65]]

#### Topical Corticosteroids

In DD that is predominantly inflammatory, topical hydrocortisone 0.5–1% can be applied to the occluded area under the diaper for short periods (1–2 wk only). While caution should be exercised when used in children under 2 years of age, these concentrations of hydrocortisone are widely used in this population and rarely cause side effects if used appropriately. More potent corticosteroids are not recommended, as absorption due to heat and moisture can cause serious side effects (e.g., Cushing syndrome).​[^[66]]​[^[67]]

Topical hydrocortisone 0.5–1% can be added to therapy if inflammation is prominent; use with a barrier cream if irritant DD is suspected and with an antifungal preparation in cases where *Candida* is suspected. If used as a cream or ointment with an anti-yeast cream in a polyethylene glycol base, the corticosteroid should be applied first. Hydrocortisone 1% is sometimes added extemporaneously as a powder to commercial antifungal preparations to facilitate adherence. Equal parts of hydrocortisone and antifungal creams should not be mixed, as the resultant product contains half the required concentration of each active agent and half the required concentration of preservative. This may lead to a lack of therapeutic response and the possibility of resistance with continued use.

Combinations of antifungals and mid- to high-potency corticosteroids (e.g., nystatin and triamcinolone, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate) are not recommended due to the risk of corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy and adrenal suppression.​[^[2]]​[^[14]]

Pharmacologic options for the prevention and treatment of DD are summarized in Table 8.

#### Topical Human Breast Milk

Topically applied human breast milk has been studied for its effects in treating DD. This use of breast milk has been compared with zinc oxide barrier cream (40%) with no significant difference except that zinc oxide showed a better decrease in lesion score.​[^[68]] In another study, topical human breast milk was as effective as hydrocortisone 1% ointment after 1 week in treatment of infants with DD.​[^[69]]

#### Natural Health Products

Evidence is lacking for the use of natural health products in the prevention and treatment of DD. Preliminary evidence suggest that certain **probiotics** given orally or topically may be useful in preventing or treating DD.​[^[69]] Various other products (e.g., ***Calendula officinalis***,​[^[71]] **honey**, **olive oil**, **beeswax**,​[^[72]] **guaiazulene**,​[^[73]] **henna** oil cream,​[^[74]] **argan spinosa**​[^[75]]) have been reported to be beneficial, but trials have been small. In many cases, natural health products are sold with few instructions, may not be regulated as to purity or potential toxicity, and should not be recommended.​[^[76]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 7 provides a monitoring framework for patients with DD. Parameters should be monitored daily by the patient or caregiver. Symptoms should improve within 7 days. If they do not, or if red flag symptoms develop, patients should be assessed further, with consideration of an alternative diagnosis. If symptoms improve significantly but do not resolve completely, consider continuing treatment for another 7 days. Taper therapy appropriately in response to improvement or resolution. The health-care practitioner should be responsible for ensuring the treatment plan remains on schedule, is effective, and that no adverse effects are occurring. Contact the patient or caregiver in 1 week to determine progress. If allergic reactions occur, discontinue therapy. If the condition worsens due to irritation, alter therapy or refer as appropriate.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a medical flowchart for the prevention and management of diaper dermatitis (DD) in patients wearing diapers. It outlines a decision-making process based on the effectiveness of treatment and the presence of red flags.

### Flowchart Description:

1. **Initial Step:**
   - **Instruction:** Follow the ABCDEs for DD prevention and apply a protectant barrier with each diaper change (e.g., zinc oxide 10–20%, petrolatum, silicone, ceramide-based).

2. **Effectiveness Check:**
   - **Question:** Is the treatment effective?
   - **Yes:** Continue with the current regimen.
   - **No:** Further assessment is required with consideration of alternative diagnosis.

3. **Red Flags Assessment:**
   - **Question:** Does the patient have any of the following red flags?
     - Acute onset with oozing, pus, vesicles, or ulceration
     - Frequent recurrences, especially without an intermittent rash-free period
     - Severe presentation with systemic signs/symptoms (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting)
     - Rash or lesions present outside the diaper area
     - Complicated secondary infection or co-morbid UTI
     - Significant behavioral changes (e.g., incessant crying, lethargy, sleep)
     - Signs of abuse or neglect
     - Immunocompromised
     - Symptoms fail to improve despite 7 days of appropriate treatment or fail to resolve after 14 days of appropriate treatment
   - **Yes:** Further assessment required.
   - **No:** Follow the ABCDEs for prevention, including applying a protectant barrier at each diaper change.

4. **Ineffectiveness Check:**
   - **Question:** Is the treatment ineffective?
   - **Yes:** 
     - Ensure adherence to ABCDE measures.
     - Change barrier to zinc oxide 20–40%.
     - If signs or symptoms of Candida infection are present, add a topical antifungal.
     - If DD is predominantly inflammatory (e.g., red, swollen, warm, painful), add hydrocortisone 0.5–1%.
   - **Follow-up:** Reassess in 7 days.

5. **Follow-up Outcomes:**
   - **If symptoms have resolved:** Discontinue treatment, continue ABCDE measures for prevention.
   - **If symptoms have significantly improved but not resolved:** Continue treatment for another 7 days.
   - **If symptoms have worsened or not improved:** Refer for further evaluation.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing diaper dermatitis, emphasizing prevention, monitoring effectiveness, and addressing complications.

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Onset/Duration | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ciclopirox olamine 1%** (Loprox) | Massage into affected area and surrounding skin BID | Onset: clinical improvement and relief of pruritus within 1 wk.Duration: continue for minimum of 4 wk. | Transient pruritus, mild burning at application site. | Also has broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Considered inferior to topical imidazoles (but superior to nystatin). |
| **nystatin 100 000 units/gram** (generics) | Massage into affected area and surrounding skin BID–TID | Onset: within 24–72 h after initiation of therapy.Duration: continue ≥ 2 wk. | Irritation (rash, urticaria) primarily due to preservatives (parabens) in some formulations.May stain clothing. | Effective only against Candida.Slightly less effective than imidazole therapy and often requires longer treatment. |
| **clotrimazole 1%** (Canesten, generics) | Massage into affected area and surrounding skin BID | Onset: clinical improvement and relief of pruritus within 1 wk.Duration: continue for minimum of 1–2 wk. | Blistering, irritation, mild burning, transient pruritus, stinging at application site. | Some anti-inflammatory and gram-positive antibacterial action.Cross-sensitivity with other azole derivatives.Topical imidazoles are the treatment of choice for DD secondarily infected with Candida. |
| **ketoconazole 2%** (generics) | Patients 12 y+: apply to affected area and surrounding skin once to twice dailyPatients <12 y: safety and efficacy have not been established, but has been used without unusual adverse effects in a limited number of children​[14]​[15] | Onset: clinical improvement and relief of pruritus within 1 wk.Duration: continue for minimum of 1–2 wk. | Blistering, irritation, mild burning, transient pruritus, stinging at application site. | Manufacturer recommends once-daily application for cutaneous candidiasis; however, application frequency may be increased to twice daily for more resistant cases.​[50]Some anti-inflammatory and gram-positive antibacterial action.Cross-sensitivity with other azole derivatives.Topical imidazoles are the treatment of choice for DD secondarily infected with Candida. |
| **miconazole nitrate 2%** (Micatin, Monistat Derm, generics) | Massage into affected area and surrounding skin BID | Onset: clinical improvement and relief of pruritus within 1 wk.Duration: continue for minimum of 1–2 wk. | Blistering, irritation, mild burning, transient pruritus, stinging at application site. | Some anti-inflammatory and gram-positive antibacterial action.Cross-sensitivity with other azole derivatives.Topical imidazoles are the treatment of choice for DD secondarily infected with Candida. |
| **ceramides-based protectants** (CeraVe Baby Healing Ointment) | Apply generously PRN | Onset: skin protection is immediate.Duration: skin protection lasts about 3 h. | Mild burning or stinging lasting 10–15 min. | Does not need to be removed completely at each diaper change (unless soiled or applying another topical agent). For prevention only. |
