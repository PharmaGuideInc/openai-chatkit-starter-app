#### Lice (Pediculosis)

#### Pathophysiology

Lice are tiny, blood-sucking insects that are specific parasites of humans. Outbreaks in institutions such as schools and long-term care facilities are common, with an estimated prevalence of head lice of 1–3% in elementary school-aged children.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]

Three species of lice exist: head lice (*Pediculus humanus capitis*), pubic lice (*Phthirus pubis* or “crabs”) and body lice (*Pediculus humanus corporis*). Lice are obligate human parasites; survival time off the human host varies. See Table 1 for information on the characteristics of the 3 types of lice and infestations involving them.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Patients with recurrent or unresponsive head lice or pubic lice require further assessment and/or treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner. Characteristics of the 3 types of lice are compared in Table 1.

| Characteristic | Head Lice(Pediculus humanus capitis) | Pubic Lice(Phthirus pubis) | Body Lice(Pediculus humanus corporis) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Appearance​[a] | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovals, often confused with dandruffLouse: up to 4 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs ending in small claws, grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovals, often confused with skin flakesLouse: up to 2 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs (the 2 pairs of legs closest to the rear have large crab-like claws), grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings | Nits/eggs: <1 mm in length, yellow-brown to grey-white dots or ovalsLouse: up to 3 mm in length with 3 pairs of legs ending in claws, grey-white to tan-brown (darker after feeding), no wings |
| Life cycle​[a] | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatchLouse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 7–15 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days on the scalp, with females laying 5–10 eggs per day. Infestation usually involves <10 live lice | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatchLouse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 10–17 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days on the affected body area, with females laying approximately 3 eggs per day. Infestation of the pubic hair usually involves an average of 12 live lice | Nits/eggs: 6–10 days to hatchLouse: nymphs molt 3 times and become adults 9–12 days after hatching. Adults live up to 30 days in the clothing if it is being continually worn by the host. Female lice lay up to 8 eggs per day. Infested patients typically have <10 active lice on the skin at any one time but clothing may contain hundreds |
| Survival time away from host​[a] | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to surviveLouse: 1–2 days | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to surviveLouse: 1–2 days | Nits/eggs: may survive up to 30 days but will not hatch if the temperature is <22°C. Blood meal needed immediately upon hatching to surviveLouse: 1–2 days |
| Lesions/symptoms | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules around ears, face and neck; pruritic scalpSecondary: excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections; enlarged cervical and nuchal lymph nodes | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules, pruritus in the anogenital area. Possibly small brown specks on undergarments due to lice excretaSecondary: excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections. In heavy infestations, bite sites may reveal a blue-grey skin discoloration which may not be as noticeable on darker skin | Primary: hypersensitivity reaction to louse saliva or feces including papules, pruritus (worse at night), particularly around neck, waist and axillaeSecondary: linear excoriations, crusts; pustules with secondary infections. In extended, heavy infestations, there may be a blue-grey darkening (possibly not as noticeable on darker skin) and thickening of the skin, fatigue, anemia |
| Location of lice/nits | Scalp hair, particularly in the warmer parts of the head (behind ears and at nape of neck). Nits are laid at base of hair shaft; therefore, viable eggs usually located within 6 mm of scalp | Pubic hair (uncommonly other areas with coarse hair such as eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, chest hair, axillae). Nits are laid at base of hair shaft | Along the seams of clothing worn close to the body where it is warmer. Occasionally a live louse may be seen clinging to body hair |
| Transmission | Head-to-head contactUncommonly, by items that come into contact with an infested person, e.g., hats, scarves, combs, hair accessories, furniture, carpetNot transmitted between humans and animals | Sexual exposure (most common); close physical contact; sharing clothing, bedding or towels with an infected personNot transmitted between humans and animals | Clothing or bedding; conditions of poor hygiene. Unlikely to be transmitted if clothing or bedding laundered at least once per wkUnlike head and pubic lice, body lice are vectors of human diseases such as typhus, relapsing fever, trench fever and endocarditisNot transmitted between humans and animals |
| Host | Primarily childrenHighest incidence in ages 3–11 yMuch less common among people of African-Americans descent, possibly due to the claws of the louse being less adept at grasping the shaft of tightly coiled hair types | Primarily sexually active individuals | Primarly persons with poor hygiene (unable to launder clothes and bedding at least once per wk) |
| Differential diagnosis | DandruffHair casts (thin, elongated, cylinder-shaped segments of dandruff that encircle the hair shaft and are easily dislodged)Seborrheic dermatitisAccumulation of hair cosmetics | Seborrheic dermatitisFolliculitisDermatophytosis (e.g., tinea cruris)Arthropod bitesScabies | Seborrheic dermatitisFlea bites or other insect bitesAtopic dermatitis/contact dermatitisImpetigoFolliculitisRenal or hepatic impairment causing pruritusDrug reaction |


#### Diagnosis



Pubic lice: Diagnosis is made when live lice are detected in the hair of the affected area. Pubic lice is considered a sexually transmitted infection; further assessment for the presence of other sexually transmitted infections is recommended in patients diagnosed with pubic lice.​[^[12]]

Body lice: Diagnosis is made when live lice are detected in the seams of clothing.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy



See also Figure 1 and Figure 2.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Keep safety considerations and ease of administration in mind when choosing a pediculicide. See Table 5 for more information.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Pediculicides.

#### Head Lice

Family members and close contacts of individuals with head lice should be examined and treated at the same time if infested. Treatment should be repeated in 7 days. Some sources suggest bedmates should be treated prophylactically.​[^[16]]​[^[35]] See also Figure 1.



The “no-nit” policy requiring children be free of nits before returning to school has not been effective in mitigating outbreaks. Consequently, it is recommended that parents of an affected child be notified, and that the child not be sent home early, but instead receive treatment with an effective pediculicide that evening and return to school the next morning.​[^[7]]​[^[16]]​[^[35]]

#### Head Lice Treatment Failures

Treatment failure can occur due to misdiagnosis, improper use of pediculicide (e.g., hair not saturated from scalp to ends or product not left on hair long enough), not repeating the treatment after 7–10 days, reapplication too soon after initial application, inadequate manual removal of nits, repeated exposure to lice (reinfestation) or resistance to a pediculicide.

Resistance to the neurotoxic agents pyrethrins and permethrin has developed in countries with heavy pediculicide usage such as France, Czech Republic, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.​[^[48]] Formal collection of resistance patterns has not been done in Canada, so the prevalence of resistance is unknown. In countries with documented resistance, the appropriate choice has been dependent on local resistance patterns, which continue to change.​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]] 



Itching does not necessarily mean that a reinfestation has occurred. Itching can be caused by an inflammatory response to the pediculicide and may persist for several days after treatment. An **oral antihistamine** or low-potency **topical corticosteroid** may be required for relief.

#### Pubic Lice

The pediculicides used to treat head lice are effective for pubic lice (see Table 5 and Figure 2). The recommended regimens are **permethrin 1%** or **pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide**, with retreatment in 7–9 days.​[^[8]]​[^[10]]​[^[12]]

If eyelashes are infested, nits and lice can be removed with tweezers. It is suggested that manual removal of lice be followed by an application of an **occlusive nonmedicated eye ointment** (e.g., LacriLube) twice daily for 10 days.​[^[10]]​[^[12]] Regular white petrolatum (“Vaseline”) should be avoided, as it can be irritating to the eyes.​[^[13]] Although more data are needed to determine the efficacy of occlusive agents in asphyxiating lice,​[^[47]] it is also thought that the ointment will facilitate removal of any remaining nits.​[^[13]]

 Sexual contacts within the previous month should be treated at the same time, if possible.​[^[10]]​[^[12]] Persistent itching may be caused by a reaction to the pediculicide and can be treated with an **oral antihistamine** or **topical corticosteroid**.​[^[12]]

#### Body Lice

Pediculicides are unnecessary. Laundering of clothing and bedding as described in Nonpharmacologic Therapy is considered effective for the eradication of body lice, and future infestations can be prevented by laundering clothes and bedding at least weekly.​[^[10]]

#### Natural Health Products

Several natural health products are used as alternative pediculicides (e.g., anacyclus pyrethrum, anamirta, chrysanthemum flowers, delphinium, field scabious, henna, tea tree oil, black pepper, ranunculus). There is insufficient clinical evidence of efficacy for any of these herbs.​[^[19]]​[^[61]]

**Lavender oil** and tea tree oil are often used in toiletries and in products to treat head lice. They have been associated with cases of prepubertal gynecomastia in boys with normal endogenous steroid levels.​[^[62]] 

#### Monitoring of Therapy

After treatment of head and pubic lice, the dead nits will still be attached to the hair. They can be removed with fingertips, tweezers or a fine-tooth (nit) comb. Observe for any recurrence of lice and nits. Further assessment and/or treatment is required for patients with recurrent or unresponsive head lice or pubic lice following 2 treatments with recommended therapy.

For body lice infestations, inspect clothing and other personal items for the presence of lice.

A secondary bacterial skin infection with redness and pus may develop and may require topical antibacterial treatment. A monitoring plan for patients with pediculosis can be found in Table 2.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Treatment | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Detection of live lice | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Absence of live lice 24 h after applying pediculicide | Treat again with pediculicide 7–10 days after initial application to eradicate any recently hatched immature nymphs. Presence of adult lice may indicate resistance and need for change of therapy. |
| Presence of nits | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Absence of nits | Vinegar, nit comb to physically remove dead nits. |
| Pruritus | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Relief of pruritus | Oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids. |
| Inflammatory pustules | Patient: daily for 2 wk | Clearing of any lesions and return to normal appearance of the skin within 1 wk of treatment | If mild, topical antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin/polymyxin B). If unresponsive or extensive, systemic antibiotics may be necessary. Note that inflammatory pustules are not always infectious (may be due to host inflammatory response), in which case they would be unresponsive to antibiotics. |


#### Scabies

#### Pathophysiology

Scabies is a highly contagious infestation of the skin with the microscopic human mite, *Sarcoptes scabiei* var. *hominis*. It can occur across all socioeconomic levels. Cycles of epidemics every 7–15 years occur in crowded living conditions and in institutions.​[^[12]]​[^[63]] See Table 2 for information on the characteristics and assessment of scabies.

Immunocompromised hosts such as patients with HIV infection or lymphoma or institutionalized elderly persons may develop an atypical, hyperkeratotic and more contagious form of scabies called crusted scabies (also referred to as Norwegian scabies). Patients present with pronounced thickened skin patches that primarily affect the face, scalp, hands and feet but may be generalized. The lesions may be malodorous, and pruritus is minimal. Infested persons have huge numbers of mites (often hundreds of thousands) and this infection carries a high mortality rate due to secondary infection and sepsis.​[^[12]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]]​[^[66]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Table 3 provides characteristics and assessment of scabies.

Suspect scabies in all patients with a pruritic rash, especially if it worsens at night. Papules appearing on the genitalia and breasts when other household members have similar signs and symptoms strengthen the diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis should be made by an appropriate health-care practitioner prior to treatment.​[^[66]]

Definitive diagnosis is made by mounting scrapings from nonexcoriated burrows, papules or vesicles in potassium hydroxide onto a slide and examining under direct microscopy. Any sign of a mite, eggs or fecal material is a positive test.​[^[72]]​[^[73]] The **burrow ink test** may help to visualize burrows: apply ink or washable marker to skin in the area of a suspected burrow, wipe away the ink with alcohol, burrows will retain the ink and be visible.​[^[12]]​[^[74]]

| Characteristic |  |
| --- | --- |
| Appearance​[a] | Mites: up to 0.3–0.45 mm in length (eggs 0.1–0.15 mm), not usually visible to the human eye but may appear as tiny black or white dots on the skin. Rounded body with 4 pairs of legs, no wings. Usually visualized (for diagnosis) by looking at skin scrapings under a microscope. |
| Life cycle​[a] | Impregnated female burrows (creates a tunnel) into the uppermost layer (stratum corneum) of the epidermis, depositing feces along its path, and lays 2 or 3 eggs daily. She remains in the burrow and continues to lay eggs for her lifespan of 1–2 months. Three or 4 days later, the eggs hatch into larvae with 6 legs that travel from the burrow to the skin surface where they mature into adult mites within 14–17 days. On warm skin, mites are capable of crawling 2.5 cm per minute. The smaller male mite lives predominantly on the skin surface and dies shortly after mating with the female mite. Patients typically harbour an average of 10–12 mites. |
| Survival time away from host​[a] | Mites: 2–3 days. In a cool, humid environment, survival may be increased up to about 19 days. |
| Lesions/symptoms | Pruritus: intense pruritus (worse at night) as a result of sensitization to the mites, eggs or feces starting after 2–6 wk with first infection, and within 1–2 days with reinfection.Primary lesions: linear or wavy silvery lines (burrows) 2–5 mm long with papules and vesicles near burrows. Children may have atypical lesions.Secondary lesions: scratching leads to excoriations that may become secondarily infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococci pyogenes leading to pustules, furunculosis and impetigo. In areas of high prevalence, scabies is a risk factor for developing acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.Pruritus due to an inflammatory response to the pediculicide or an allergic reaction to mites and their feces may persist for 4–6 wk after treatment and does not necessarily indicate treatment failure. See photo, Scabies. |
| Distribution of mites | Fingerwebs, wrists, sides of hands and feet, axillae, groin, areola and nipples, belt line.Face and scalp spared in adults but not in infants and young children, the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.Children: lesions are often concentrated on hands, feet, scalp and body folds. |
| Transmission | Most commonly through close personal contact, particularly sexual contact. Spread by fomites such as furniture and towels is rare unless there was contact with patients with a very high parasite load.Animals do not spread human scabies. Scabies mites from other species may produce a self-limited infestation in humans but they will not multiply on the human host. |
| Host | More likely in those living in close, crowded conditions.Most common in children.Poor hygiene does not lead to scabies. |
| Differential diagnosis | Flea or insect bites: lesions are usually single or multiple papules.Atopic dermatitis: distribution is typically behind knees or in fold of elbows for children and adults, or on face and outer aspect of knees and elbows for infants.Seborrheic dermatitis: scales in a distribution involving the scalp and face.Impetigo: exhibits honey-coloured exudates and crusting; this may appear as a secondary infection. |

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a section of human skin with multiple small, red lesions. These lesions appear to be scattered across the skin surface, varying in size and shape. Some areas show more concentrated clusters of redness, while others have isolated spots. The skin around the lesions appears slightly inflamed. There are no visible labels or annotations in the image. The overall appearance suggests a dermatological condition, possibly involving irritation or a rash.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a skin surface with a prominent, raised lesion. The skin appears to have a rough texture with some scaling. The lesion is centrally located, round, and slightly darker than the surrounding skin. It appears to be a papule or nodule. The surrounding skin shows signs of hyperpigmentation and possibly lichenification, which could indicate chronic irritation or scratching. There are no visible signs of ulceration or active inflammation. This type of presentation could be consistent with a dermatological condition, but further clinical evaluation would be necessary for diagnosis.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up view of a foot, focusing on the toes. The skin appears dry and scaly, with a rough texture. There is noticeable thickening and discoloration, with a darkened hue over the toes. The toenails are thickened and have a yellowish tint, which may indicate a fungal infection or other nail disorder. The skin between the toes appears to be affected as well, with similar dryness and scaling. This presentation could be indicative of a dermatological condition such as psoriasis, eczema, or a fungal infection like athlete's foot.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy



See also Figure 3.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of the traditional recommendation to treat close contacts of patients with scabies prophylactically.​[^[76]] However, Health Canada recommends preventive treatment of sexual partners within the last month​[^[12]] and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends treatment (ideally simultaneous) of all household contacts whether symptomatic or not.​[^[70]] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that close contacts within the month preceding the infestation should be examined and treated if infested.​[^[37]]

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments—*Skin Care Products: Scabicides.

#### Topical Therapy

**Permethrin 5%** is an insecticide that appears to be more effective than all other topical scabicides available in Canada​[^[77]]​[^[78]]​[^[79]] and it is the preferred treatment for adults and children >2 months of age.​[^[12]]​[^[37]] There are limited human studies of permethrin in pregnancy;​[^[54]] however, less than 2% of the topical dose of permethrin is absorbed and it is considered the drug of choice for treating scabies in pregnant and breastfeeding patients.​[^[12]]​[^[80]] Concerns about emerging resistance to permethrin are not supported by evidence, and experts suggest that incorrect/incomplete treatment, reinfestation or other factors related to high-risk groups may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of scabies seen in some areas.​[^[81]]​[^[82]]

**Topical** ivermectin was found to have similar efficacy to permethrin in a systematic review, but is not available for this indication in Canada.​[^[81]]

Comparative trials of other scabicides, including **sulfur** and **crotamiton**, have produced equivocal results suggesting there is no most effective second-line agent.​[^[77]]

Topical **sulfur** has many mechanisms of action including keratolytic, fungicidal, parasiticidal and antibacterial activity. Its germicidal activity may be the result of conversion to pentathionic acid by epidermal cells or by certain microorganisms. In organisms without lungs, such as insects or plants, sulfur prevents respiration. There is limited evidence of efficacy,​[^[77]]​[^[83]] but it is often recommended in a petrolatum base as therapy for infants <2 months of age due to low risk of toxicity.​[^[70]] Odour and mess associated with application reduce adherence and limit use. Sulfur is considered a second-line agent.

**Crotamiton** 10% cream is an antiparasitic agent with an unknown mechanism of action. It reduces itch via a counterirritant effect (creates a cooling sensation as it evaporates from the skin). Crotamiton is less effective than permethrin​[^[84]] and may be less effective at reducing persistent itch; resistance has been reported.​[^[78]]​[^[85]] It is considered a second-line agent. It was discontinued in Canada in 2023.

Lindane is an effective scabicide; however, there are concerns about possible serious adverse effects​[^[39]]​[^[40]] and it is no longer available in Canada.

See also Figure 3 and Table 6.

#### Systemic Therapy

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent commonly used worldwide for various parasitic infections.



No serious drug-related adverse events due to ivermectin have been reported. Adverse effects are thought to result from the death of parasites rather than adverse effects from the drug. Low levels of ivermectin are detected in the CNS as it concentrates in the liver and fat tissue. No significant drug interactions have been reported. It is not recommended in children <15 kg since safety is unknown.​[^[56]] However one observational study in infants and children <15 kg showed only mild adverse effects in approximately 4% of patients.​[^[57]] See Table 6 for more information, including use in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

The appearance of new burrows at any stage after treatment is an indication for further treatment. Itch resulting from an immune allergic response to the mite can persist for up to 4 weeks and may be relieved with topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines.​[^[12]]​[^[93]]​[^[94]] Table 4 presents a monitoring plan for patients with scabies.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Treatment | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Burrows | Patient: daily for the following 2 wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Clearing of burrows over the following 2 wk and return to normal skin appearance | If new burrows are detected, then retreatment with a scabicide is necessary. Ensure nonpharmacologic measures are utilized. |
| Papules | Patient: daily for the following 2 wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Clearing of papules and return to normal skin appearance | If new papules are detected, then retreatment with a scabicide is necessary after 7–10 days. Ensure nonpharmacologic measures are utilized. |
| Pruritus | Patient: daily for several wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | Itching should resolve within several (up to 4) wk; itching beyond 4 wk requires reinvestigation of the cause​[94] | If itching persists for several wk, then antihistamines or topical corticosteroids may be tried as antipruritic agents.​[85]​[97] |
| Pustules, impetigo | Patient: daily for several wk Health-care practitioner: next visit | This secondary infection should improve with 3 days of topical antibacterial (bacitracin/polymyxin B) treatment | If no improvement or worsening within 3 days of treatment, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |

**Drug Class: Scabicides**

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Administration Instructions | Adverse Effects | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ivermectin** (Stromectol) | Resistant or severe scabies after failure of topical therapy:​[b] 200 mcg/kg single dose, repeated in 2 wk.Crusted/Norwegian scabies: 200 mcg/kg single dose on days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15 (and days 22 and 29 in severe, unresponsive cases) in combination with topical permethrin cream.Institutional epidemics when topical therapy fails or is impractical: 200 mcg/kg single dose for the entire at-risk population (repeated in 7–14 days). | Aggravation of symptoms including pruritus, gastrointestinal upset, irritation, headache, rash. | Not a Health Canada–approved use.Not recommended in children <15 kg, as safety is not established. One observational study in infants and children <15 kg reported only mild adverse effects in approximately 4% of patients.​[57]Safety during pregnancy has not been established; however, no teratogenic or fetotoxic effects have been documented in human pregnancy and it is felt to pose a low risk to the fetus.​[36]​[37]Limited data indicate that ivermectin is poorly transferred into breast milk.​[58] The CDC considers ivermectin to be probably compatible with breastfeeding.​[37] |
| **permethrin** (Kwellada-P Lotion, Nix Dermal Cream) | Single treatment: massage into all skin areas from the neck down to the soles of the feet; every bit of skin must be treated, including the fingernails, waist and genitalia.
