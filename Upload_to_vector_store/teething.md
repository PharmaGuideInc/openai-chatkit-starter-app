#### Pathophysiology

The normal primary dentition (also called deciduous or milk teeth) is composed of a total of 20 teeth, divided as follows: 4 incisors, 2 canines (cuspids) and 4 molars on each arch. The complete permanent (adult) dentition includes a total of 32 teeth: 4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 premolars and 6 molars in each arch.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]] Figure 1 depicts the normal primary and permanent dentition. Figure 2 represents the normal anatomy of an adult molar and its related structures. Table 1 presents the usual age range for tooth eruption.

| Teeth | Upper (maxillary) | Lower (mandibular) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary |  |  |
| Central incisors | 7–12 months | 6–10 months |
| Lateral incisors | 9–13 months | 7–16 months |
| Canines (cuspids) | 16–22 months | 16–23 months |

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a detailed anatomical diagram of a tooth, illustrating its internal and external structures. Here is a breakdown of the contents:

### Sections of the Tooth:
1. **Crown**: The visible part of the tooth above the gum line.
2. **Root**: The part of the tooth below the gum line, anchoring it in the jawbone.
3. **Apex**: The tip of the root.

### Layers and Structures:
- **Enamel**: The outermost, hard protective layer of the crown.
- **Dentin**: The layer beneath the enamel, forming the bulk of the tooth structure.
- **Coronal Pulp**: The soft tissue within the crown, containing nerves and blood vessels.
- **Radicular Pulp**: The continuation of the pulp into the root.

### Supporting Structures:
- **Blood and Nerve Supply**: Indicated within the pulp, providing nourishment and sensation.
- **Cementoenamel Junction**: The area where the enamel and cementum meet.
- **Sulcus**: The groove between the tooth and the gum.
- **Gingiva**: The gum tissue surrounding the teeth.

### Root and Surrounding Structures:
- **Alveolar Bone**: The part of the jawbone that contains the tooth sockets.
- **Cementum**: The calcified layer covering the root, helping anchor the tooth.
- **Periodontal Ligament**: The fibrous tissue that connects the tooth to the alveolar bone.
  
This diagram provides a comprehensive view of the tooth's anatomy, highlighting both the internal components and the surrounding supportive structures.

#### Primary Teeth

The eruption of the primary teeth is often accompanied by local and systemic signs and symptoms in about two-thirds of infants.​[^[5]]​[^[6]] The most common symptoms are gingival irritation (87%), irritability (68%) and drooling (56%).​[^[7]] Other reported symptoms include a decrease in appetite for solid food, an increase in thirst, a mild increase in body temperature (up to 37.7°C),​[^[8]] loose stools, ear rubbing and nasal congestion.​[^[6]] Symptoms may appear up to 4 days prior to the emergence of the tooth. The peak in incidence and severity of symptoms is usually on the day of tooth eruption or 1 or 2 days before. These symptoms generally resolve within 3 days after tooth eruption.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

For a few days prior to eruption, the gum overlying the tooth may show signs of inflammation such as redness, irritation, swelling and tenderness. The child may have a greater tendency to rub the gum by biting their fingers, lips, toys or some other object. This action induces more salivation and drooling, which can cause some facial irritation or skin rash. The local inflammation may be sufficient to explain the irritability of the child, which may manifest as agitation, restlessness, crying and insomnia.​[^[7]]

Symptoms associated with an erupting tooth may coincide with an infectious process. Do not overlook the possibility of infection, particularly when more severe symptoms are present. Fever, diarrhea, vomiting or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection require assessment; do not presume they are caused by teething.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

#### Permanent Teeth, Pericoronitis and Pericoronal Abscess

The eruption of a permanent tooth may be associated with the same gingival manifestations as with primary teeth, but the symptoms are usually much less pronounced. There may be local inflammation on the gum over and around the erupting tooth, from a few days prior to emergence of the tooth to a few days after tooth eruption.​[^[9]] Part of the gingiva may overlie a portion of the surface of the tooth (usually distal) for a relatively long period of time before completely receding, particularly around the second molars. This part of the mucosa is called the operculum. Usually no symptoms result from its presence, but it can be problematic in the presence of mechanical trauma or plaque, particularly around the third molars.

Severe inflammation and marked swelling of the operculum is called pericoronitis and is most often seen in teenagers and young adults. The patient may present with localized or diffuse pain, swelling and/or trauma at the operculum, bad breath and a foul taste in the mouth. When pus is present, the condition is called pericoronal abscess, and immediate dental or medical attention is recommended because the infection may spread into the oropharyngeal area and medially to the base of the tongue.​[^[10]] Swelling may extend to the adjacent tissue, and the patient may experience limitation in opening the mouth, lymphadenopathy and low-grade fever.​[^[6]]​[^[9]]

#### Delayed Tooth Eruption

There is a wide range in eruption times of primary and permanent teeth, due to individual variation (see Table 2). Developmental age is more important than chronological age in assessing delays in tooth eruption. In an otherwise healthy child, a delay of up to 6 months if a primary tooth is involved or up to 12 months in the case of a permanent tooth is usually of no clinical significance.​[^[11]]​[^[12]] Delays can be caused by local factors such as the presence of a neighbouring tooth in the erupting path, insufficient space in the arch or a dental infection. Rarely, systemic conditions or iatrogenic factors such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy of the head and neck can delay tooth eruption. Table 2 summarizes the possible causes of delayed tooth eruption. Table 3 contains guidance on when to refer patients to a dentist.

| Systemic Causes (infrequent) | Local Causes | Iatrogenic Causes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Down syndromeCleidocranial dysplasiaCongenital hypopituitarismCongenital hypothyroidismEctodermal dysplasiaGaucher diseaseOsteopetrosisVitamin D deficiency | Ankylosis of the predecessor toothCystsLack of arch spacePremature loss of the predecessor toothSupernumerary teeth (extra teeth) | ChemotherapyRadiotherapy of the head and neck |


#### Eruption Cysts

Occasionally, a localized, dome-shaped, fluctuant, bluish, swollen area, sometimes surrounded by inflammation, appears on the gum overlying the crown of an erupting tooth. The space is filled with tissue, fluid and blood. This condition is called an eruption cyst and is more often seen over erupting molars. Eruption cysts are usually encountered in the first and second decades of life, and there is no gender predilection.​[^[15]] See Photo, Eruption Cyst.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows an intraoral view of a child's mouth. The following details are observed:

1. **Teeth**: The primary (baby) teeth are visible. There is a noticeable gap where a tooth is missing, likely due to natural exfoliation or extraction.

2. **Gingiva**: The gums appear generally healthy, though there is a prominent swelling or lesion on the upper gum area.

3. **Lesion**: A large, translucent, fluid-filled blister or cyst is present on the upper gum, above the missing tooth area. This could be indicative of a dental cyst or eruption cyst, commonly seen in children.

4. **Surrounding Tissue**: The surrounding oral mucosa appears normal, with no signs of inflammation or infection.

5. **Dental Arch**: The alignment of the teeth suggests a mixed dentition stage, typical in children transitioning from primary to permanent teeth.

This image likely represents a clinical case involving a dental cyst or similar condition, requiring further evaluation by a dental professional.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Table 3 lists circumstances in which referral to a dentist or physician is indicated.

| Condition | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Pericoronitis | Dental consultation as soon as possible |
| Pericoronal abscess | Urgent dental or medical consultation |
| Delays of over 6 months in a primary tooth eruption or 12 months in a permanent tooth eruption | Dental consultation as soon as possible |
| Suspected systemic illness in a young child, e.g., fever, vomiting, diarrhea, symptoms of upper respiratory infection | Medical consultation when appropriate (these symptoms are not normally associated with teething) |
| Eruption cysts that do not spontaneously drain or that cause discomfort and/or interfere with feeding | Dental consultation as soon as possible |


#### Treatment of Teething Pain

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

| Recommended | Not Recommended |
| --- | --- |
| Child may chew/bite on cooled teether or frozen face cloth | Liquid filled teethers, or those with small parts that can break off and cause child to choke​[16] |
| Rub back of small, cold spoon on gum​[1] | Long-term contact with very cold items |
|  | Teething biscuits due to high sugar content |
|  | Teething necklaces due to lack of clinical support and significant risk of strangulation​[17]​[18]​[19] |


#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics; Dental Products: Topical Analgesics for Teething. 

For teething pain in infants that is not relieved by nonpharmacologic measures, oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be used at the usual analgesic doses (see Table 5).​[^[1]] If pain is uncontrolled with either agent, alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen, staggering the doses every 3 hours, may be considered, although there is limited evidence to support safety and efficacy of this practice.​[^[20]] Systemic analgesics should never be rubbed on the gum.

Topical anesthetic agents (benzocaine 7.5–10% in a gel formulation) are available, but are no longer authorized for use in children under 2 years of age.​[^[21]] They are not recommended by the Canadian Dental Association and Health Canada due to risk of methemoglobinemia, an uncommon but serious adverse effect that has been reported with the use of benzocaine applied to the oral mucosa.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]] This condition affects oxygen delivery to tissues and is characterized by bluish discoloration of the skin, nausea, and fatigue, and can progress to stupor, coma, and death. There is also risk of disabling the gag reflex if the child swallows the anesthetic.

#### Treatment of Pericoronitis or Pericoronal Abscess

Pericoronitis and pericoronal abscess require a dental consultation for appropriate treatment. Analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) may be used to control pain and decrease fever when present. The patient may be instructed to rinse at home with lukewarm salt water (about one-half teaspoon of table salt in a cup of warm water) every 2–3 hours for 2–3 days.​[^[24]]

 Pericoronitis or pericoronal abscess can be treated by the dentist with careful débridement of the area with curettage, followed by irrigation with **saline (0.9% NaCl)** solution, chlorhexidine **0.12%** solution or hydrogen peroxide **3%**. Some cases require surgical removal of the operculum, extraction of the involved tooth, or extraction or selective grinding of the opposing tooth.​[^[24]]

When systemic manifestations (e.g., fever) or extensive swelling are present, an antibacterial agent targeting oral anaerobes (e.g., amoxicillin or metronidazole) is usually prescribed along with irrigation and surgical intervention if necessary.​[^[24]]​[^[25]]​[^[26]] Clindamycin is no longer recommended as a first-line option in penicillin-allergic patients due to increased risk of Clostridiodes difficile infections and limited efficacy in odontogenic infections.​[^[24]]​[^[27]]​[^[28]]

For more information regarding drug therapy for dental conditions, see Dental Conditions, Table 1 and Table 2.

#### Treatment of Eruption Cysts

Eruption cysts usually rupture spontaneously. In rare cases, marsupialization (surgical excision of a small amount of gum tissue from the roof of the cyst) under local anesthesia may be indicated if significant discomfort or interference with feeding occurs.​[^[1]]​[^[13]]​[^[15]]
