**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart designed to assist in diagnosing foot conditions. Here is a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Start Point:**
   - "Patient with foot condition"

2. **Initial Inspection:**
   - Inspect the general appearance of the foot with emphasis on:
     - Skin rashes, lesions, color, sensation, temperature, odor, pedal pulses
     - Signs of inflammation, pain, itching, burning, swelling, discharge
   - Consider using "Inlow's 60-second Diabetic Foot Screen."

3. **Decision Points and Outcomes:**

   - **Pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe, gradual formation of bone deformity, and great toe deviated towards other toes?**
     - **Yes:** Bunion
     - **No:** Proceed to next decision point

   - **Relatively sudden onset of pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe, and erythematous/hot great toe, or pain/inflammation under the first metatarsal?**
     - **Yes:** Possible gout, psoriatic arthritis, or sesamoiditis
     - **No:** Proceed to next decision point

   - **Thick/damaged toenail or edge of the surrounding soft tissue is red, swollen, and painful?**
     - **Yes:** Ingrown toenail, onychomycosis, or paronychia
     - **No:** Proceed to next decision point

   - **Hyperkeratosis (skin ridges may or may not be preserved), burning sensation, pain, or aching in the feet?**
     - **Yes:** Corn or callus
     - **No:** Proceed to next decision point

   - **Localized hyperkeratosis, skin ridges disrupted, painless (sometimes painful when pushed on, as when walking), black dots in center of lesion?**
     - **Yes:** Plantar wart
     - **No:** Proceed to next decision point

   - **Cracking, itchy, moist, white, scaly lesions or sores between the toes? May also be dry, scaly, reddish skin (moccasin-type infection)**
     - **Yes:** Possible athlete’s foot
     - **No:** Refer to an appropriate health-care practitioner when needed for confirmation of diagnosis and management

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Other foot conditions to consider include:
     - Achilles tendinitis, bacterial infections, chilblains, contact dermatitis, dry skin, eczema, foot arch pain/strain, fractures, hammer toes, hyperhidrosis, neuropathy, osteoarthritis, overpronation, plantar fasciitis, rheumatoid arthritis, sprains, spurs

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing common foot conditions based on symptoms and physical examination findings.

#### Introduction

Foot health is often overlooked, and inattention to signs and symptoms may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of a medical condition, which may have an impact on the quality of life. In each foot there are 26 bones, more than 100 tendons, muscles and ligaments and 33 joints.​[^[17]] When individuals present with foot concerns, it is important to complete a thorough patient history and clinical examination of the feet using standard, validated tools. A suggested process for assessing foot symptoms is shown in Figure 1. Upon completion of an assessment, a risk level can be established and a time interval between subsequent assessments can be determined. In particular, for those with diabetes at the lowest risk level, a once yearly foot assessment is appropriate.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]
