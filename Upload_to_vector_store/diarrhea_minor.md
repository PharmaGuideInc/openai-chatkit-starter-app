#### Introduction

Diarrhea is the unusually frequent excretion of watery stools. It is associated with loss of electrolytes and loss of fecal matter at a rate of >200 g/24 hours.​[^[1]] A more practical working definition is ≥3 loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based on an individual baseline.​[^[2]] Decreased fluid absorption or increased fluid secretion can lead to dehydration, which can ultimately lead to death, particularly in children and the elderly.

Although temporal definitions vary, diarrhea can be classified as acute (<14 days in duration), persistent (>14 days in duration) or chronic (>28 days in duration).​[^[3]]​[^[4]]

Diarrhea is believed to be underreported.​[^[5]] The incidence of acute diarrhea in industrialized countries is approximately 0.5–2 episodes per person yearly and considerably higher in developing and underdeveloped countries.​[^[6]] In older children, adolescents and adults, diarrhea accounts for about 2.8 billion episodes annually worldwide.​[^[7]] Diarrhea is common in the pediatric population; statistics indicate that children <5 years experience 1.3–2.7 episodes of diarrhea yearly.​[^[8]] Eighteen percent of all deaths in children under 5 years of age are attributed to diarrhea and 78% of those deaths occur in African and Southeast Asian regions. In this age group, diarrhea is the second-leading cause of death, following pneumonia.​[^[9]] As a result, the integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea hopes to reduce death from diarrhea in children under 5 years of age to <1 in 1000 by 2025.​[^[10]]

Aside from dehydration, complications of diarrhea include electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, vascular collapse, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse. Diarrhea often results in a decreased ability to perform daily activities. 

#### Pathophysiology

Chronic diarrhea is often indicative of a disorder of the brain-gut axis, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal diseases with underlying inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) are also prevalent. Food intolerances and sensitivities, ischemic colitis, microscopic colitis, GI infections, radiation or chemotherapy, and maldigestion or malabsorption of fat or carbohydrates (celiac disease, lactose intolerance) can also be responsible for chronic diarrhea. Foods that contain large amounts of sorbitol or mannitol can cause osmotic diarrhea.​[^[11]]

The most common cause of acute diarrhea is viral infection.​[^[12]] Acute childhood diarrheal pathogens are transmitted by close contact and in particular the oral-fecal route. Child-care settings are a common place for acquiring infectious diarrhea where typical infectious viral agents include:​[^[11]]



Bacteria and less commonly parasites (e.g., Giardia) are also implicated in causing diarrhea. When bacteria are involved, it may be due to strains such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella or Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli. The symptoms accompanying a bacterial infection are generally more severe than a viral infection, i.e., bloody stools, fever. 

Drugs are also a common cause of diarrhea (see Table 1). In particular, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and erythromycins are implicated in altering the bacterial flora of the gut, resulting in diarrhea. This usually occurs 2–3 days after starting the antibiotic and resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. An uncommon but potentially serious result of antibiotics use is Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea. While antibiotic use is not a prerequisite to C. difficile–associated diarrhea, it is the most common cause. The agents most often implicated are clindamycin, ampicillin and the cephalosporins,​[^[14]] although any antimicrobial agent can cause it, including those used to treat it. The condition can occur in anyone who has received an antibiotic within the previous 3 months and is characterized by significant loss of fluid, fever and abdominal pain. C. difficile infections necessitate treatment; refer to *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Diarrhea for further discussion.

Other causes of diarrhea include nervousness or anxiety, gastrointestinal or pancreatic tumours, diabetes mellitus, opioid withdrawal, rapid increase of fibre in the diet, enteral nutritional supplements, deficiencies of specific nutrients such as vitamin A and zinc,​[^[18]] excesses of specific nutrients such as vitamin C and magnesium,​[^[1]]​[^[11]] certain metals, organic toxins and plant products (e.g., arsenic, insecticides, mushroom toxins, caffeine).​[^[19]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

For patients presenting with diarrhea, a thorough patient history may be helpful in elucidating the underlying cause. This can include an inquiry regarding travel and animal exposure, sources of water (e.g., well water), recent food consumption, history of past diarrheal episodes, recent antibiotic use, medical conditions (e.g., immunocompromised) and time spent in long-term care or day-care facilities.​[^[20]] 

Aside from frequent loose stools, symptoms of infectious diarrhea may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills and malaise. Presence of red flags (see Table 2) requires further detailed patient assessment. A physical exam will aid in assessing the degree of dehydration (see Table 3). Decreased skin turgor becomes evident in moderate to severe dehydration (see Figure 1).

Question patients with repeated episodes of diarrhea about any relationship between symptoms and consumption of dairy or grain products to rule out lactose or gluten intolerance (see Special Diets).

**AI Image Description:**
The image consists of two illustrations demonstrating a skin turgor test, which is used to assess hydration status.

1. **Left Illustration:**
   - A hand is pinching the skin on the forearm of another person.
   - The pinched skin is elevated, indicating the action of pinching.

2. **Right Illustration:**
   - The hand has released the skin.
   - The skin remains slightly elevated and is flattening slowly.

**Text Below the Illustrations:**
- "When pinched and released, the skin flattens slowly"

This suggests that the skin's slow return to its normal position may indicate dehydration or reduced skin elasticity.

An assessment and management plan for patients suffering from diarrhea not related to travel is illustrated in Figure 2.

#### Prevention

#### Nonpharmacologic Preventative Measures



#### Pharmacologic Preventative Measures

Two vaccines are available to protect against rotavirus infection (see Table 8).​[^[26]]​[^[27]]

Probiotics are live microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) that exert a beneficial effect by improving the balance of the host's intestinal flora.​[^[28]]​[^[29]] Most probiotics appear relatively safe,​[^[30]] but should be used cautiously in patients who are immunosuppressed or have a badly damaged GI tract.​[^[28]] There are few well-designed clinical trials of the use of probiotics to prevent or treat diarrhea; however, some probiotic strains and products may provide some benefit:



Despite this heterogeneity, the overall evidence suggests there may be a protective effect of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.​[^[31]] Products may contain microorganisms not listed on the label or contain quantities of microorganisms other than that listed.​[^[52]] Product standardization can also be a problem. As a result, the health benefits of one strain cannot be extrapolated to probiotics in general, particularly those of unknown strain composition. A clinical guide to probiotic products in Canada is available at www.probioticchart.ca.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Oral Rehydration Products.

Rehydration and maintaining electrolyte balance are the cornerstones of therapy for diarrhea.​[^[53]] Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) can treat the majority of patients with diarrhea as well as prevent most diarrhea-related complications.​[^[8]] Oral rehydration solution (ORS) utilizes the sodium/glucose–coupled absorption mechanism in the small intestine.​[^[54]] ORS is composed of sodium and glucose in the concentration and osmolarity of the luminal fluid. It is recommended by the WHO and should be used early, particularly when treating children and the elderly. Diarrhea is the second-leading cause of child deaths with 1.9 million children dying yearly, mainly from dehydration.​[^[55]] The WHO along with UNICEF currently advocate the use of a new ORS formulation that has a decreased osmolarity of 245 mOsm/L compared with an osmolarity of 311 mOsm/L in the previous formulation. This new formulation was recommended in 2002 and has decreased concentrations of glucose and sodium chloride. Studies have shown that a reduced-osmolarity solution decreases stool output by 20%, reduces vomiting by 30% and decreases the need for IV therapy by about 30%.​[^[56]]​[^[57]] The WHO formula for ORS is presented in Table 4 as are those of the commercially available Gastrolyte, Pedialyte and Hydralyte.​[^[58]]​[^[59]] It should be noted that liquid Hydralyte can be stored in the refrigerator for 30 days once opened compared with 24 and 48 hours for Gastrolyte and Pedialyte, respectively. Home­made ORS can also be used although this is discouraged because mixing errors often occur. Examples of homemade ORS recipes are described in Table 5.

ORT is contraindicated in the following instances:​[^[60]]



Rapid refeeding with age-appropriate foods should immediately follow rehydration.​[^[53]] Withholding food for bowel rest, formula dilution and systematic elimination of lactose are no longer standard recommendations.

| Component | WHO | Gastrolyte | Pedialyte​[a] | Hydralyte |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sodium (mmol/L) | 75 | 60 | 45 | 45 |

| Recipe #2 | Purified waterSaltSugar | 1 L (4 and one-quarter cups)2.5 mL (one-half teaspoonful)30 mL (6 teaspoonfuls) |


#### Children

In most cases, diarrhea in children is self-limiting and non-life-threatening. However, this population can be more susceptible to the adverse consequences of dehydration and should be monitored closely.

The treatment of childhood diarrhea focuses on correcting dehydration with ORT. Commercial oral rehydration solutions are readily available, effective and safe, but they are often underutilized.​[^[12]]​[^[53]] Under­utilization may be due to the inconvenience of administration, unacceptable taste or a preference for IV versus oral rehydration. While fruit juices have not traditionally been recommended for rehydration due to concerns they may cause osmotic diarrhea, there is evidence that oral rehydration with half-diluted apple juice followed by preferred fluids can be considered for children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.​[^[63]]

Breastfeeding should be continued during episodes of diarrhea,​[^[20]]​[^[53]] and ORS should be offered. If a child is not being breastfed, age-appropriate foods should be given as well as ORS as described in Table 6. ORT should start as soon as diarrhea begins and continue until diarrhea is less frequent.

| Age of Child | Amount of Oral Rehydration Solution to Give​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| 0–6 months | 30–90 mL every hour |
| 6–24 months | 90–125 mL every hour |
| >2 y | 125–250 mL every hour |


Even if a child refuses ORS by the cup or bottle, the solution is to be given by a medicine dropper or small teaspoon. If vomiting occurs, ORS should be continued with a spoon, giving 15 mL every 10–15 minutes until vomiting stops, then resuming with the regular amount (see Table 6). If vomiting does not stop after 4–6 hours, the child should undergo further assessment.

Early refeeding should begin within 6 hours of beginning ORS. For infants who are formula-fed, start with small, frequent feedings of the child's usual formula. If the diarrhea persists for 2 days, switch to a soy-based or lactose-free formula as lactose intolerance may be suspected.​[^[60]]

For older children, early refeeding with age-appropriate, previously tolerated foods is recommended.​[^[53]]​[^[60]] After 24–48 hours, the child's normal diet can resume. It may take 7–10 days for stools to become completely formed. Restricting a child to a complex carbohydrate diet (e.g., BRATT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, tea and toast) is inappropriate.​[^[65]]

For dehydrating, persistent diarrhea, the use of hypo-osmolar ORS (e.g., the new WHO ORS, Gastrolyte, Pedialyte, Hydralyte) is beneficial and superior to the older iso-osmolar WHO ORS (see Table 4).​[^[66]] Hypo-osmolar ORS results in a shorter period of diarrhea, less stool output and less need for maintenance therapy.

In addition to hypo-osmolar ORS, the WHO and UNICEF recommend supplementation with zinc 20 mg daily for 10–14 days for infants >6 months of age and 10 mg per day for infants <6 months of age. Zinc supplementation decreases both the severity and the duration of acute or persistent diarrhea in children.​[^[67]]​[^[68]]​[^[69]] Supplementing with a combination of micronutrients and vitamins is not superior to zinc alone.​[^[70]] The addition of zinc and prebiotics to ORS limits the duration of diarrhea in children.​[^[71]]

In 2015, a flocked swab for rectal use was developed as a point-of-care tool to quickly and effectively determine whether certain antibiotics would be useful in treating pathogens that cause diarrhea in infants and children in developing countries.​[^[72]] They discovered that, in a third of the children in the study, there was a treatable pathogen present, yet stools contained no blood. Early treatment may decrease the permanent damage (i.e., cognitive delay, stunted growth, decreased productivity in adulthood or death) that can be caused by infection. Their place in therapy in Canada is yet to be determined.

There are also studies emerging for candidate vaccines against Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. that show promise in improving the burden of enteric infections in children.​[^[73]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Antidiarrheal medications are indicated for relief of debilitating symptoms that accompany diarrheal illness. Select agents useful in the management of diarrhea are described in Table 9.

For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for diarrhea, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Diarrhea.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antidiarrheals.

Other pharmacologic therapies for diarrhea include:



#### Pregnancy

Acute diarrhea in pregnancy is mainly due to viral or bacterial causes and is usually self-limiting. Maintenance of fluid intake is important. **Bulking agents** may be of use, and systemic agents such as loperamide should be reserved for severe cases when the risk of dehydration outweighs the risk of the drug used.​[^[79]]

#### Elderly

The elderly are particularly susceptible to dehydration due to diarrhea. Nursing homes are similar to child-care settings where pathogens are spread by the oral-fecal route. Prompt rehydration is essential to avoid damage to vital organs.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 7 provides a monitoring plan framework that should be individualized.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loose, watery stools | Patient: regularly as long as symptoms persist.Health-care practitioner: ask for symptom report; call patient within 48 h to see if symptoms have resolved. | Resolution of symptoms. Return to usual bowel evacuation pattern. | Antidiarrheal medications may be necessary within first 2 days to alleviate symptoms. If symptoms persist beyond 48 h, seek medical attention. |
| Signs and symptoms of dehydration (see Table 3) | Patient: continually. | No signs of dehydration. | If signs of dehydration (see Table 3 and Figure 1) occur despite oral rehydration therapy, reassess. |
| Fever or blood in stools | Patient: regularly as long as symptoms persist. | No fever; no blood in stools. | Reassess if this occurs. |


#### Algorithms

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for managing a patient experiencing diarrhea. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The process begins with the patient experiencing diarrhea.
   - The first decision point asks: "Any red flags? (See Table 2)"

2. **Red Flags Present:**
   - If "Yes," the recommendation is "Oral rehydration therapy. Further assessment required."

3. **No Red Flags:**
   - If "No," proceed to "Oral rehydration therapy ± loperamide (moderate-severe diarrhea) or bismuth subsalicylate (mild-moderate diarrhea) or attapulgite (mild diarrhea) or psyllium (mild diarrhea)."

4. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
   - The next decision point asks: "Diarrhea improves within 48 h?"
     - If "Yes," the recommendation is to "Continue oral rehydration therapy until diarrhea stops. Consider stopping antidiarrheal medication when diarrhea resolves."
     - If "No," the next step is to "Try loperamide for 24 h (if has not been tried already)."

5. **Resolution Check:**
   - The final decision point asks: "Diarrhea resolves?"
     - If "Yes," the process ends.
     - If "No," return to "Oral rehydration therapy. Further assessment required."

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing diarrhea, emphasizing rehydration and the use of specific medications based on the severity of symptoms.
