#### Introduction

Radiation and systemic cancer therapy can be highly toxic and may confer side effects normally considered unacceptable in the treatment of other diseases. Furthermore, patients with cancer are now living long enough for unique, delayed side effects to manifest. 

Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs exploit this difference by affecting fast-growing, highly proliferative cells during replication, therefore killing more cancer cells than normal cells. Hematopoietic cells, the skin and its appendages, and the epithelium of the intestine are also highly proliferative; thus, they are susceptible to toxicity from chemotherapy. 

Increased understanding of the human genome and the drivers of cancer growth have led to the development of many targeted cancer therapies. Unlike conventional chemotherapy agents, which affect both cancer cells and normal cells, targeted therapies inhibit specific cellular processes upon which the particular cancer cell is dependent for growth. Although this means there are less of the toxicities usually associated with conventional chemotherapy, there are unique and unexpected toxicities that can arise because the targeted processes may exist in some normal tissues as well. Targeted therapies have replaced conventional chemotherapy as standard treatment in some cancers (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia), are used in conjunction with conventional treatment (e.g., in breast cancer) and are options when standard therapies fail (e.g., thyroid cancer). Targeted therapies are typically monoclonal antibodies or their structural derivatives or small molecule inhibitors.

With pharmacologic cancer therapies, most side effects occur upon exposure and generally resolve over time once therapy is completed. In contrast, any organ that is exposed to radiation can develop early toxicities (within days to months) or delayed toxicities (within months to years). Radiation is delivered locally; thus, toxicities usually occur locally. Global toxicities such as myelosuppression are typically rare unless the patient undergoes total body irradiation. X-rays travel through the tissues from an entry point into the body to an exit point out of the body. Toxicities can occur throughout this area. The degree of toxicity is dependent on the area irradiated and the type of radiation therapy that is used.

This chapter’s focus is on select toxicities of radiation and pharmacologic cancer therapy that are predictable and preventable in onset or severity. While pediatric management is generally the same, the focus is the adult patient. Table 1 lists common pharmacologic cancer therapy classes. Table 2 and Table 3 provide information on the prevention and management of toxicities of pharmacologic cancer therapies and radiation therapy, respectively. Table 4 contains more detailed information on the pharmacologic therapies used to prevent and manage these toxicities.

#### Prevention and Management of Select Toxicities of Cancer Therapies

| Toxicity/Organ Involved (time frame to onset) | Classes/Drugs Commonly Implicated​[a] | Prevention | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiac |  |  |  |
| Arterial thromboembolism (angina, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, stroke)(within days to weeks) | VEGF inhibitors | Identify and manage risk factors for myocardial and cerebral infarction and ischemia. See Acute Coronary Syndromes, Prevention of Ischemic Stroke and Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease. | Manage risk factors with consideration of the patient’s clinical status and prognosis. VEGF inhibitors are usually discontinued if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs. |
| Coronary vasospasm and myocardial ischemia (within hours to days) | Fluoropyrimidines | Initiate cautiously in patients with coronary artery disease. Aggressive control of modifiable risk factors is important during and after treatment. Avoid in patients with severe or unstable conditions.​[5] | **nitrates** |
| Heart failure(within months to years) | HER2 inhibitors (highest with trastuzumab), VEGF inhibitors, multikinase inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, osimertinib | Routine cardiac monitoring for all patients receiving trastuzumab.​[7] Avoid simultaneous administration with other cardiotoxic chemotherapies.​[5]​[8] For other agents, more frequent cardiac monitoring if cardiac risk factors present, which continues into survivorship.​[7]​[9] | For HER2 therapies, interruption of therapy for asymptomatic reductions in ejection fraction. Treatment can be restarted in many patients. Discontinuation usually recommended if clinically symptomatic or if interruptions are required multiple times despite optimization of cardiac management.​[5]​[8] Standard management of left ventricular dysfunction with ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or beta-blockers. A similar approach can be used with VEGF inhibitors.​[5]​[9] See Heart Failure. |
| Anthracyclines | Limit lifelong cumulative doses to below predefined safe thresholds.​[10] Regimens with longer infusion times (>6 h) may have lower risk.​[11] Prophylaxis with statins, beta-blockers and/or ARBs are under prospective evaluation, having shown some trends for benefit.​[5]​[12]Liposomal formulations of anthracyclines reduce the risk but may not be a valid substitute in every indication.Dexrazoxane is used in certain patients (e.g., those with metastatic disease) whose lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose exceeds safe thresholds or who have underlying cardiac risk factors. Assess cardiac function periodically.​[5]​[9] | Clinically indistinguishable from heart failure due to other causes. Treat symptomatically.​[9] See Heart Failure. |  |
| Hypertension(within weeks to months) | VEGF inhibitors, multikinase small molecule inhibitors | Identify and manage risk factors for hypertension. Monitor blood pressure with every cycle of treatment with expectation of blood pressure elevations within the first few cycles of therapy.​[5] | Manage blood pressure aggressively but with consideration to the patient’s clinical status and prognosis. See Hypertension. |
| QTc prolongation(possible torsades de pointes arrhythmia)(within days to weeks) | Many small molecule kinase inhibitors | Initiate cautiously in patients with risk factors (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome, heart failure, electrolyte imbalances).​[5] Dose reductions based on QTc are recommended for some drugs. Avoid unnecessary use of multiple drugs with additive risk of QTc prolongation.​[13] | If benefit of using the drug outweighs risk, monitor and resolve risk factors; perform baseline ECG and monitor frequently. Evaluate need for dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation when QTc interval exceeds 450–500 msec or ≥60 msec above baseline.​[5] |
| Venous thromboembolic events(deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)(within weeks to months) | Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​[b] bevacizumab, tamoxifen, sunitinib, thalidomide analogues | **ASA** | Low molecular weight heparins and DOACs (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) preferred for long-term anticoagulation.​[5]​[14] Vitamin K antagonists should be used with caution and only if alternatives are not accessible, as cancer patients are susceptible to wide fluctuations in INR. See Venous Thromboembolism. |
| Dermatologic |  |  |  |
| Alopecia(partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body)(within weeks to months) | Many, but not all, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​[b] depending on the dose and the regimen used | To delay or minimize hair loss, treat hair gently by using mild shampoos and soft hairbrushes, and avoiding harsh chemicals and high heat settings on hair dryer (see Hair Care and Hair Growth). Evidence for effectiveness of scalp cooling in delaying hair loss and promoting hair recovery is increasing but tolerability of scalp cooling, high cost and product variability hinders wide acceptance.​[15]​[16] | Degree and location of hair loss is dependent on the individual, the combination of drugs used, and the dose and scheduling of the treatment. Cosmetic intervention using wigs, hats or scarves. Treat underlying causes (e.g., inflammation or dermatitis) and deficiencies (e.g., nutrient deficiency), if present. Observational data suggests minoxidil 2% or 5% has benefit in possibly reducing the severity and/or duration of alopecia induced by treatment.​[17]​[18] |
| Extravasation(leakage from IV line into surrounding tissues resulting in tissue inflammation and necrosis)(during infusion to days) | Anthracyclines, antitumor antibiotics, mechlorethamine, platinums, taxanes, vinca alkaloids | Insertion of needle cannula must follow standardized protocols to reduce the risk of extravasation (e.g., careful selection of IV site, ensuring blood return and fluid flow). Use of a central venous catheter should be considered for high-risk drugs that have prolonged infusion times. The site should be monitored throughout chemotherapy treatment.​[19] | **dimethyl sulfoxide** |
| Hand-foot syndrome (HFS)(skin discolouration, edema, pain, peeling of skin on fingers and toes)(within weeks to months) | Capecitabine, fluorouracil, liposomal doxorubicin | **Vitamin B6** | **analgesics** |
| Hand-foot-skin reaction (HFSR)(skin discolouration, edema, pain, peeling of skin on fingers and toes, hyperkeratosis at pressure points)(within weeks to months) | BRAF inhibitors, multikinase VEGF inhibitors | Apply moisturizers frequently (at least TID) and avoid extremes of temperature. Urea-based emollients may be preferred.​[23] Avoid irritation and friction from ill-fitting shoes and clothing. Limit prolonged pressure to weight-bearing areas and treat existing calluses and hyperkeratosis.​[24]​[25] | **analgesics** |
| Pruritus(within weeks to months) | Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies,​[b] checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors | See Pruritus. | Management of pruritus is empirical and supported by few treatment-specific studies (see Pruritus). While pruritus usually accompanies rash and can be managed based on rash severity (see Rash, immune-related), the presentation of pruritus without overt skin damage has been reported. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced pruritus has to be managed with additional considerations: i) the immunosuppressants used in pruritus (e.g., azathioprine) may potentially counteract the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors and should be avoided, ii) high-dose PO or IV corticosteroids are required for severe pruritus. |
| Rash, immune-related(local or diffuse rash with or without pruritus)(within weeks) | BiTEs, CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors | No known prophylaxis measures. | **corticosteroids** |
| Rash related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition(acne-like papules on the head, face, upper chest and back)(within weeks) | Cetuximab, osimertinib, panitumumab, possibly ibrutinib, EGFR directed monoclonal antibodies, EGFR small molecule inhibitors | **corticosteroids** | **moisturizers** |
| Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat (EENT) |  |  |  |
| Conjunctivitis (within days) | Anthracyclines, cytarabine (doses >2 g/m​2), fluoropyrimidines | **prednisolone** | **analgesics** |
| Lacrimal obstruction and excessive tearing(within months) | Docetaxel (most frequently with weekly schedules of docetaxel) | No proven preventative measures. | Mild symptoms can be managed via supportive measures by reducing eye irritation. Educate patients that excess tearing is due to poor drainage, not excess tear development. Reduction of underlying causes such as dry eyes, allergy symptoms and physical irritation may reduce tear production. Moderate or severe symptoms will require an ophthalmologist consult for possible bilateral stent insertion into the canalicular ducts.​[32] |
| Ocular toxicity(retinopathy, iritis, uveitis and others)(weeks to months) | BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, erdafitinib | Baseline assessment to allow for proper assessment of ongoing visual changes. | Management is based on the specific drug, and can include dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation depending on the drug and the toxicity. Ophthalmology and optometry should be involved for ongoing management.​[33] |
| Ototoxicity (within weeks to months) | Platinums | Audiograms every 3–4 cycles, especially in patients at risk (pre-existing hearing loss, chronic noise exposure, high cumulative doses of cisplatin).​[34] | Can be irreversible. Reduce doses or change treatment if possible. |
| Gastrointestinal |  |  |  |
| Cholinergic syndrome and acute diarrhea (abdominal cramps, flushing, miosis, lacrimation, rhinitis)(during infusion to hours) | Irinotecan | Reduce the rate of infusion. Avoid regimens that use high doses of irinotecan. Educate patient to report symptoms immediately so that treatment can be initiated.​[35] | **atropine** |
| Constipation (within weeks to months ) | Vinca alkaloids, platinums | While vinca alkaloids and platinums are reported to cause constipation, the most common cause of chemotherapy-associated constipation is due to the use of 5-HT3 antagonist antiemetics. See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting. Patient education, risk factor assessment and preventive measures should be considered in patients with pre-existing constipation at baseline (e.g., laxatives).​[37] | Laxatives and nonpharmacologic measures typically used for constipation (see Constipation in Adults). Suppositories and enemas are used with prolonged, severe constipation, but they may introduce an infection risk in neutropenic patients. Educate patient to discontinue laxatives before the onset of cancer therapy-induced diarrhea.​[37] |
| Diarrhea, immune-related(diarrhea and symptoms of colitis: blood in stool, abdominal pain, urgency to defecate)(within weeks to months) | BiTEs, CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors | No known prophylaxis measures. | **loperamide** |
| Diarrhea, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced (within days to weeks) | All traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have some risk, usually dose-related | Educate patient on nonpharmacologic management, avoidance of potential triggers and careful monitoring. It is important to treat diarrhea before it progresses in severity. Patients starting traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy at high risk for diarrhea should have antidiarrheal medications on hand. See Diarrhea. | **octreotide** |
| Mucositis(general, painful erythema or localized lesions)(within days to weeks) | Most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies; severity varies with agent and individualMany targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized classes at higher risk are mTOR inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, BCL inhibitors | Maintain regular oral hygiene regimen, use soft bristled toothbrush. Avoid flossing if gums bleed. Avoid hard or sharp-textured foods.Cryotherapy (ice chips) prevents mucositis or reduces its severity in patients receiving bolus treatments of fluorouracil or high-dose melphalan. Ice and other cold foods are contraindicated with oxaliplatin-containing regimens (e.g., FOLFOX).Dexamethasone oral rinses for the first 2–4 cycles of everolimus treatment reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis.​[40]Evidence supports the use of low-level laser therapy to prevent mucositis in stem cell transplant settings, but it is used in limited centres due to challenges with access. Employ nonpharmacologic measures: basic oral hygiene and the use of a clean, soft-bristle toothbrush that is replaced on a regular basis, judicious flossing and the use of bland mouthwashes such as baking soda and/or salt rinses or alcohol-free mouthwashes.​[41]For persistent oral thrush complications of mucositis, see Table 3, Candidiasis (oral) | **analgesics** |
| Nausea and vomiting (during infusion and within days) |  | See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting. |  |
| Hematologic |  |  |  |
| Anemia (within weeks to months) | Most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies;​[b] severity varies with agent and individual | No proven preventive measures. Assess for and correct underlying nutritional anemia (e.g., folic acid, iron, vitamin B12) prior to cancer treatment. Erythropoietics should not be used prophylactically.​[45] Maintain a high suspicion for functional iron deficiency. Unlike true/absolute iron deficiency, functional iron deficiency is a product of poor iron mobilization and transport instead of inadequate stores of iron.​[46]​[47] | **epoetin alfa** |
| Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia(most traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies​[b] will cause neutropenia; the risk of febrile neutropenia is the greater concern)(within days to weeks) | Varies with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agent, regimen and individual risk factorsMany targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized class at higher risk are the CDK 4/6 inhibitors | **pegfilgrastim** | Rapid recognition and response to potential infection required. Standard management of febrile neutropenia includes empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, clinical assessment and supportive care. See Infections in the Cancer Patient. |
| Thrombocytopenia (within weeks to months) | Occurs rarely with many traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies; severity varies with agent and individualMany targeted agents (also varies with agent and individual) Recognized class at higher risk are the CDK 4/6 inhibitors | No proven preventive measures. | Platelet transfusions are the mainstay of treatment for severe thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy. |
| Immunologic |  |  |  |
| Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)(can be severe: fever, malaise, hypotension, capillary leakage, tachycardia, hypoxia, capillary leakage) (during infusion to days) | CAR-T agents, BiTEs, interleukin | Administration occurs in facilities with the expertise and skills to manage the reactions. Patients are usually hospitalized or in specialized facilities for initiation of treatment. Premedication with antihistamines, acetaminophen and hydration. | Mild symptoms are managed supportively based on symptoms (vasopressors, corticosteroids, antihistamines, bronchodilators, oxygen). Severe symptoms require high-dose systemic corticosteroids, possibly ICU care and the anti-IL6 agent tocilizumab.​[52] |
| Hypersensitivity reactions(immune reactions mediated by IgE, histamine, mast cells)(during infusion to within hours) | Traditional cytotoxics: asparaginase, bleomycin, epipodophyllotoxins, platinums, procarbazine | Preventive measures generally not initiated for most agents. For bleomycin, the use of a test dose is suggested but is not universally accepted.​[53] | **antihistamines** |
| Taxanes | **corticosteroids** | **bronchodilators** |  |
| Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of immunotherapies (variable onset, median of weeks) | CAR-T agents, BiTEs, checkpoint inhibitors | Proper education of the patient to respond promptly to symptoms that suggest an irAE is developing. Proactive assessments for irAEs with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., endocrinopathies, pneumonitis)​[26]​[27] | Can manifest as an acute inflammation of any organ and occurs at any time (as early as within hours of first dose to many months after treatment cessation).​[27] Mild symptoms can be managed with routine care; however, high doses of corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone or methylprednisolone sodium succinate) are required for moderate to severe symptoms, with prolonged corticosteroid tapering upon symptom resolution. Severe events usually necessitate discontinuation of the immunotherapy agent.​[26]​[27] |
| Infusion reactions(immunologic reaction that is cytokine-mediated or results from interactions with molecular target) (during infusion to within hours) | Monoclonal antibodies | **rituximab** | Severe reactions require cessation of infusion and administration of vasopressors, corticosteroids, antihistamines, bronchodilators. Consider discontinuation of therapy in severe cases. Mild reactions can be managed by slowing the infusion rate​[56] or administering antihistamines and/or corticosteroids before continuing infusion. |
| Metabolic |  |  |  |
| Hyperglycemia(within days to weeks) | Corticosteroids, PIK3CA inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors | Treat baseline hyperkalemia and manage pre-existing diabetes. Monitor levels while on treatment.​[57]Encourage patient to seek their endocrinologist or primary care provider’s advice for a proactive management plan in case blood sugars rise when starting a new therapy. | Metformin is considered first line.​[57] Manage as per Diabetes Canada guidelines (see Diabetes Mellitus). |
| Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia (within days to weeks) | EGFR inhibitors, platinums | Treat deficiencies prior to administration of cancer therapies. Monitor levels while on treatment. Mg​++ and K​+ given IV with some chemotherapy protocols. | **magnesium** |
| Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)(product of excess cell lysis resulting in hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, which can lead to renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias and seizures)(within hours to days) | Risk of TLS depends on tumor characteristics and the cancer therapy agent used | **allopurinol** | **rasburicase** |
| Musculoskeletal |  |  |  |
| Arthralgias and myalgias (within hours to days) | Aromatase inhibitors, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), interferons, taxanes, others | Increased hydration prior to and during therapy may benefit myalgias associated with interferon.​[60] No proven preventive measures for taxanes or aromatase inhibitors, although gabapentin and antihistamines have been tried.​[61] Naproxen has shown efficacy in the treatment of G-CSF-induced bone pain.​[62]​[63] | **NSAIDs** |
| Osteoporosis (within months to years) | Aromatase inhibitors, antiandrogens | **vitamin D** | See Osteoporosis. |
| Neurologic |  |  |  |
| Autonomic neurotoxicity(bradycardia, postural hypotension, bladder and bowel disturbances, vocal and ocular changes)(within weeks to months) | Vincristine, vinorelbine | **laxatives** | Dose reduction may be necessary with severe toxicity or the drugs may have to be avoided altogether. Rule out other causes that may present with autonomic dysfunction symptoms such as CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease. |
| Cognitive changes(“chemo fog” or “chemo brain”: impaired memory, confusion, decreased concentration)(within weeks to months) | All therapies; severity varies with agent and individual | See Suggested Readings for patient education and nonpharmacologic measures. | “Chemo fog” usually resolves once treatment is complete but can be persistent in a subset of patients. Rule out contributing conditions (e.g., anemia, metabolic disorders). Because pharmacologic (e.g., methylphenidate, modafinil) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., cognitive training) measures for severe deficits have demonstrated mixed results, they are not routinely recommended.​[68]​[69] |
| Laryngeal and pharyngeal nerve toxicity (dysesthesia)(mouth, throat and jaw numbness, pain and spasms, precipitated by cold temperatures)(during infusion or within hours) | Oxaliplatin | Nonpharmacologic measures: avoid cold exposure (e.g., from the wind, refrigerator, cold water) while receiving oxaliplatin.​[70] Symptoms tend to worsen in severity and duration with repeated administration. | **bronchodilators** |
| Peripheral neurotoxicity (sensory and/or motor damage to nerves)(within weeks to months) | Proteasome inhibitors, platinums, taxanes, vinca alkaloids | Usually cumulative dose–related. Education and increased monitoring in patients at risk (e.g., those with diabetic neuropathy) so that dose adjustments can be made prior to severe damage. Avoid extremes of temperature. Maintain skin and nail integrity (moisturizing, skin care) to avoid aggravation of symptoms. No established preventive measures.​[72] | **pregabalin** |
| Renal |  |  |  |
| Hemorrhagic cystitis(diffuse inflammation of the bladder leading to mucosal edema and hemorrhage)(within weeks to months) | Cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide | Mesna, diuresis and hydration administered while on chemotherapy. Administer chemotherapy as early in the day as possible to minimize the amount of damaging metabolites in prolonged contact with the bladder at night. Educate patient to drink plenty of fluids and to urinate frequently. | **alum** |
| Nephrotoxicity (within days to weeks) | Carmustine, ifosfamide, methotrexate, mitomycin, platinums, streptozocin | **sodium bicarbonate** | Correct electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Maintain intravascular volume and urine output. Dose reductions and aggressive hydration with subsequent chemotherapy treatment. Dialysis in severe cases. |
| Reproductive |  |  |  |
| Gonadal toxicity(infertility) (within months to years) | Alkylating agents, other regimens | Sperm, oocyte or embryo banking. The decision to use fertility preservation must be made relatively quickly, ideally before chemotherapy begins. Use chemotherapies with the least effect on spermatogenesis or ovarian function.Gonadotropin-releasing hormones are not indicated but may be considered when proven options are not available.​[77] | Discuss assisted reproduction techniques with patients. Assess for psychosocial concerns that may have developed due to infertility.​[77] |
| Sexuality changes(altered functioning, reduced libido)(within weeks to months) | All therapies | Effects are prevalent in both men and women during and after cancer therapy (can be months or years). Education and communication prior to their development may facilitate management.​[78]​[79] | Ensure any changes in sexual functioning are addressed, rather than ignored or suppressed.​[78]​[79] |
| Other |  |  |  |
| Carcinogenesis(hematologic malignancies, e.g., secondary leukemias; solid tumors, e.g., skin cancers or melanomas)(within years) | Alkylating agents, BRAF-inhibitors, cladribine, etoposide, fludarabine, venetoclax | Monitor/screen patients with risk factors. Type of secondary cancer and timing of onset varies with the cancer therapy regimen used. Use the least amount of cancer therapy possible to control or cure the disease.​[80] | Case specific. |
| Fatigue (within days to months) | Most therapies | Prevent and manage contributing factors (pain, emotional distress, sleep issues, anemia, nutrition deficits, drug-related causes). | Treat contributing factors (e.g., anemia, pain). Exercise may be beneficial for some patients with moderate to severe fatigue, but must be undertaken with caution. Use energy conservation techniques, behavioural therapies and mindfulness techniques.​[81] |
| Flulike syndrome(fever, myalgias, chills)(within hours to days) | Dacarbazine, interferon, gemcitabine, monoclonal antibodies, procarbazine | **acetaminophen** | **acetaminophen** |
| Hot flashes (within days to weeks) | Hormonal therapies | Identify and avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, stress). Employ environmental modification.​[82] | **citalopram** |
| Teratogenicity | Most therapies | Avoid cancer therapies in the first trimester. Avoid exposing patients with the potential to become pregnant to cancer therapies with a high risk of teratogenicity, e.g., antifolates, imatinib, thalidomide and analogues.​[84] | Contraception necessary while patient receives cancer therapy. |

#### Prevention and Management of Side Effects of Radiation Therapy

| Toxicity(time frame to onset) | Location of Radiation | Prevention | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiac |  |  |  |
| Heart disease(arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, valve damage, heart failure, ischemia) (within years) | Breast, head and neck, chest, lung, mediastinum | Manage and control risk factors for cardiovascular disease.​[85] Initiate cardiovascular screening 5 y after radiation exposure (earlier in patients with high risk factors).​[86] | Implement routine cardiac testing (ECG, echocardiography) if asymptomatic changes have been detected. Aggressive control of risk factors for coronary artery disease and implement treatment when there is progressive deterioration (symptomatic or presence of clinically significant changes). There is no evidence that treatment should differ from that used in heart disease due to other causes. |
| Pericardial disease (within weeks for acute; can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Breast, head and neck, lung, mediastinum | Use of shielding methods and lower doses of radiation have reduced the risk of pericarditis.​[85] | **NSAIDs** |
| CNS |  |  |  |
| Cognitive decline | Brain | See Suggested Readings for patient education and nonpharmacologic measures. Memantine may delay cognitive decline in patients undergoing cranial radiation. | Some limited evidence suggests donepezil, methylphenidate and modafinil may improve verbal and working memory, motor speed and quality of life. However, it did not improve overall cognitive performance. Behavioural interventions that focus on mindfulness and strategy training might also be helpful.​[87]​[88]​[89] |
| Edema (within weeks to years) | Brain | No proven preventive measures. | **dexamethasone** |
| Headache (within weeks to months) | Brain | **dexamethasone** | May indicate brain edema (see Edema): assessment needed for persistent headache. Analgesics for symptom control. |
| Somnolence syndrome and fatigue (within weeks to months or chronic) | Brain, head and neck, lung | No proven preventive measures although various agents are under investigation and exploration.​[87] | Corticosteroids may decrease the duration of somnolence syndrome in children.​[89] Also see Table 2, Fatigue. |
| Dermatologic |  |  |  |
| Alopecia (during treatment to within weeks) | Brain | See Table 2, Alopecia. |  |
| Desquamation (during treatment to within weeks) | In radiated area | Wash with mild soaps, shampoos or water alone, using hands rather than abrasive washcloths. Avoid frequent bathing or showering to prevent drying. Avoid friction by wearing loose-fitting clothes. Moisturize radiated area with plain, unscented, preferably lanolin-free hydrophilic moisturizers (e.g., Glaxal Base, Lubriderm). Avoid hot or cold packs, extreme temperatures, harsh chemicals and deodorants in the radiation treatment field. Use an electric razor if shaving is required. Protect from sun. Improve skin elasticity with moisturizers (and sunscreen).​[90]​[91] Application of a soft, silicone dressing (e.g., Mepitel) by the radiation team prior to treatment initiation can provide friction protection and a moist wound healing environment in vulnerable areas of the radiation field (e.g., folds of the skin of the breast or neck) to reduce the severity of radiation-induced moist desquamation.​[92]​[93] Local application of medium- and high-potency topical corticosteroids on radiation days have reduced the severity of dermatitis.​[93] Low-level laser therapy can prevent the occurrence, severity and pain. | If dry desquamation, use saline compresses and moisturize with plain, unscented, lanolin-free moisturizers (e.g., Glaxal Base, Lubriderm) or vitamin E preparations. If moist desquamation, apply principles of moist wound healing using nonadherent dressings. Add absorbent dressings on top if necessary. Hydrogel and hydrocolloid products may also be considered. Systemic analgesics may be required until recovery.​[93]​[94]​[95] |
| Erythema, inflammation and pruritus (during treatment to within weeks) | In radiated area (and exit point) | **topical corticosteroids** |  |
| Fibrosis, skin discoloration, photosensitivity, ulceration or atrophy (within months to years) | In radiated area | **pentoxifylline** |  |
| Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat (EENT) |  |  |  |
| Dental caries (within months to years) | Head and neck | **chlorhexidine** | Progression of caries can be rapid and destructive. Prevention and early dental management is key to preventing tooth loss. Timing of extraction must be weighed against the risk of osteonecrosis induced by the procedure. The risk of osteonecrosis is dependent on the extent of the extraction procedure and the time since last radiation treatment.​[98] |
| Gastrointestinal |  |  |  |
| Bowel adhesions and obstruction (within months) | Abdomen | Early recognition and intervention to prevent morbidity. Educate patient about potential symptoms. | Surgical intervention is required, e.g., bypass or resection. |
| Candidiasis (oral) (“thrush”—white patches or plaques of the tongue and oral mucosa due to infection with the yeast Candida)(weeks to months) | Head and neck | Maintain good oral hygiene. Early recognition and treatment is important to prevent systemic dissemination. Long-term prevention with fluconazole may be required in chronically immune suppressed individuals with recurrent oral candidiasis.​[99] | **fluconazole** |
| Diarrhea (during treatment to within months) | Abdomen, pelvis | See Table 2, Diarrhea. Probiotics containing lactobacilli may have preventative effects but dosing is unclear.​[100] | **diphenoxylate** |
| Esophagitis (during treatment to within weeks and can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Chest or mediastinum, head and neck | Acid-reducing agents to reduce acidity and risk of ulceration of mucosa. Amifostine, a cytoprotective agent, may be used to reduce the incidence and severity of esophagitis without compromising treatment efficacy.​[41]​[101] | **analgesics** |
| Mucositis (oral) (during treatment to within weeks) | Head and neck, abdomen | Benzydamine oral rinse may prevent radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving treatment for head and neck cancer. Some larger centres may use low-level laser therapy to help prevent mucositis in patients being treated with radiation for head and neck cancers.​[41]​[42] | See Mucositis in Table 2. |
| Nausea and vomiting (during treatment to within days) | From highest to lowest risk: total body>upper abdomen, cranial≥head and neck, thorax, pelvis> breast, extremeties | **5-HT3 receptor antagonists** | See Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting for antiemetic options. |
| Proctitis(inflammation of the rectum, causing diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency, tenesmus, possible bleeding and symptoms of obstructed defecation)(weeks to months, or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Abdomen, pelvis | Incidence has decreased with improved radiation techniques and shielding. Amifostine, a cytoprotective agent, may be used to reduce the incidence and severity of proctitis without compromising treatment efficacy.​[41]​[101] | There are no proven techniques for management of proctitis.​[105] Use sitz baths and topical anti-inflammatory preparations for anal irritation. Sulfasalazine can reduce the incidence and severity of acute symptoms.​[106] Topical corticosteroids by enema or suppository (e.g., Proctofoam). Symptomatic management of urgency, tenesmus or loose movements with antispasmodics and antidiarrheals. Sucralfate enemas for chronic proctitis with rectal bleeding.​[107] Treatment interruption or discontinuation. Surgery for difficult-to-treat symptoms or when proctitis complications (e.g., fistulas) are present. |
| Taste alterations(dysgeusia)(within weeks to months or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Head and neck | There are no proven preventive measures. Avoidance of radiation to parotid glands.​[108]​[109] | Experiment with foods; monitor nutritional intake. Alleviate dry mouth to improve taste. Refer for dietary counselling.​[109] |
| Xerostomia(dry mouth, thickened or absent saliva secretion)(during treatment to within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Head and neck | **oral lubricants** | Oral lubricants or artificial saliva preparations. Pilocarpine stimulates saliva production if there is residual salivary function. Stringent oral hygiene is paramount to prevent dental caries and oral infection. Sugary foods and drinks should be avoided.​[102]​[109]​[110] |
| Hematologic |  |  |  |
| Myelosuppression (within weeks to months) | Pelvis, total body |  | See Table 2, Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia and Fatigue. |
| Musculoskeletal |  |  |  |
| Osteoradionecrosis(loss of bone structure in irradiated area accompanied by pain, purulent drainage, and possibly fistula formation between cutaneous and mucosal layers) (within months to years) | Head and neck | Full dental checkup with risk assessment and extraction of problematic teeth prior to radiation. Ideally wait a minimum 7–21 days after an extraction before initiating radiation. Avoid use of ill-fitting dentures or extensive dental extractions postradiation. Control xerostomia and maintain good oral hygiene. Advise on smoking cessation.​[97]​[98]​[109] | **antibiotics** |
| Trismus(inability to open mouth completely due to tonic contraction of muscles of mastication)(within weeks to months) | Head and neck | Early detection and treatment to prevent consequences of condition (poor intake or hygiene). Physical therapy to perform mechanical stretching of the muscles of mastication.​[97] | Prevention is much more effective than treatment once trismus is developed. Mechanical devices to stretch muscles around mouth.​[113] |
| Renal |  |  |  |
| Urinary frequency or dysuria (within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Assess for and avoid drug-related causes in patients at risk, e.g., older patients. | **oxybutynin** |
| Hemorrhagic cystitis (within months to years) | Pelvis | Limit amount of radiation exposure to the bladder if possible. | See Table 2, Hemorrhagic cystitis. |
| Reproductive |  |  |  |
| Erectile dysfunction and reduced sexual function (within months or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Prevalent in all sexes during and after radiation therapy (can be months or years). Education and communication prior to its development may facilitate management. | **sildenafil** |
| Gonadal toxicity | Pelvis, craniospinal | Sperm, oocyte or embryo banking. Ovarian or testicular shielding, surgical transposition may be considered. | See Table 2, Gonadal toxicity. |
| Vaginal irritation (within weeks or can become chronic, with or without first manifesting as acute) | Pelvis | Educate patients on the importance of vaginal dilatation methods. See Female Sexual Dysfunction. | Water-soluble lubricant, vaginal dilators. |
| Respiratory |  |  |  |
| Pneumonitis(cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fever)(within months to years) | Chest | Minimize risk and severity by limiting the area of the lung that is irradiated.​[116] Pentoxifylline has demonstrated benefit in preventing early and late toxicities.​[117] | **dexamethasone** |
| Other |  |  |  |
| Carcinogenesis(basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, others)(within years) | Cervix, chest, oral cavity, pharynx, testes and others | Reduce risk by using modern radiation techniques to limit radiation doses and the volume of normal tissue exposed; regular screening where indicated, e.g., mammography for breast cancer in patients receiving high-dose radiation to the chest. | Cancer specific. |
| Pain flare(within days to weeks) | At area of radiation to the bone | **dexamethasone** | **opioids** |
