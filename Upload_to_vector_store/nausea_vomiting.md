#### Introduction

Nausea is a symptom (not a diagnosis) that refers to the unpleasant sensation of the imminent need to vomit. Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents with contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Nausea and vomiting may be transient symptoms secondary to a self-limited condition such as viral gastroenteritis or part of more complex medical issues. The underlying cause should be determined when possible. Approaches to treatment are dependent on the associated risk factors and diagnosis, which may include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV); opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV); or metabolic, GI, vestibular or neurologic causes, such as motion sickness.​[^[1]]

This chapter addresses the management of general nausea and vomiting. The management of cancer chemotherapy- or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting is addressed in Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Management of Side Effects of Cancer Therapy and Radiation Therapy. The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is addressed in Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

Causes of nausea include:



Complications of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting include esophageal rupture, Mallory-Weiss tears, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, malnutrition, and dental caries.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



To prevent motion sickness, counsel patients to:​[^[3]]



Acupressure wristbands (Sea-Bands) have not been shown to be beneficial for preventing motion sickness. In a controlled study of experimental motion sickness, neither acupressure nor acustimulation were of benefit;​[^[4]] however, a systematic review found no difference between antiemetic drugs and stimulation of the PC6 acupoint on the wrist in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.​[^[5]]

Aromatherapy with inhaled isopropyl alcohol pads (held 1–2 cm below the nostrils) has been shown to be more effective than placebo​[^[6]] or ondansetron​[^[7]] in reducing nausea symptoms within 30 minutes postintervention in adults in the emergency department.

Maintaining fluid intake helps prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. The amount of fluid required depends on the amount lost through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Adults require 1–3 L of total water intake to maintain normal hydration status.​[^[8]] In patients who are vomiting several times daily, additional fluid intake may be needed. For mild dehydration, drinking adequate amounts of water may be all that is required. To treat moderate to severe dehydration, it is necessary to replace electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium). Oral rehydration solutions with appropriate amounts of electrolytes are recommended under these circumstances.​[^[9]]

#### Pharmacologic Choices

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Gastrointestinal Products: Antiemetics; Vitamin and Mineral Products: Single Entity.

Selected agents used in the management of nausea and vomiting are described in Table 1.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] For further discussion of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting, consult Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting and Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy.

When selecting a drug, consider whether the nausea is acute or chronic, review concurrent medications, and attempt to identify the underlying cause of nausea (see Figure 1). A preventive approach may be appropriate in certain situations, for example, in the management of motion sickness. Many patients cannot tolerate oral medications when nauseated, and alternative routes of administration (IM, IV, SC, rectal or transdermal) may be more suitable.

For treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with viral gastroenteritis, there is no evidence that one antiemetic is superior to another. The initial choice should be made on the basis of previous response, available routes of administration, cost, adverse effects and patient preference. These criteria often result in diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate being tried first. Dimenhydrinate consists of 2 drugs (diphenhydramine and 8-chlorotheophylline) and must be metabolized to its active ingredient, diphenhydramine, resulting in a slower onset of action.​[^[12]]

If symptoms are worsened by movement, it may be surmised that acetylcholine is a significant contributor, and anticholinergic agents such as first generation antihistamines, e.g., diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate or hydroxyzine, may be tried first. If symptoms are associated with a feeling of fullness in the stomach, a prokinetic agent such as metoclopramide or domperidone may be a logical starting point. Caution is warranted with these agents since domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death​[^[13]] and metoclopramide is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (even in children) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw). If patients fail to respond to these initial measures, base selection of other antiemetics on adverse effects, available routes of administration, patient preference and cost. Consider trying agents with different mechanisms of action if combinations of antiemetics are to be used.

#### Motion Sickness

Since acetylcholine and histamine are thought to be the most important neurotransmitters causing motion sickness, it follows that anticholinergic and antihistaminergic drugs are fairly effective in controlling it. Prevention is more effective than treatment in established nausea and vomiting.



#### Opioid-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Therapeutic options for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting include the following:



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Since dimenhydrinate is recommended for augmenting pyridoxine treatment in pregnancy​[^[23]] and is considered generally safe in pregnancy, it can be considered for intermittent therapy of motion sickness in pregnant patients. Promethazine may also be used.​[^[23]]

See Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy for therapeutic choices in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can also be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding; other specialized reference sources are provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for managing nausea and vomiting, detailing assessment and treatment strategies.

### Initial Assessment:
- **Thorough patient assessment:**
  - History: Evaluate onset, frequency, appearance of vomit, aggravating/remitting factors, severity, associated symptoms (fever, abdominal pain).
  - Physical examination.
  - Additional investigations as needed (e.g., pregnancy test).

### Non-Pharmacologic Measures:
- **Patient education:**
  - Ensure adequate oral hydration.
  - Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
  - Avoid smells or foods that worsen symptoms.
  - Practice relaxation therapy, etc.

### Treatment Strategy:
1. **Identify and eliminate underlying cause, if possible.**
2. **Tailor pharmacologic treatment to the most likely underlying cause.**

### Specific Conditions and Treatments:
- **Viral Gastroenteritis:**
  - Antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate).
  - Dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine).

- **Motion Sickness:**
  - Review non-pharmacologic measures (e.g., avoid large meals within 3 hours of travel; avoid smoking, alcohol, disagreeable odors, visual stimuli).
  - Antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine).
  - Anticholinergics (e.g., scopolamine patch).

- **Drug-Induced (e.g., opioids):**
  - Explore options like altering administration schedule, reducing dose, using alternate agents, or discontinuing if appropriate.
  - Antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate).
  - Dopamine antagonists (e.g., domperidone, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine).
  - Serotonin 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron).

### If Treatment is Ineffective:
- Combine 2 or more antiemetics from different pharmacologic classes (e.g., antihistamines, anticholinergics, dopamine antagonists, serotonin antagonists).

This flowchart provides a structured approach to assessing and managing nausea and vomiting, emphasizing both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions tailored to specific causes.
