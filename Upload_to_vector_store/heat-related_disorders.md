#### Introduction

Heat-related illnesses and related mortality are largely preventable.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] There is a wide spectrum of heat-related disorders, ranging from mild heat rash or heat edema to potentially fatal heat stroke. Although incidence of heat-related disorders are difficult to quantify,​[^[3]] it is recognized that deaths due to heat-related disorders are under-reported, as cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses also increase during heat waves and may not be attributed directly to the heat.​[^[4]] With timely treatment, the mortality rate for heat stroke has been estimated to be around 10%, but when treatment is delayed, death can occur in up to 80% of cases.​[^[5]] The incidence of these disorders increases with higher temperatures and humidity (i.e., during an extended heat wave). A study of hospital admissions during heat waves found that older adults had a 2.5-fold increase in risk of being hospitalized for heat stroke compared with non–heat wave periods.​[^[6]] As changes to the environment are leading to longer and more frequent and intense heat events, the incidence of heat stress disorders is likely to increase.​[^[7]] Health-care practitioners need to actively promote preventive measures and recognize symptoms requiring immediate action.

#### Pathophysiology

The body’s thermoregulatory centre (the hypothalamus) is responsible for the maintenance of core body temperature (approximately 37°C).​[^[1]]​[^[3]] The body acquires heat through different sources or processes including shivering, physical activity and high ambient temperatures. Heat illness results from an imbalance of heat generated within and absorbed by the body and its ability to dissipate excessive heat.​[^[3]] Because heat dissipation occurs primarily through the skin, preventing or correcting a heat imbalance requires normal skin condition as well as sufficient cardiac output and blood volume to maintain adequate blood flow to the skin.​[^[5]]​[^[8]]

The body eliminates heat by 4 different mechanisms:​[^[1]]​[^[5]]



A reduction in the efficacy of any of the above mechanisms can lead to heat accumulation and increase the risk of developing a heat-related illness. In temperate climates, radiation is the key mechanism to dissipate heat.​[^[5]] In hotter climates, evaporation is the most important mechanism; however, when humidity is high, evaporation plays a lesser role.​[^[1]] If not treated in time, excessive body temperature initiates a series of processes that leads to the collapse of the cardiovascular system, multiorgan failure and potentially death.​[^[1]]​[^[5]]

#### Heat-Related Illness Spectrum

There is a wide spectrum of heat-related disorders, ranging from heat rash to heat stroke. Figure 1 outlines the different heat-related disorders that individuals might experience.

There are 2 types of heat stroke: classic and exertional. Hallmark symptoms of both include an elevated body temperature of over 40°C (measured rectally as this is the most reliable method to determine body temperature compared with oral or tympanic methods; see Fever for more information) and changes in mental status. Older individuals with predisposing health risks who are exposed to risky environmental conditions usually present with classic heat stroke. These patients differ from those suffering from exertional heat stroke in that they typically present with hot, dry skin because of difficulty perspiring.​[^[1]]​[^[9]]

Exertional heat stroke, as its name depicts, usually occurs in younger, healthy individuals who have participated in strenuous physical activity. Competitive athletes and military personnel are typical population groups that develop this form of heat stroke, distinguished by the presence of profuse sweating.​[^[9]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a pyramid diagram illustrating the increasing severity of heat-related illnesses. It is structured in hierarchical layers, with each layer representing a different condition. The conditions are listed from the least severe at the bottom to the most severe at the top. An arrow labeled "Severity" points upward along the left side of the pyramid, indicating the progression of severity.

The layers from bottom to top are:

1. **Heat Rash** - The base of the pyramid, indicating the least severe condition.
2. **Heat Edema** - Above heat rash, indicating a slightly more severe condition.
3. **Heat Cramps** - Positioned above heat edema, indicating further severity.
4. **Heat Syncope** - Above heat cramps, indicating increased severity.
5. **Heat Exhaustion** - Near the top, indicating a serious condition.
6. **Heat Stroke** - The apex of the pyramid, indicating the most severe condition.

This diagram visually represents the escalation of heat-related illnesses, emphasizing the critical nature of heat stroke.

#### Risk Factors

A number of demographic and patient-specific factors (e.g., age, chronic conditions, medication use) as well as behavioural (e.g., participation in strenuous activity) and environmental factors (e.g., relative humidity levels, air temperature) play an important role in determining the risk for developing a heat-related illness. Table 1 outlines these risk factors.

Several population groups are at risk of developing heat-related disorders; these include:​[^[5]]​[^[8]]​[^[16]]



Children were thought to be at increased risk of heat-related illnesses due to physiological and anatomical differences (e.g., reduced sweating due to a greater surface area to body mass ratio, immature thermoregulatory system) and a reduced thirst response to dehydration as compared with healthy adults.​[^[5]]​[^[8]]​[^[16]] However, some recent information suggests that these differences are not as significant, especially in older children.​[^[10]] Infants and preschool children are still considered an at-risk group, partly due to the dependence of young children on others to ensure they stay hydrated and are removed from risky environments, e.g., the inside of a car in hot weather.​[^[8]] Regardless of the reason, caregivers need to be mindful of the potential risks when exposing this population to hot and humid environments. 

Older adults are predisposed to heat illnesses because of comorbid illnesses (including cardiovascular limitations and pulmonary disease), multiple medications and poor thermoregulatory response.​[^[5]]​[^[6]]​[^[16]] Social and behavioural factors such as home containment (not leaving the home on a daily basis), social isolation, bed confinement and an inability to provide self-care put this population at particular risk, especially in more dependent older adults.​[^[6]]​[^[11]]​[^[16]]

In addition to heat-related disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory deterioration have long been identified as consequences of heat waves. An association has been found between heat exposure and higher hospital admission rates in older adults for fluid-related disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infections and septicemia.​[^[6]] The risk of these additional health consequences increased as the period and intensity of the heat wave increased and remained elevated for up to 5 days after the heat wave.

#### Medication-Related Causes

Medications listed in Table 2 can predispose patients to heat-related disorders through various mechanisms that include:



| Mechanism | Drug/Class​[a] |
| --- | --- |
| Increased heat production | Excessive thyroid medicationSympathomimetics |
| Inhibition of hypothalamic regulation | Amphetamines (including MDMA/“ecstasy”)AntipsychoticsOpioids |
| Reduction of sweat excretion(either by direct effects on the skin/sweat glands or through reduced blood flow to the skin) | AlcoholAnticholinergicsAntihistaminesAntiparkinsonian (anticholinergic) agentsAntipsychotics (anticholinergic)Belladonna alkaloidsBeta-blockersCalcium channel blockersCreatine​[b]DiureticsLaxativesLithiumSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsTopiramateTricyclic antidepressants |
| Vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels | Alpha-agonistsMonoamine oxidase inhibitorsSympathomimetics (including pseudoephedrine, cocaine, amphetamines, diet products containing ma huang) |


#### Prevention

Prevention of heat-related illnesses is the primary goal. The first step in prevention is identifying individuals at risk (see Table 1). Health-care practitioners can offer proactive education and tips for these population groups, and when possible, could check on identified at-risk patients during heat waves.​[^[16]] For example, through a medication review, pharmacists can proactively identify and provide guidance to individuals who take medications that may predispose them to heat-related illnesses. Examples of such guidance include modification of strenuous activities, adequate hydration, taper/cessation of discretionary medications, as appropriate.

If possible, encourage these individuals to move to an air-conditioned location and encourage them to participate in social activities or set up regular check-ins by a neighbour, friend or family member. Both have been shown to lower the risk of heat-related deaths during heat waves. Fluid intake should be increased without waiting for the appearance of thirst.​[^[20]] Other potentially helpful measures include taking cool showers or baths.​[^[13]]

Practitioners can recommend athletes with risk factors or who have experienced a previous episode of a heat-related illness and who engage in activities in at-risk environments (e.g., use of heavy equipment, in buildings without air conditioning during a heat wave) to consider a pre-season medical assessment.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

Review of online weather reports and forecasts (e.g., Environment Canada, The Weather Network) can help predict environmental situations where the risk of heat stroke is increased and vigilant monitoring of at-risk individuals is indicated. A humidex reading of 40 or higher in a weather report is considered extremely high and preventative actions should be taken.​[^[23]]

Health Canada has a toolkit intended for use by public health and emergency management officials to warn Canadians about impending heat events. Health-care practitioners may find many aspects of the toolkit useful in developing a communication plan for their own patients and reinforcing the public health message.

If outdoor activities cannot be avoided during periods of high temperature and humidity, the following strategies are recommended to help reduce the risk of heat-related disorders:



Figure 2 provides a stepwise approach to aiding patients in the prevention of heat-related disorders.

#### Goals of Therapy

Prevention of any heat-related disorder is the foremost goal. However, once an individual is displaying symptoms, the goals of therapy are to:



#### Patient Assessment

Information about the assessment of patients with a suspected heat-related disorder can be found in Figure 3.​[^[1]]​[^[5]]​[^[29]]

Symptoms of various heat-related problems present differently depending on the degree or stage of the illness. Patients’ complaints range from edema in the feet to more serious concerns of confusion or coma. The spectrum of disorders is described (from mildest to most severe) in Table 3.

If any acute neurologic symptoms (e.g., altered mental status, confusion or hallucinations, seizures) are present, the person must be taken to the hospital immediately to be assessed and treated. In addition to heat stroke, differential diagnoses include meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperthyroidism, encephalopathy, tetanus, delirium, and overdose of various substances including cocaine and salicylates.​[^[5]]

Other hyperthermia syndromes include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and malignant hyperthermia (MH); however, the underlying causes are drug-related rather than heat-related. Both NMS and MH present with hyperthermia and muscle rigidity but have different etiologies; NMS is induced by antipsychotics and MH by inhaled anesthetics or succinylcholine (postsurgery) in susceptible individuals. Further discussion regarding NMS and MH is outside the scope of this chapter.

| Type of Illness | Features/Symptoms | Therapy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heat rash | “Prickly heat” that appears as a group of small blisters or rashDue to irritation from excessive sweatingUsually located on the neck, upper chest, under the breasts, in the groin area or in elbow creases | Retreat to a cooler and less humid environmentKeep the area dry |
| Heat edema | Edema in the extremities from transient vasodilation of vessels, sodium and water retention, and with prolonged standingMore frequent during the summer months | Elevate feet or handsNo specific pharmacologic treatmentPrevention with acclimatization |
| Heat cramps | Water and sodium depletionCramps in muscles of the arms, legs and stomach are most common Warning sign of heat exhaustionCommon in athletes | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded areaRehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodiumLightly stretch or massage affected musclesAvoid heavy activity for a few hoursSee health-care practitioner if no improvement in 1 h or if symptoms worsen |
| Heat syncope | DizzinessFainting episode | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded areaRehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodiumPatients often recover quickly after falling to the ground (secondary to fainting)Slowly get up from a sitting or supine position |
| Heat exhaustion | WeaknessNausea and/or vomitingTachycardia, hypotensionFatigueDizzinessHeadacheSlightly elevated core body temperature (up to 40°C)FaintingReversible, but can lead to heat stroke if untreated | Stop activity and rest in a cool, shaded area or in an air-conditioned environmentRehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodiumSeek medical attentionRecovery is usually quick, within 2–3 h |
| Heat stroke | Medical emergency—can result in deathSimilar to heat exhaustion with the added feature, in most cases, of neurologic symptoms such as:− altered mental status− hallucinations− seizures− confusion− coma− ataxiaOther symptoms include hot, dry skin (in classic heat stroke), profuse sweating (in exertional heat stroke) and core body temperature >40°CLeads to hepatic and renal failure, central nervous system injury, coagulopathy and cardiovascular collapse | Call 911—take patient to emergency room as soon as possibleIn the interim:− stop activity immediately and rest in an air-conditioned environment (or, if not possible, a cool, shaded area)− immerse body in cold water (for exertional heat stroke), when practical− cool the body (on the way to the hospital) with ice water towels or packs to the groin, neck, axillae and head− remove excessive clothing− rehydrate with an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and sodium− ensure good air circulation around patient |


#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

It is imperative to seek emergency medical attention to address heat stroke immediately, as delaying treatment results in poorer patient outcomes.​[^[5]] While waiting for emergency services, the first priority is to move the patient to a shaded or preferably air-conditioned environment and to cool the patient using external methods such as cool compresses applied to the groin, neck, axillae and head. Increase air flow around the patient and promote evaporation by removing unnecessary clothing, using fans and misting with moderate-temperature water.​[^[5]] Although often impractical, cold water immersion (temperature 1 to 17 ºC) has been shown to reduce core body temperature in patients suffering from exertional heat stroke.​[^[31]] Evidence is not strong for the best cooling method in patients suffering from classic heat stroke.​[^[3]] In situations where cold water immersion is not available, other cooling methods as described above should be used.

Other types of heat-related illnesses are not considered emergencies and can be addressed appropriately depending on severity. Table 3 outlines treatment options for various heat-related disorders.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Medications such as antipyretics do not help reduce the body’s internal temperature and should *not* be used.

Although not the mainstay of therapy, medications can be helpful in treating some of the complications of heat stroke. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam are used to treat seizures and control shivering. Barbiturates have also been used for seizures if benzodiazepines are not effective. Mannitol is used to promote osmotic diuresis and prevent or treat renal failure in patients with rhabdomyolysis.​[^[5]] Dobutamine is the drug of choice for circulatory support.​[^[5]]​[^[32]]

#### Monitoring

Monitoring of individuals at risk of developing heat-related disorders by friends and family is a critical preventive strategy. Health-care practitioners should support patients and caregivers to recognize symptoms that require intervention or medical attention.

For those involved in outdoor activities, proper hydration (see Prevention) is important, as thirst is an unreliable sign of body fluid loss. Individuals should aim for maintaining light-yellow urine.

The extent of recommended monitoring of patients who have suffered a heat-related illness depends on the severity of the illness. Patients with heat exhaustion should avoid further heat exposure for 24–48 hours after a mild injury and avoid exercise for at least 7 days after treatment for exertional heat stroke.​[^[1]]​[^[28]] Heat stroke patients require more intensive monitoring after hospital discharge to manage potential complications, such as chronic renal failure and other organ damage.
