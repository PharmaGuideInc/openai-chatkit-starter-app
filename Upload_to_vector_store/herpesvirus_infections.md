#### Introduction

This chapter addresses treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

In immunocompromised patients, HSV and VZV infections may be more severe and resolve less rapidly than in immunocompetent hosts. The recommended antivirals are the same in both types of patients; however, dosage regimens may be different.

#### Herpes Simplex Virus

#### Introduction

The characteristics of some herpesvirus infections, such as recurrent genital or orolabial herpes simplex virus infection, differ somewhat depending on whether they are caused by HSV type 1 or type 2; however, knowledge of HSV type is not of practical value in guiding selection of drug therapy since both are similarly susceptible to available antivirals. Drug choices are based on the nature and severity of the disease and evidence from controlled clinical trials.

#### Orolabial HSV Infection

Orolabial HSV infection presents as a rash of the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth. The majority of orolabial infections are caused by HSV-1, which is most commonly transmitted via saliva through oral-to-oral contact. HSV-2 causes the majority of genital herpes infections but may also present orally as a result of orogenital transmission. The initial infection can be asymptomatic or present as primary HSV gingivostomatitis, which can affect all of the oral mucosa. When symptomatic, the primary infection is more severe and lasts longer than recurrent infections. Twenty to 40% of infected patients will proceed to develop recurrent orolabial herpes, or herpes labialis, as a result of reactivation of latent HSV. Recurrent infections are less severe and tend to affect the vermilion border of the lips; these are commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters. Sun, stress or illness may trigger a recurrence. Patients may experience prodromal tingling, burning, itching or pain 2–24 hours prior to the appearance of the lesion.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Primary HSV Gingivostomatitis

Table 1 details the antivirals used to treat HSV infections of the mouth.

Primary HSV gingivostomatitis is more commonly seen in children. Managing pain and preventing dehydration are cornerstones of treatment. If the child can swallow, treating mild to moderate gingivostomatitis with acyclovir oral suspension may accelerate resolution of oral signs and symptoms and fever, and reduce the duration of viral shedding.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] If the severity of the disease precludes ingestion of medication, IV acyclovir in pediatric doses analogous to those that are effective and safe in adults with primary genital herpes can be inferred to be appropriate treatment, although no published data support this recommendation.

#### Recurrent Orolabial Herpes

Table 1 details the antivirals used to treat recurrent orolabial herpes.

####### Acute Episodes

While orolabial herpes infections are self-limiting in immunocompetent adults, acute episodes of recurrent orolabial herpes can be treated with oral antivirals for 1–5 days to reduce the severity of the symptoms. The antivirals are well tolerated and have a comparable safety profile.​[^[3]] It is recommended to provide an advance prescription for an oral antiviral to patients experiencing recurrent infections to enable them to initiate therapy immediately at the onset of symptoms.

Oral acyclovir initiated within 1 hour of onset may reduce the duration of pain by approximately 1 day compared with placebo. No other disease parameters, such as time to healing and duration of virus shedding, are expected to improve.​[^[4]]

Valacyclovir is approved for 1-day treatment of cold sores in patients ≥12 years of age.​[^[5]] Valacyclovir self-initiated an average of 2 hours after the earliest symptom of tingling, itching or burning reduced the duration of an episode by about 1 day compared with placebo.​[^[6]] This regimen provides the shortest exposure to the drug and is equally effective when compared indirectly with other regimens.

Famciclovir started within 1 hour of onset of cold sore prodromal symptoms improved a number of lesional symptoms and signs, reduced the duration of pain and tenderness and the median time to healing. Median times to normal skin were 4–4.4 days with treatment compared with 6.2 days with placebo.​[^[7]]

Topical antiviral creams are considerably less effective than oral antivirals, require frequent applications and carry a risk of self-inoculation. **Acyclovir 5% cream** self-initiated within 1 hour of the onset of a recurrent episode reduced the duration of pain by about 1/2 day compared with placebo; however, acyclovir cream is not expected to prevent progression to vesicles, ulcers and/or crusts.​[^[8]] Topical acyclovir ointment may not be as effective.​[^[9]]​[^[10]] In general, topical agents are not recommended.

####### Prophylaxis

For immunocompetent persons with recurrent cold sores, long-term use (>1 month) of daily oral antiviral agents (acyclovir and valacyclovir) can prevent recurrences with no increased risk of adverse events, but the clinical benefit is minimal and the effectiveness of these regimens for periods >4 months is unknown.​[^[11]]

For individuals in whom orolabial herpes is reactivated by exposure to sunlight, oral acyclovir begun 12 hours prior to sun exposure may prevent attacks. Prophylaxis is continued for the duration of sun exposure.​[^[11]]

#### Anogenital HSV Infection

Anogenital HSV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. The majority of anogenital infections are caused by HSV-2, which is transmitted through contact with genital skin, sores or fluids. HSV-1 causes the majority of orolabial herpes infections but may also present as anogenital lesions as a result of orogenital transmission. Genital herpes may be asymptomatic or present as papules and vesicles on the groin, pubic area, genital area, anus, rectum or buttocks that can rupture and lead to painful ulcers. After the initial infection, the HSV becomes dormant and may periodically reactivate and cause recurrent herpes symptoms.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 2 details the antivirals used to treat anogenital HSV infections.

Before embarking on any long-term pharmacologic treatments, it should be emphasized that the diagnosis of genital HSV is sometimes clinically difficult, recurrent ulcers may have other etiologies, and confirmation of HSV infection by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often necessary. Antiviral therapy should be started based upon the clinical diagnosis while awaiting test results.

#### Primary Episodes of Genital Herpes

First episodes of genital herpes in otherwise healthy individuals may range from inapparent to severe. Treatment is effective in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms if initiated up to 7 days after onset.​[^[12]] While oral acyclovir has been shown to be effective,​[^[13]] severe cases of genital herpes require IV acyclovir.​[^[14]] IV treatment is approximately 25% more effective than oral treatment overall, with improved resolution of local and systemic symptoms and decreased time to healing, but results in no difference in viral shedding.​[^[12]] Famciclovir and valacyclovir have comparable efficacy and tolerability to that of oral acyclovir.​[^[15]]​[^[16]] The simplicity of famciclovir and valacyclovir dosing regimens is an advantage over acyclovir when choosing an agent. A 2016 Cochrane review suggests the evidence to support a reduction in the duration of symptoms is of low quality for both oral and IV antiviral therapy and confirms that topical antiviral therapy has no effect in primary episodes of genital herpes.​[^[17]] 

#### Recurrent Genital Herpes

Recurrent genital herpes in immunocompetent patients is treated with oral acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir.​[^[18]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]] When initiated within the first 12 hours after symptom onset, these agents may reduce median times to pain relief and lesion healing by 1–2 days.

Shorter courses of therapy (1–3 days) initiated within hours of symptom onset appear to be as effective as 5-day treatments for episodes of recurrent genital herpes in healthy individuals.​[^[18]]​[^[21]]​[^[22]]​[^[23]]

For individuals with recurring symptomatic genital herpes (e.g., ≥4 episodes per year), chronic suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir for 2–12 months decreases the number of recurrences.​[^[24]] Weak evidence suggests that valacyclovir may be more effective than acyclovir, and either one may be more effective than famciclovir.​[^[24]] Initiation of suppressive antiviral therapy should be based on a joint evaluation of disease burden by the prescriber and patient, irrespective of the number of symptomatic genital herpes episodes the patient experiences per year.​[^[24]] Valacyclovir, 500 mg or 1000 mg, is the only treatment approved for once-daily dosing.

Although suppressive treatment with antivirals significantly reduces HSV-2 transmission, these agents (at standard or higher doses) do not eliminate viral shedding completely;​[^[25]] therefore, encourage patients infected with HSV-2 to adopt safe sex practices and use barrier methods such as condoms even if they are receiving suppressive antivirals. Tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV, has been found to have benefit against HSV-2. Compared with placebo, consistent use of oral tenofovir modestly decreased HSV shedding and herpes lesions in women already infected with HSV-2.​[^[26]] While currently not available in Canada, pericoital application of tenofovir vaginal gel has been shown to reduce the acquisition of HSV-2 in women compared with a placebo gel.​[^[27]] Whether the use of oral or topical tenofovir is an effective strategy to reduce HSV-2 transmission awaits further real-world evidence.

The safety of acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials up to 1 year and, in the case of acyclovir, an uncontrolled study suggested it is safe for up to 5 years.​[^[28]] Interrupt suppression periodically to evaluate the need for continued treatment as the frequency of outbreaks tends to decrease over time. One strategy is to stop every 3–6 months and to await 2 recurrences. A second 3- to 6-month course would be appropriate only if these 2 recurrences are close together (≤2 months apart). This strategy can be continued indefinitely.​[^[29]]

#### Genital Herpes and HIV

####### Primary

In HIV-infected patients, first episodes of genital HSV infection may be more severe and prolonged than in non-HIV infected patients.​[^[30]] Although data from controlled trials are lacking, IV and oral regimens recommended for immunocompetent patients are likely to be effective in HIV-infected patients. However, some experts recommend higher doses and longer duration of therapy than that used in HIV-negative patients, e.g., oral acyclovir 400 mg 3–5 times daily, continued until healing is complete.​[^[31]]​[^[32]]

####### Recurrent

 In HIV-infected patients, treat recurrent genital herpes with acyclovir 200–400 mg 5 times per day, famciclovir 500 mg BID or valacyclovir 1000 mg BID for 5–7 days. Controlled trials have shown that famciclovir 500 mg BID for 7 days is as effective as acyclovir 400 mg 5 times per day for 7 days.​[^[33]] Valacyclovir 1000 mg BID for 5 days was as effective as acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily for 5 days.​[^[34]] Shorter 1- and 3-day courses have not been tested in HIV-infected patients.

In patients with frequently recurring episodes of genital herpes complicating HIV infection, valacyclovir 500 mg BID reduced recurrences by 20% compared with 1000 mg daily.​[^[35]] Famciclovir 500 mg BID reduced recurrences by 69% compared with placebo.​[^[36]] However, oral acyclovir does not seem to reduce transmission of HSV-2 from HIV-1/HSV-2 co-infected individuals to their partners.​[^[37]] All regimens are well tolerated.

There is a significant risk that drug-resistant HSV mutants will be selected by suppressive therapy in HIV-infected patients, especially among those who are severely immunocompromised.​[^[38]] Accordingly, it is important that optimal antiretroviral therapy be coadministered to prevent reductions in immune function as indicated by CD4 count and HIV viral load. If refractory mucocutaneous HSV infection appears, consultation with an infectious diseases expert is advised.

#### Herpes Proctitis

Herpes proctitis refers to the inflammation of the rectal mucosa caused by HSV infection. It can be acquired by anal intercourse or through oral-anal contact.​[^[39]] Symptoms include anorectal pain and mucopurulent or bloody rectal discharge.​[^[39]] Compared with placebo, oral acyclovir has been shown to reduce healing time for first-episode herpes proctitis from 14 to 5 days.​[^[40]]

#### Eczema Herpeticum

Eczema herpeticum is an uncommon HSV infection of eczematous skin that can cause extensive disease (fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy), presumably arising from autoinoculation from a cold sore or asymptomatic viral shedding in saliva. Complications include keratoconjunctivitis, viremia and multiorgan involvement with meningitis and encephalitis.

#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 3 details the antivirals used for the management of HSV infections of the skin.

Acyclovir is expected to significantly shorten disease duration and may be life saving.​[^[41]]​[^[42]] In severe cases, IV acyclovir is recommended.​[^[43]]

There are no published trials supporting the effectiveness and safety of valacyclovir and famciclovir in eczema herpeticum.​[^[43]]

#### HSV Encephalitis

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis and is characterized by acute onset of headache and fever plus focal neurologic signs and symptoms (behavioural changes, speech disturbances and seizures). HSE is thought to arise from retrograde transmission of HSV from the trigeminal ganglia into the brain in adults. HSE is typically caused by HSV-1 and may be the result of primary infection, reactivation or reinfection. When seen in neonates, it is typically due to a primary infection. A brain abscess/cerebritis is the principal differential diagnosis and antibiotic therapy should be included in the initial treatment plan. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended. Long-term neurologic impairment may occur despite treatment.

During therapy, diagnostic testing to demonstrate focal unilateral frontotemporal encephalitis (e.g., MRI, CT), EEG changes and an HSV etiology, typically by detection of HSV DNA from CSF by PCR, should be rapidly undertaken. Viral culture of CSF for HSV is uniformly negative. Acute phase serum may contain no HSV antibody in 1 out of 3 patients. A rise in antibody titre demonstrated in a convalescent phase serum sample indicates primary HSV infection.​[^[44]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 4 details the antivirals used for HSV encephalitis.

Acyclovir has been shown to decrease mortality from 70% to 8–28%.​[^[45]]​[^[46]] Parenteral acyclovir should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of HSE is considered as delay in treatment is associated with poor prognosis.​[^[46]]​[^[47]] The IV dose is infused over at least 60 minutes to prevent obstructive nephropathy caused by formation of acyclovir crystals in the renal tubular lumen. Because acyclovir is eliminated exclusively through the kidneys, extend dosing intervals in the setting of renal dysfunction are required (see Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment). Duration of treatment is usually 21 days. Rarely, relapse with virologically confirmed recrudescence occurs, necessitating prolonged therapy for 10–14 more days.

Valacyclovir and famciclovir have not been evaluated as treatment for HSE.

#### Aseptic Meningitis, Including Recurrent (Mollaret) Lymphocytic Meningitis

HSV-2 is an important cause of aseptic meningitis with or without the presence of mucocutaneous lesions, comprising up to 20% of cases. Recurrent lymphocytic meningitis is chiefly caused by HSV-2 and is estimated to occur in 20–30% of cases following primary HSV meningitis.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Antiviral treatment of acute HSV-2 aseptic meningitis has not been assessed in clinical trials; however, administration of 1 g oral valacyclovir 3 times daily for 7 days is commonly used, particularly in the setting of a primary genital herpes episode. A retrospective observational study of 42 patient-episodes suggests that antiviral therapy is most likely to be useful in immunocompromised hosts to avoid neurologic sequelae. In immunocompetent hosts, antiviral therapy can be withheld to reduce costs and adverse effects.​[^[48]] Suppressive therapy with valacyclovir is ineffective in preventing recurrent (Mollaret) meningitis in patients at high risk, e.g., following an acute episode of HSV-2 meningitis.

#### HSV Keratoconjunctivitis

HSV can cause keratitis and/or conjunctivitis and uveitis. Because of the risk of visual impairment and the potential difficulty in distinguishing HSV conjunctivitis from bacterial infection, consultation with an ophthalmologist is strongly advised if HSV infection is suspected. Consultation with an ophthalmologist for all HSV eye infections, except typical dendritic keratitis, is recommended.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Pharmacologic Choices

Table 5 details the antivirals used for HSV keratoconjunctivitis.

Topical trifluridine is more effective than topical idoxuridine (not available in Canada) for the treatment of keratoconjunctivitis.​[^[49]] The use of oral acyclovir in combination with a topical antiviral may not be better than topical antiviral therapy alone.​[^[49]]

The role of oral acyclovir monotherapy remains unclear. However, oral acyclovir therapy for 12 months was shown to reduce the rate of recurrent stromal keratitis (the most common serious form of HSV ocular disease) in immunocompetent patients.​[^[50]]

#### Varicella-Zoster Virus

#### Chickenpox

Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox presents as an itchy rash that develops into fluid-filled blisters which rupture and scab. The rash normally appears on the head and trunk initially and spreads to the extremities. While chickenpox is generally self-limiting, infants, adults and immunocompromised persons are at risk of developing more severe illness (e.g., prolonged fever, greater number of lesions, prolonged formation of lesions) and experiencing complications (e.g., pneumonia). The virus is transmitted through touching or inhaling the virus particles contained in the blisters and is contagious from 1–2 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have formed scabs, generally 5–7 days after they first appeared. The incubation period is 10–21 days from exposure to symptoms. Diagnosis is generally made from clinical presentation of fever and generalized itchy, vesicular rash. Chickenpox infection usually leads to lifelong immunity; however, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate as herpes zoster, or shingles.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Therapeutic Choices

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antivirals

Table 3 details the antivirals used for the management of VZV.

In healthy children, adolescents and adults, oral acyclovir therapy reduces the number of lesions, total time to crusting and duration of fever, if initiated within 24 hours of rash onset.​[^[51]]​[^[52]]​[^[53]] However, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine use of acyclovir in healthy children.​[^[54]] Consider acyclovir prophylaxis in healthy patients who are at increased risk of moderate to severe varicella such as those ≥12 years of age, pregnant women, patients with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, patients receiving long-term salicylate treatment and in those receiving short or intermittent courses of oral or inhaled corticosteroids. In severe cases, IV acyclovir should be used.

Rare complications such as varicella pneumonia are more common in adults than in children. Lesions in the distal nares are associated with corneal involvement, and should prompt increased vigilance for this complication. It is not known whether acyclovir prevents complications or whether famciclovir or valacyclovir is as effective as acyclovir in the treatment of chickenpox.

In immunocompromised patients, treat chickenpox even if >24 hours have elapsed since the rash began. Data regarding antiviral efficacy in immunocompromised patients are lacking.

#### Vaccines

Table 6 details the vaccines available for the prevention of chickenpox.

**Varicella virus vaccine** is a live attenuated virus vaccine. Two doses of varicella virus vaccine are recommended in healthy patients ≥12 months of age.​[^[55]] Vaccinate all susceptible adults; susceptibility is usually defined by nonreactive VZV IgG serology.

#### Shingles

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is the result of reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after the primary varicella infection. Reactivation is believed to be the result of waning immunity, possibly due to increasing age, medical conditions or medications. Shingles presents as a painful rash, usually in 1 or 2 adjacent dermatomes, generally not crossing the body's midline. The rash develops into vesicles that rupture and crust over and usually heal in 2–4 weeks. The most common complication of shingles is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a nerve pain that persists after the rash has resolved and can last from weeks to years.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Antivirals

Figure 1 provides an algorithm for the management of herpes zoster. Table 3 details the antivirals used for the management of HSV infections of the skin.

Systemic antiviral nucleoside analogues (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) initiated within 72 hours of rash onset reduce the duration of viral shedding, acute pain and the appearance of new lesions.​[^[56]]​[^[57]]​[^[58]]​[^[59]] Increasing age (patients <50 years of age rarely develop postherpetic neuralgia),​[^[60]] severe pain and extensive disease correlate with an increased risk of postherpetic neuralgia.​[^[56]]​[^[60]]​[^[61]] Oral acyclovir does not significantly reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia, and the effect of the other nucleoside analogues on this sequela is not known.​[^[62]] Topical antivirals are not effective in the treatment of herpes zoster.​[^[56]] To prevent ocular complications, treat patients with ocular zoster even if the rash has been present for up to 7 days. Promptly refer patients with ocular complications to an ophthalmologist. Famciclovir and valacyclovir may improve patient adherence because they can be given less frequently, e.g., TID dosing. 

Patients with severe immunosuppression (such as hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies) are at highest risk of VZV dissemination and visceral organ involvement. Disseminated infection is defined as a widespread rash (>20 skin lesions) affecting 3 or more dermatomes or spreading beyond the primarily affected and adjacent dermatome. Visceral dissemination most often involves the CNS (e.g., cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, transverse myelitis) or the lungs (e.g., viral pneumonitis). The drug of choice for treating dissemination in immunocompromised patients is acyclovir 10–15 mg/kg IV every 8 hours. When the infection is under control, switch therapy to an oral antiviral drug until healing is complete or for a minimum of 10–14 days (whichever is longer) to reduce the risk of disease relapse.

In patients co-infected with HIV and HSV-2, viral suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir 400 mg twice daily was found to reduce herpes zoster incidence by 62% compared with placebo.​[^[63]]

#### Corticosteroids, Analgesics and Opioids

Prevention of postherpetic neuralgia using antiviral therapy is not absolute. Analgesics, opioids, gabapentin, pregabalin and corticosteroids may be used in the treatment of acute pain related to herpes zoster.​[^[56]] Corticosteroid therapy improves quality of life (resolution of acute neuritis, uninterrupted sleep and return to normal activity) but does not accelerate healing or reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia compared with acyclovir alone.​[^[64]] The risk of immunosuppression with corticosteroids may hinder their use in high-risk patients, e.g., elderly, patients with diabetes, hypertension, GI ulcers.​[^[65]] Therefore, limit use of corticosteroids to healthy patients with moderate-to-severe pain. For information on postherpetic neuralgia, see Neuropathic Pain.

#### Vaccines

Table 6 details the vaccines available for the prevention of shingles.



A non-live, recombinant, **adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine** was approved in Canada in 2017 for the prevention of shingles in persons ≥50 years of age. The vaccine is administered in 2 doses separated by 2–6 months.​[^[71]] In persons 50–69 years of age, this herpes zoster subunit vaccine demonstrated 97% efficacy against herpes zoster.​[^[72]] In adults ≥70 years of age, the subunit vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against herpes zoster and 89% efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia.​[^[73]] Efficacy in all groups was sustained over 4 years of follow-up.​[^[71]] In adults ≥65 years of age who were vaccinated with live herpes zoster vaccine ≥5 years previously, vaccination with 2 doses of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine 2 months apart was shown to be safe and to induce a strong immune response.​[^[74]]

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Genital herpes in the pregnant woman may result in neonatal herpes, a serious and potentially fatal infection.​[^[75]] Transmission occurs at parturition and is greater if the maternal infection is acquired late in pregnancy than if the mother had been infected prior to becoming pregnant.​[^[76]]

The **guanine nucleoside analogues** have been used extensively in pregnant women with genital herpes suggesting a lack of toxicity to either the fetus or mother. Published data from a population-based historical cohort study of almost 1 million live-born infants in Denmark from 1996 to 2008 demonstrated no association between multiple categories of birth defects and exposure to acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir.​[^[77]] Acyclovir, taken daily beginning at 36 weeks' gestation, reduces recurrences, asymptomatic shedding and the need for casarean section, because herpetic lesions are less commonly observed in labour. Doses of acyclovir 200 mg QID to 400 mg TID are effective and safe.​[^[78]] In managing genital herpes in a pregnant woman, consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended.

Avoid the varicella virus vaccine in pregnancy.​[^[55]]

Acyclovir appears in breast milk in small concentrations both after acyclovir and valacyclovir administration to the mother.​[^[79]]​[^[80]] Exposure to the nursing infant is <2% of the maternal dose or of a therapeutic dose administered to an infant to treat active herpes infections. On this basis, the risk of exposure during breastfeeding is not considered to be clinically meaningful.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.
