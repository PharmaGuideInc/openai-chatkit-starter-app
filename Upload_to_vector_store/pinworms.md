#### Pathophysiology

Enterobiasis is an intestinal infection caused by the nematode Enterobius vermicularis (commonly referred to as pinworm, seatworm, roundworm or threadworm). Although the adult worms resemble white cotton threads about 1 cm in length, the name threadworm is best reserved for Strongyloides stercoralis.

Humans are the only natural host of E. vermicularis. Cats and dogs have been shown to hold eggs on their fur, probably as a result of dust contamination (e.g., shaking bedclothes in their presence) but there is no evidence they can act as carriers of the infection.​[^[1]]​[^[2]]

Transmission of E. vermicularis is human-to-human via the fecal-oral route; mature eggs are transferred from the anus to the mouth and ingested. The larvae hatch in the small intestine and the adults establish themselves in the colon. The time interval of this cycle is about 1 month and the life span of the adults is about 2 months. Mature females migrate to the anus at night and lay eggs on the perianal or perineal skin. The larvae inside the eggs develop and the eggs become infective in 4–6 hours.​[^[3]] These eggs are transferred from the perianal region to hands, clothing, bedding and other surfaces; they can even become airborne and ingested while breathing. The eggs remain infective for up to 20 days.​[^[4]] The most common mode of fecal-oral transmission is on hands and under fingernails, either through scratching or handling infected clothes and linens.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]]

Pinworm infection is particularly common in school children 5–14 years of age and uncommon in children younger than 2 years.​[^[4]]​[^[5]] It is estimated that up to one-third of children globally will be infested during their childhood.​[^[7]] It is the most common intestinal parasite seen in the primary care setting, regardless of socioeconomic circumstances.​[^[4]]​[^[8]]

Enterobiasis is more prevalent in temperate and cold climates because of less frequent bathing and infrequent changing of underclothing.​[^[2]] It is facilitated by factors such as overcrowding in schools and family groupings as well as inadequate personal and community hygiene. Pinworms are more common within families with school-aged children, in primary caregivers of infected children and with institutionalized patients.

Despite the high prevalence of pinworms, it is a rather innocuous parasite. The usual consequences of infection include loss of sleep, discomfort due to anal itching and embarrassment due to the social connotations of having “worms.” Often an entire family is affected. Secondary bacterial infections can occur as complications, e.g., due to excessive scratching. Only rarely have pinworm infections been associated with significant pathology, including vulvovaginitis, dysuria, enuresis, urinary tract infection, appendicitis, chronic salpingitis, and ulcerative lesions of the small and large intestine.​[^[4]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Though most infections are asymptomatic, enterobiasis is often associated with perianal or perineal itching, particularly if there is a high worm burden.​[^[4]]​[^[7]] The itching is worse at night, when the females lay eggs that are attached to the perianal area by a sticky substance that causes pruritus. The itching may contribute to insomnia and restlessness.​[^[2]] Although symptoms may alert the patient to a potential problem, studies have shown no difference in the incidence of “classic” symptoms between infected and noninfected children;​[^[4]] this reinforces the need for actual viewing of the pinworm or its ova for definite diagnosis​[^[6]] (see Diagnosis of Pinworm).

Conditions such as diaper dermatitis, constipation, psoriasis of the anogenital region, and perianal eczema may mimic symptoms of pinworms and should be considered and ruled out in patients presenting with perianal itching before recommending treatment.

Scratching may cause skin irritation. If severe scratching occurs, the skin may break down and allow development of a secondary bacterial infection, eczematous dermatitis or bleeding.​[^[3]] If the worm migrates to the genital area in females, vulvovaginitis, vaginal discharge and irritation may be seen.​[^[3]] Enuresis has also been attributed to pinworms.​[^[2]]

While extensive pinworm infection may cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, these symptoms are not typical of uncomplicated infection. If the patient presents with abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, bloody bowel movements, dysuria, fever, extreme poor appetite, neurotic excoriation (self-inflicted lesions produced by repetitive scratching) or anogenital symptoms associated with sexual abuse,​[^[9]] further assessment and medical attention are required.

A health-care practitioner should be consulted to confirm the diagnosis of a suspected pinworm infestation (see Diagnosis of Pinworm). This is especially important for pregnant patients, children under 12, and those with renal or hepatic impairment.

#### Diagnosis of Pinworm



#### Prevention

Prevention is difficult. However, proper hygiene is helpful and includes careful handwashing after using the toilet, after scratching the perianal area, and before and after eating or preparing food.​[^[1]]​[^[3]]​[^[7]]

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

As with prevention, proper hygiene is an important component of nonpharmacologic management of pinworm infestations. If ingestion of eggs and subsequent reinfection can be avoided, the infection can be self-limiting and eradicate within 4–8 weeks​[^[10]]​[^[11]] (the life cycle of pinworms). In practice, however, this is difficult to achieve and reinfection and ongoing infestation is common; pharmacologic therapy is usually necessary for eradication.

Nonpharmacologic measures should always be used as adjunctive therapy in combination with any drug treatment.​[^[3]]​[^[6]]​[^[7]] These include:



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Anthelmintic Products.

A confirmed diagnosis by an appropriate health-care practitioner is recommended before pharmacologic treatment is initiated to minimize unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects of the anthelmintics. Pinworm infections respond readily to drug therapy, but reinfection is common.​[^[8]] Treatment failure is usually due to reinfection.

Treatment with the anthelmintics mebendazole (prescription only) or pyrantel pamoate (nonprescription) results in a high cure rate with minimal side effects (see Table 2).​[^[5]] Albendazole is also an effective treatment, but is available only through Health Canada’s Special Access Program (SAP). Since these anthelmintics do not reliably kill pinworm eggs, it is prudent to repeat treatment 2 weeks later to eliminate possible reinfection.​[^[1]]​[^[12]] Since reinfection occurs easily, prevention (e.g., handwashing) should always be discussed at the time of treatment. Since pinworms can be passed from one person to another, some experts suggest treating all close contacts of a person with pinworms even if they are asymptomatic to prevent reinfection and spread of pinworms. This is especially important in households where more than one member is infected or where repeated, symptomatic infections occur. The use of laxatives to facilitate removal of pinworms after anthelmintic therapy is not necessary.

#### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Patients who are pregnant should not self-treat and should consult their health-care provider. There is limited data on the use of the available anthelmintics in pregnancy. An asymptomatic pregnant patient with pinworms should be treated after delivery since there are no harmful effects to patient or fetus from the pinworm infection. If the patient is experiencing symptoms that may negatively affect the pregnancy, e.g., weight loss or sleeplessness, treatment may be considered, preferably in the third trimester.​[^[13]] 

Mebendazole should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy; while there is very limited data suggesting no major teratogenic risk, it is insufficient to support use in the first trimester.​[^[14]] Mebendazole is considered compatible in the second and third trimesters.​[^[14]]​[^[15]]​[^[16]] There is insufficient information regarding the use of pyrantel pamoate during pregnancy to assess risk; therefore, use should be avoided in favour of alternative therapies with available pregnancy safety data.​[^[14]]​[^[15]] The WHO recognizes that the effect of pyrantel pamoate on birth outcomes is unknown but supports its use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in circumstances where the benefit outweighs the risk.​[^[13]] While teratogenic effects were observed in animal reproduction studies, there are reports suggesting albendazole is not a major human teratogen.​[^[16]]​[^[17]] Limited evidence has not shown a major risk in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there are records of use in the second or third trimesters of several thousand pregnancies with no reported adverse effects to the fetus.​[^[14]] The WHO allows use of albendazole in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.​[^[18]]

Mebendazole is poorly absorbed, with <10% of an oral dose reaching systemic circulation; the amount transferred into breast milk is clinically insignificant and there have been no reports of adverse reactions in breastfeeding. Although pyrantel pamoate has limited information in breastfeeding, it is also poorly absorbed orally. At the usual dose, mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate are considered compatible with breastfeeding.​[^[15]]​[^[19]]​[^[20]] Albendazole and its active metabolite are minimally transferred into breast milk and are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, there is minimal risk to the infant from a single oral dose for pinworm treatment. An informal consultation group to the WHO concluded that a single oral dose of albendazole can be given to lactating patients.​[^[21]]​[^[22]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 1 provides a monitoring plan framework, which should be individualized.

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Endpoint of Therapy | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perianal itching | Parent/patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: day 7 | Resolution of itching | If itching has not resolved within 7–14 days of starting medication, repeat treatment. If itching has not resolved within 7 days of beginning second course, or if signs of bacterial superinfection occur, refer to an appropriate health-care practitioner for further assessment. |
| Adverse effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps | Parent/patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: day 1 after treatment | Minimal gastrointestinal effects | If adverse GI effects interfere with functioning or persist for more than 3 days after treatment ends, consult with an appropriate health-care practitioner. |
| Adverse effects: dizziness, drowsiness | Parent/patient: dailyHealth-care practitioner: day 1 after treatment | Minimal drowsiness or dizziness | Caution patient not to drive or use hazardous machinery until effect of drug is known. If symptoms interfere with function or persist more than 24 h after treatment, consult with an appropriate health-care practitioner. |

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient presenting with symptoms consistent with pinworm infection, specifically irritating perianal or perineal itching that worsens at night. Here is a breakdown of the flowchart:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - **Symptoms:** Patient presents with symptoms consistent with pinworm infection.
   - **Differential Diagnosis:** Rule out other conditions with similar symptoms such as hemorrhoids, constipation, diaper dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, perianal infection, pubic lice, IBD, STIs.
     - If any are present, treat the condition or refer as needed.
     - If none, proceed to the next step.

2. **Red Flags Assessment:**
   - Check for red flags requiring referral:
     - Nausea and vomiting
     - Fever
     - Abdominal pain
     - Extreme poor appetite
     - Diarrhea or bloody bowel movements
     - Dysuria
     - Neurotic excoriation (self-inflicted lesions from scratching)
     - Perianal rash or anal discharge (may indicate other infections)
     - Anogenital symptoms associated with sexual abuse
   - If any are present, refer the patient.
   - If none, proceed to visual identification.

3. **Visual Identification:**
   - Identify ova or worm via:
     - Flashlight test
     - Scotch-tape test
     - Paddle test
   - Alternatively, microscopic analysis of subungual samples by a healthcare provider.
   - If no worms or ova are identified, refer the patient.
   - If identified, proceed with treatment.

4. **Nonpharmacological Measures:**
   - Always use as adjunctive therapy:
     - Showering each morning
     - Avoid co-bathing and reusing washcloths
     - Handwashing and fingernail cleaning
     - Keeping fingernails short
     - Discourage nail biting and thumb-sucking
     - Encourage wearing clean underpants
     - Wash nightclothes, underwear, and towels
     - Change bedding regularly
     - Avoid shaking linens
     - Clean sleeping areas thoroughly
     - Wash toilet seat daily

5. **Pharmacological Therapy:**
   - Rule out contraindications:
     - Hypersensitivity to agent
     - Pregnancy (first trimester)
     - Child <1 year of age
   - If any contraindications are present, refer the patient.
   - If none, proceed with medication:
     - Pyrantel pamoate: 1 tablet (125 mg base)/11 kg (25 lbs), max 1 G single dose PO
     - Mebendazole: ≥2 years of age, 100 mg single dose PO
   - Treat all close contacts of the patient.

6. **Follow-up:**
   - If symptoms are resolved:
     - Re-treat in 2 weeks to prevent reinfection
     - Reinforce ongoing hygiene
   - If symptoms are unresolved:
     - If symptoms worsen or adverse effects occur, refer for further assessment.
     - If itching not resolved within 7 days, refer for further assessment.

This flowchart provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing pinworm infections, including both nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions.
