CPhA strives to provide guidance for health-care professionals on the appropriate care of all individuals. However, we recognize that in this chapter, our content is based on clinical research studies of patients who may not reflect the identity of the individual patient presenting. Other resources exist that may be helpful, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) Standard of Care. When the terms “women” and “men” are used in the text, they are used to maintain accuracy with what is reported in the clinical literature. We are aware these terms are not inclusive of all patients. 

#### Introduction

**Vitamins** and **minerals** cannot usually be synthesized in the body but occur naturally in certain foods. They are essential in small quantities for normal body metabolism, functioning as cofactors within enzyme systems required for the function of life. Some vitamins such as A and D serve in hormonal or epigenetic pathways. If steady intakes are not met, deficiency diseases occur, which can sometimes lead to death. However, excess intake can result in toxicities, even at doses which were once generally thought to be safe. Most individuals in North America ingest sufficient vitamins and minerals in their diet to prevent deficiency diseases; a small number may be at risk and require supplementation of particular nutrients for identified deficiencies. Insufficient vitamin D levels may be common in Canadians due to our Northern climate, since vitamin D is derived primarily from exposure to sunlight.

Nutritional supplements are defined as consumable health products that contain a nutrient or group of nutrients (vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats and oils) that occur naturally in food and that are required for normal functioning of the body. They are intended to supplement but not be a substitute for a healthy diet. Nutrient supplementation can contribute to overall health and vitality, providing sufficient vitamins, minerals and other nutrients for prevention of deficiency diseases. Although preliminary studies may suggest that nutrient supplementation prevents or reduces risk of chronic disease, a benefit is yet to be proven by large trials in most cases. Additionally, unnecessary long-term nutrient supplementation may be harmful.

Chronic intake of some drugs can affect or interact with vitamins and minerals. Depending on the nature of interaction, it may be necessary to avoid combination therapy, or drug therapy may necessitate supplementation.

#### Dietary Reference Intakes for Nutrients

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are a comprehensive set of nutrient reference values for healthy populations that can be used for assessing and planning diets.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] Established cooperatively by Canada and the United States, DRIs are derived from scientific data and provide a range of values from optimal to maximum based on indicators of good health, prevention of chronic disease and evaluation of the possible adverse effects of excess intake. The DRIs encompass the reference values described below.

The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the median usual intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life-stage. At this level of intake, the other half of the individuals in the specified group would not have their needs met. The EAR is based on a specific criterion of adequacy, derived from a careful review of the literature. Reduction of disease risk is considered along with many other health parameters in the selection of that criterion. The EAR is used to calculate the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).​[^[1]]​[^[2]] RDA is defined as the average daily dietary intake level thought to be sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97–98%) healthy individuals in a particular life-stage.​[^[2]]

The Adequate Intake (AI) is a recommended average daily nutrient intake level based on observed/experimentally determined estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people who are assumed to be maintaining an adequate nutritional state. The AI is used when there are insufficient data to establish the estimated average requirement on which to base the RDA of a nutrient. It is expected to meet or exceed the needs of most people in the age, gender or life-stage group.​[^[2]]

A diet with nutrient content below 10% of the EAR is considered the threshold for inadequate intake.​[^[3]] Nutritional deficiency refers to an inadequate supply of a particular nutrient that results in illness or disease and is corrected by supplementation of the deficient nutrient. Nutritional deficiency may be the result of inadequate dietary intake or impairment of digestion, absorption, transport or metabolism.

Table 2 provides selected DRIs for common nutrients. Table 3 provides information on the roles, food sources, deficiency states and toxicity related to excess intake of the **fat-soluble vitamins** (A, D, E and K). Table 4 provides information on the roles, food sources, deficiency states and toxicity related to excess intake of the **water-soluble vitamins**: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), biotin (B7), folic acid (B9), cyanocobalamin (B12) and ascorbic acid (C). Choline, while not a vitamin, is an essential nutrient usually grouped with the B-complex vitamins. Table 5 provides information on selected **essential minerals**. Macrominerals (with requirements measured in mg to g per day) include calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium and sodium, while microminerals (with requirements measured in mcg to mg per day) include copper, chromium, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, vanadium and zinc.

#### Goals of Therapy



Treatment of a disease or condition with micronutrient supplementation should be supported by good evidence and monitored for adverse events.

#### Indications for General Preventive Supplementation

A benefit from micronutrient supplementation is unlikely for most of the general adult population;​[^[4]]​[^[5]] encourage consumption of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and fish, as these may contain other important nutrients required for optimal health (e.g., phytochemicals such as flavonoids, isothiocyanates, isoflavones, saponins) and have been shown to decrease risk of chronic disease and mortality.​[^[6]]​[^[7]] Most Canadians have adequate intake of micronutrients, although deficiencies in vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc and folate have been identified in high-risk groups (e.g., those at the lowest level of income and/or education).​[^[8]] See Table 6 for a discussion of common deficiencies.

Certain groups of individuals may require specific preventive supplementation.

**Conditions with increased requirements:**



**Conditions with risk of inadequate intake:** 



**Conditions with risk of malabsorption:**

#### Fat-Soluble Vitamins

| Nutrient | Role and Sources | Deficiency State | Toxicity | Prevention of Toxicity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **vitamin A** | Required for vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, cell differentiation. Regulates immune system and gene transcription.Vitamin A exists in 2 forms: provitamin A (e.g., beta carotene, alpha carotene, beta cryptoxanthin) and preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol, retinal, retinoic acid).Food sources of preformed vitamin A: liver, fish oils, whole milk, eggs, fortified food products. | Deficiency rare, but inadequate intake of retinol reported in 35% of Canadians ≥19 y​[2]Abnormal visual adaptation to darkness:​[29]​[30]changes in conjunctiva called Bitot spotssevere deficiency causes blindnessDry skin, hair and eyes​[29]​[30]Broken fingernailsDecreased resistance to infections (diarrhea and measles)​[29]​[30]Papillary hyperkeratosis of the skin​[29]​[30]Patients/populations at risk of vitamin A deficiency:​[1]recent immigrants or refugees from developing countries with high incidence of vitamin A deficiencypatients with Crohn diseasepatients with celiac diseasepatients with pancreatic diseases | TUL: 10 000 units/day.Teratogenic at doses >10 000 units/day. Hepatotoxic.High intake of preformed vitamin A through diet or supplementation may be associated with osteoporosis and fracture risk;​[31] can occur subclinically without signs or symptoms of hypervitaminosis at total doses of 5000 units/day; risk may be highest in those with low vitamin D intake.​[32]Vitamin A and beta carotene supplementation, singly or combined, increase risk of overall mortality.​[33] | Avoid supplementation of preformed vitamin A (retinol) in populations not at risk for deficiency.Encourage dietary intake from vegetables and fruits as there is no evidence of increased osteoporosis risk from dietary intake. |
| **beta carotene** | Food sources of provitamin A (beta carotene and other carotenoids): leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits. |  | No TUL established for dietary beta carotene.​[33]Oral beta carotene supplements increase risk of first-time nonfatal MI, increase risk of CV mortality in adult males who smoke;​[34]​[35] increase risk of lung cancer diagnosis and death in patients at high risk.​[35] Vitamin A and beta carotene supplementation, singly or combined, increase risk of overall mortality.​[33] | No RDA established, but 3–6 mg/day is recommended.Supplementation with beta carotene not generally required but may be used for patients/populations at risk of vitamin A deficiency (see Vitamin A).High serum concentrations of alpha-carotene (also found in yellow-orange and dark green vegetables) are associated with decreased risk of mortality.​[36]Lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that do not have vitamin A activity but have health-promoting activity. |
| **vitamin D** | Modulates transcription of >50 genes in cell differentiation, immunity, insulin secretion, hypertension. Required for calcium metabolism.D3 (cholecalciferol) and D2 (ergocalciferol) are the 2 main forms found in food and dietary supplements, and are both absorbed well in the small intestine.Food sources: salmon, sardines, tuna and fish oils, fortified milk/orange juice, some mushrooms.Sunlight (activates 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin). | Insufficiency and deficiency common in Canadians (see Table 6)Children:​[37]rickets (costochondral beading, epiphyseal enlargement, bowed legs, persistently open anterior fontanelle)Adults:​[37]osteomalacia/osteoporosis | TUL: 4000 units/day. Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, reversible renal impairment, GI symptoms.Single yearly high doses (500 000 units orally or 300 000 units IM) have been associated with increased risk of falls and fracture rates especially in the first months post-dose.​[38]400 units/day plus 2 g/day of calcium was associated with small increased risk of nephrolithiasis.​[39]Persons with primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and lymphoma may have increased risk of hypercalcemia with supplementation. | Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) most useful in primary care.Avoid large single doses (10 000 units or more).Total amounts of vitamin D ingestion from various supplements should be recorded/monitored. |
| **vitamin E** | Required as an antioxidant for protection from damaging effects of free radicals.Food sources: nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, egg yolk, wheat germ, fortified or enriched grain products. | Children:​[40]hemolytic anemia in premature infants and newbornshyporeflexiaspinocerebellar and retinal degenerationAdults (rare):​[40]overt deficiency syndromes in adults have never been described | TUL: 1000 mg (1500 units)/day.GI upset at doses of 200–800 mg/day; antiplatelet effects and bleeding at 800–1200 mg/day. Other toxicity can occur at 1200 mg/day (emotional disturbances, thrombophlebitis, lipid and thyroid effects, gonadal dysfunction).​[41]Intervention trials have not supported the hypothesis that vitamin E decreases CV risk​[42]​[43] or prevents cancer.​[42]​[44] Vitamin E supplementation: Showed a small increased risk of heart failure in people at high risk of CVD​[44]May increase risk of death from any cause at doses >400 units/day​[45]Has no significant effect on the incidence or number of days of respiratory infections or antibiotic use​[46]May increase risk of prostate cancer​[47] | Little or no supplementation in patients with a history of stroke, CABG surgery, MI or those at risk of prostate cancer. Limit vitamin E supplementation for others to <400 units/day.Ensure no significant drug-nutrient interactions, which can increase bleeding risk (see Table 7). |
| **vitamin K** | Required for blood clotting and bone formation.Food sources: broccoli, soybeans, dark green leafy vegetables. | Neonates (common):​[48]​[49]prolonged bleeding and prothrombin time, hemorrhagic manifestations in newbornsAdults (uncommon):​[49]unexpected or excessive bleedingRisk factors:alcohol abusegeneral malnutritionmalabsorption statesdisseminated intravascular coagulationparenchymal liver diseasepolycythemia vera | TUL has not been determined. | Single ingredient oral supplements are not available in Canada.Excess intake of vitamin K from food sources may interfere with the effect of vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants, e.g., warfarin. |

| **vitamin B5** | Component of coenzyme A, which is required to produce energy from food.Food sources: liver, kidney, yeast, egg yolk, legumes, broccoli. | Deficiency exceptionally rare | TUL has not been determined. |  |
| **vitamin B6** | Has role in production of >100 enzymes required for chemical reactions, e.g., glycogen phosphorylation.Food sources: fortified cereals, poultry, potatoes, spinach, avocados, bananas, nuts. | Severe deficiency uncommonInadequacy associated with:microcytic anemia (see Common Anemias)seborrhoeic skin lesionsconvulsionsirritability, nervousness, insomniaperipheral neuropathy (distal limb numbness appears early; distal limb paresthesia or burning foot syndrome occurs later)Pyridoxine neuropathy occurs in both deficiency and toxicity statesDeficiency also leads to hyperhomocysteinemia Risk factors:sickle cell diseasemalnutrition and malabsorptiondialysisrheumatoid arthritistreatment with isoniazid, hydralazine, pyrazinamidealcohol abuse | TUL: 100 mg/day.Sensory neuropathy with progressive ataxia can occur with high-dose supplementation (100–500 mg/day); reversible upon discontinuation. Rare cases of permanent neuropathy have been reported.An increased risk of hip fractures in postmenopausal patients has been observed with very high intake of combination vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.​[52] | Avoid high-dose supplementation. |

| **vitamin B12** | Required for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis and neurological function.Food sources: meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, poultry, fortified cereals. | Pernicious anemiaNeurologic deterioration:peripheral neuropathycognitive impairmentpsychotic symptomsseizuresDeficiency common in Canada​[58] (see Table 6) | TUL has not been determined.An increased risk of hip fractures in postmenopausal patients has been observed with very high intake of combination vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.​[52] |  |
| **vitamin C** | Required for collagen formation, L-carnitine and protein synthesis. Maintains integrity of skin, connective tissue, bone, blood vessel walls and dentine.Required for wound healing and recovery from burns.Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and regenerates other antioxidants including vitamin E.Food sources: fruits (especially citrus), vegetables (peppers). | Chronic, severe deficiency results in scurvy (rare)Early presentation:malaise and lethargyirritabilitydry mouth and eyesSkin changes include perifollicular hemorrhages, corkscrew hairsPurpura/ecchymoses seen on legs or buttocksSplinter hemorrhagesBleeding gums, friability, tooth lossAnemia and high output heart failure seen late in the diseaseFractures, bleeding into muscles and jointsLower extremity pain and refusal to bear weightRisk factors:receiving only cow’s milk during first year of lifealcoholismelderlylow incomesmokingincreased need in pregnancy and lactation, thyrotoxicoses, burns, insulin deficiencydialysis​[51]anorexia nervosa or anorexia due to cancer or HIV infectionfad diets or severely restricted eating patterns (e.g., in children with autism spectrum disorders or developmental delays)​[24]​[25]Depletion can occur within 1–3 months; fatal if untreated but prevention requires only 35 mg/day | TUL: 2 g/day.Several grams taken at once can cause nausea, vomiting, esophagitis and heartburn, flushing, and diarrhea. Sleep disturbances and fatigue have also been reported.Long-term ingestion of 2 g/day may precipitate urate or oxalate stones in the urinary tract and increase risk of nephrolithiasis.​[60] | Limit supplementation to <2 g/day. |
| **choline** | Although not a vitamin, choline is an essential nutrient for structural integrity of cell membranes, cholinergic neurotransmission, and lipid and cholesterol transport and metabolism. Accelerates synthesis and release of acetylcholine. Food sources: milk, liver, eggs, peanuts; small amounts are synthesized in humans from phospholipids. Dietary sources provide approximately 730–1040 mg/day of choline, mostly as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine).​[59] |  | TUL: 3.5 g/day. Ingestion of 7.5 g/day may cause hypotension. Cholinergic signs (sweating and diarrhea) and a fishy body odour may occur with doses of 10–16 g/day.​[59] |  |
| **folic acid** | Required for new cell growth formation and maintenance, especially during periods of rapid growth.Food sources: legumes (cooked kidney, pinto, fava beans), green leafy vegetables (spinach), liver, fortified flour (mandatory in Canada), fortified breakfast cereals, oranges. | Megaloblastic anemia (see Common Anemias)Adverse fetal outcomes:neural tube defectsorofacial cleftscardiovascular malformationsRisk factors:anorexia nervosamalabsorptionalcohol abusehyperthyroidismpregnancy and lactationdialysis​[51] | TUL: 1000 mcg/day.Doses >1500 mcg/day can cause irritability, confusion, exacerbation of seizure frequency, precipitate or exacerbate vitamin B12 deficiency.Potential increase in CV risk and colon cancer;​[53]​[54] and chronic high doses may increase risk of solid cancers.​[55]Increased rate of cognitive decline in elderly who take large doses is possibly related to low vitamin B12 levels.​[56] | Studies demonstrate mixed results regarding unmetabolized folic acid or intracellular folate and increased cancer and CV risk;​[53]​[57] more study is required to delineate risk-benefit profile.Avoid supplements unless higher folate need is identified, e.g., pregnancy, breastfeeding, methotrexate use.Limit total supplement intake to ≤0.4 mg/day. Emphasize foods high in folate (e.g., green leafy vegetables, fruits) as intake from foods is not associated with adverse effects. |

#### Selected Macro- and Microminerals

| Nutrient | Sources | Toxicity | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **calcium** | Food sources: dairy products, calcium-set tofu, fortified foods, kale and related greens (broccoli, bok choy, cabbage).Deficiency not uncommon in selected patient groups in Canada (see Table 6). | TUL: 2500 mg/day.Studies demonstrated mixed results concerning increased risk of cardiac events, particularly MI, if excess calcium supplementation is used with or without vitamin D.​[61]​[62]​[63]​[64]​[65]An increased risk of stroke has also been observed when used in combination with vitamin D.​[66]Calcium intake of >2 g/day (dietary or supplement) may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.​[67] Transient elevations with calcium supplementation may affect non-skeletal calcium pathways.More trials required to determine if there is a risk of calcium supplementation, especially in persons with adequate dietary calcium intake. | Typical diet provides 500–1000 mg elemental calcium/day; avoid total amounts (from diet and oral supplements) >1.2 g/day.Ensure adequate vitamin D intake. |
| **iron** | Food sources: heme iron sources (from hemoglobin): meat, poultry, fish.nonheme sources: firm tofu, legumes (dried beans, peas, lentils), nuts and seeds, fortified grain products (e.g., flour, bread, pasta and breakfast cereal).Deficiency not uncommon in selected patient groups in Canada (see Table 6). | TUL: 45 mg/day.Excess iron is stored in tissues and organs, e.g., liver, heart and may lead to cirrhosis, heart failure.Iron is extremely toxic in overdose; accidental poisoning/death has occurred in children with ingestion of as little as 200 mg.​[68] | Avoid supplementation unless prescribed for known or suspected iron deficiency or for increased need (see Common Anemias).Absorption of nonheme iron, e.g., from plant sources, may be influenced by enhancers (ascorbic or malic acid) or inhibitors (polyphenols, phytates, soy protein). |
| **magnesium** | Food sources: green leafy vegetables; nuts, seeds, whole grains, foods high in fibre. | TUL: 350 mg/day.Acute: doses of >5 g are associated with hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing leading to muscle weakness, breathing difficulties, cardiac arrhythmias (plasma levels >1.74–2.61 mmol/L).Chronic: high doses from supplementation/medications may cause diarrhea, nausea, cramping. | Average intake is generally less than recommended; however, low dietary intake does not generally result in symptomatic magnesium deficiency.Toxicity risks increased with impaired renal function. |
| **potassium** | Food sources: fruits and vegetables, especially tropical fruits, baked potatoes with skin. | TUL has not been determined for healthy adults.Doses >11 g as a single dose may lead to hyperkalemia in persons who are not accustomed to high intakes even if there is normal kidney function. Acute or chronic renal failure, excessive aldosterone secretion and medications (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACEIs, ARBs, SMX/TMP) increase risk of hyperkalemia. | Routine supplementation of potassium is not recommended.For more information on hyperkalemia, see Potassium Disturbances. |
| **selenium** | Food sources: organ meats, seafood; plant sources dependent on selenium content of soil.Average diet provides approximately 100 mcg/day. | TUL: 400 mcg/day.Selenosis (hair and nail brittleness and loss, GI upset, garlic breath odour, fatigue, irritability and mild neuropathy) is rare.​[1] Cases were reported in 13 subjects taking supplements which, due to a manufacturing error, contained 27.3 mg (27 300 mcg) per tablet.​[69] |  |
| **zinc** | Food sources: shellfish, red meat, nuts, legumes. | TUL: 40 mg/day.Acute: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal cramps.Chronic: doses 150–450 mg/day affect copper status, alter iron function, decrease immune function, decrease HDL.Doses >80 mg/day as used in AREDS have been associated with significant increase in genitourinary hospitalizations.​[70] | Avoid high-dose supplementation.Monitor persons on high doses of zinc for treatment of macular degeneration for genitourinary effects (urinary retention, UTI, urinary lithiasis).For more information, see Age-Related Macular Degeneration. |

#### Supplementation to Prevent or Treat Common Known Deficiency States

| Deficiency | Patient Groups Affected | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **vitamin B12** | Persons with macrocytosis or neurologic symptoms.Persons >60 y (marginal depletion reported to be >20%).​[72] Persons with gastric, ileal, pancreatic, Crohn or celiac disease.Post-bariatric surgery patients.Persons with chronic use of PPIs, metformin or H2 receptor antagonists.Persons on exclusion diets.​[73] | For treatment of pernicious anemia, see Common Anemias.Encourage persons at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency to consume foods high in vitamin B12.Malabsorption of vitamin B12 from food is the main cause of deficiency in the elderly.Consider 1000 mcg/day orally for persons taking drugs known to deplete vitamin B12 stores. |
| **vitamin D** | Approximately 10% of Canadians have inadequate levels for bone health and are at risk for rickets or osteomalacia; 60% have levels <75 nmol/L,​[82] the suggested level needed for overall health and disease prevention.Increased risk of deficiency/suboptimal levels include:​[74] Dark-skinned individualsLack of sunlight due to Northern latitude, use of occlusive clothing, staying indoors, e.g., elderly, patients with obesity or who are institutionalizedMedication-induced (see Table 7)Modest decrease in overall mortality, primarily seen in elderly women who are institutionalized or in dependent care.​[83] | Health Canada RDA (see Table 2) differs from those of other groups: Osteoporosis Canada​[84] recommends routine vitamin D supplementation for all Canadian adults year round:Adults 19–50 y (including pregnant or breastfeeding patients): 400–1000 units dailyAdults >50 y and those at high risk:​[c] 800–2000 units dailyInternational Osteoporosis Foundation:​[85]Older adults: 800–1000 units/dayPatients with obesity, those with limited sun exposure, non-European populations: 2000 units/dayCanadian Cancer Society:​[86] Adults during fall and winter months: 1000 units/dayAdults ≥50 y, those with dark skin or little sun exposure: 1000 units/day year-roundCanadian Paediatric Society:​[87]Pregnancy and breastfeeding: consider 2000 units/day, especially during winter months​[d]Maintenance range: 400–2000 units/day.Evidence and safety supports use of 800–1000 units/day in Canadians.For severe deficiency (levels <25 nmol/L), consider bolus dosing followed by maintenance:2000–4000 units of D3 daily for 8–20 wk or600 000 units of D2 over 8 wk, e.g., 50 000 units weekly for 8–12 wk​[74] Optimal form of vitamin D and regimen for bolus dosing for severe deficiency have not been established.Appropriate vitamin D levels may improve dietary absorption of calcium.​[74]​[88] |
| **calcium** | Postmenopausal patients.​[89]Vegans or those who limit dairy product intake, e.g., due to lactose intolerance.Persons with anorexia or excess exercise leading to amenorrhea.​[90] | In postmenopausal patients, ≤400 units vitamin D and ≤1000 mg calcium supplements provided no benefit for the primary prevention of fractures;​[91] high-quality evidence for the benefit of higher doses of vitamin D is lacking but 800–2000 units/day is often recommended.​[89] Excess calcium supplementation should be avoided (limit to ≤1200 mg/day from all sources).​[89] Calcium carbonate should be taken with food to improve absorption; calcium citrate can be taken without food and is more readily absorbable. Avoid doses >500 mg elemental calcium at one time, as absorption is highest in doses ≤500.Constipation, gas or bloating may be managed with smaller, more frequent dosing, or differing formulations or salts.Vegans and others who limit dairy intake can also obtain adequate dietary calcium through foods such as beans, tofu, nuts, fortified nut or soy beverages, blackstrap molasses, and a variety of vegetables including low-oxalate greens, e.g., bok choy, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, collards and kale.​[15]​[92] |
| **iron** | Female adolescents, patients with heavy menstrual losses.Those at high risk of malabsorption, e.g., Crohn or celiac disease.Patients with renal failure, especially those on dialysis.Persons who engage in intense aerobic exercise; female and vegetarian/vegan athletes; distance runners may also be at risk.​[68] | Adult men and postmenopausal patients should not take a supplement unless evaluated, as deficiency is rare and supplementation may be harmful.​[20]Vegetarians/vegans should consider consuming nonheme sources of iron together with foods high in vitamin C (e.g., citrus fruits) to improve absorption. |

#### Clinically Significant Drug-Nutritional Supplement Interactions

| Supplement | Drug/ Lab Tests | Interactions | Management |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **vitamin A** | Hepatotoxic drugs (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, isoniazid, methotrexate) | May increase risk of liver disease. | Avoid combination. |
| Retinoids (isotretinoin, acitretin, etretinate, tazarotene) | Additive toxic effects. | Avoid combination. |  |
| Warfarin | Increased risk of vitamin A toxicity and bleeding. | Avoid combination. |  |
| **vitamin B3** | Antihyperglycemic agents | Impairs glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. | Doses >4 g/day may increase plasma glucose by an average of 16% and HbA1c by 21%; increased requirements for antihyperglycemic agents may be necessary. |
| Carbamazepine | Niacin 60–80 mg/day may increase carbamazepine levels. | Monitor carbamazepine levels, avoid niacin supplementation. |  |
| Statins | Increased risk of myopathies. | Monitor signs and symptoms, use lowest dose possible. |  |
| **vitamin B6** | Antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbital) | Can decrease phenytoin and phenobarbital serum levels by increasing metabolism. | Discontinue pyridoxine or increase dose of antiepileptic drug. |
| Isoniazid | Isoniazid acts as an antagonist and can induce peripheral neuropathy. | Supplementation recommended but limit pyridoxine to 10–50 mg/day. |  |
| vitamin B7 (biotin) | Diagnostic assays which use biotin-streptavidin technology (e.g., thyroid function tests, troponin test) | False results. | Consider possible biotin interference with test results if results do not match clinical presentation. |
| **vitamin B12** | H2 blockers | Possible decreased vitamin B12 levels, but evidence is conflicting. |  |
| Metformin | 10–30% of patients who take metformin may have decreased vitamin B12 absorption. | Supplementation of crystalline vitamin B12 may be required. |  |
| PPIs​[95] | Reduce absorption (probably by inhibiting intragastric proteolysis and the release of vitamin B12 from food). | H2 antagonists. |  |
| **calcium** | Diuretics | Possible hypocalcemia (with loop diuretics) or hypercalcemia (with thiazides). | May require calcium supplementation with loop diuretics. |
| Fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, thyroid products | Decreased absorption, possible decreased efficacy, risk of treatment failure. | Consider bisphosphonate administration 30 min before or 2 h after calcium supplementation; consider temporarily discontinuing supplementation while receiving fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines. Normal dairy intake is unlikely to decrease efficacy. |  |
| **vitamin D** | Antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) | Increased vitamin D metabolism to inactive compounds and decreased calcium absorption. | Supplementation may be required. |
| Cholestyramine, colestipol, orlistat | Decreased absorption. | Supplementation may be required. |  |
| Corticosteroids | Can impair vitamin D metabolism; long-term use can contribute to development of osteoporosis, as corticosteroids also inhibit calcium absorption. | Supplementation may be required. |  |
| Rifampin | Increased vitamin D metabolism. | Supplementation may be required. |  |
| **vitamin E** | Warfarin, ASA, NSAIDs | May increase risk of bleeding. | Limit vitamin E dose to ≤200 units/day and monitor INR. |
| **folic acid** | Methotrexate (low-dose) | Increased folate requirements to prevent GI and liver toxicity. | Supplement with 1–5 mg/day. |
| Phenytoin | Folic acid may be a cofactor in phenytoin metabolism; decreased serum phenytoin levels with large doses of folic acid and potential increase in seizure frequency. | Avoid folic acid supplements >1 mg/day. |  |
| **iron** | Allopurinol | Increased iron storage in liver. | Avoid combination. |
| Bisphosphonates, fluoroquinolones, levothyroxine, levodopa, tetracyclines | Form insoluble complexes with iron. | Consider bisphosphonate administration 30 min before or 2 h after iron supplementation; consider temporarily discontinuing supplementation while receiving fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines. Avoid iron and levodopa combination. |  |
| PPIs,​[95] H2 antagonists | Decreased absorption of nonheme iron, delayed clinical response to iron supplementation. | May require change to heme iron formulation if iron-deficiency anemia occurs on chronic PPI or H2 antagonists therapy. Separate doses by at least 2 h. |  |
| **magnesium** | Bisphosphonates, tetracyclines | Forms insoluble complexes; results in reduced absorption. | Separate doses by at least 2 h. |
| Diuretics | Loop/thiazide diuretics: possible magnesium depletion.Potassium-sparing diuretics: reduced magnesium excretion. | Regular monitoring of magnesium levels required. |  |
| PPIs​[94] | Chronic long-term use of PPIs may cause hypomagnesemia.Possibly accompanied by hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. | Periodic monitoring suggested.Supplements may be required. |  |

#### Evidence-based Supplementation to Prevent or Treat Disease

| Disease/Condition | Supplement | Evidence of Benefit/Risk | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age-related macular degeneration | antioxidants plus copper and zinc | May be beneficial; data primarily from AREDS​[96] in patients with AMD. The addition of lutein and zeaxanthin or omega-3 fatty acids to the original AREDS formula did not demonstrate reduced risk of progression of AMD.​[97]For a discussion of the role of vitamins and minerals in the prevention of AMD, see Age-Related Macular Degeneration. | Discuss supplementation with specialist/family physician since data are not available for other patient groups.Beta carotene–containing formulations are no longer recommended for prevention of AMD progression because of an increased risk of lung cancer.​[96]Lutein and zeaxanthin may be a suitable replacement for beta carotene in the original AREDS formulation. |
| **calcium** | In a secondary analysis of the AREDS trial, higher intake of dietary and supplementary calcium were associated with lower incidence of progression to late AMD.​[98] | Data are inconclusive; further trials are required to determine role of calcium in the risk for AMD.Individualize supplementation based on known risk factors. |  |
| Cancer prevention, primary | **vitamin B6** | Vitamin B supplementation does not decrease overall risk of breast cancer.​[99] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of breast cancer. |
| **beta carotene** | Beta carotene supplements increase risk of gastric and lung cancer at doses of 20–30 mg/day and at any dose in patients at high risk (people who smoke, asbestos exposure).​[100]​[101] | Avoid beta carotene and retinol, especially in those at high risk, e.g., people who smoke; supplement with foods high in alpha-carotenes.​[36] |  |
| **vitamin D** | Supplementation of 2000 units/day did not decrease the risk of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer death (Vital trial);​[80] high-dose monthly supplementation without calcium similarly provided no benefit. ​[102] | Canadian Cancer Society no longer recommends supplemental vitamin D for primary prevention of cancer. |  |
| **vitamin E** | Long-term vitamin E supplementation does not prevent cancer.​[103] Supplementation increases risk of prostate cancer by 17%; effect is apparent by the third year of supplementation.​[47] | Limit or avoid vitamin E supplementation, especially in those at high risk, e.g., people who smoke. Avoid in males, especially those >60 y. |  |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | No benefit seen with EPA/DHA 480mg/320mg supplementation for breast, prostate or colorectal cancer mortality (Vital trial).​[104] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of cancer. |  |
| **selenium** | Selenium supplementation does not prevent cancer.​[47] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of cancer. |  |
| Cancer prevention, secondary, skin | **vitamin B3** | High-risk patients (i.e., ≥2 nonmelanoma skin cancers in previous 5 y) had significant reduction in the rate of development of new skin cancers.​[105] | 500 mg niacinamide (vitamin B3) twice daily; not niacin.​[105] Rebound effect seen if treatment discontinued.​[105] |
| Cardiovascular disease, primary prevention | **vitamin C** | No benefit demonstrated in observational studies.​[106] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of CVD. |
| **vitamin D** | Supplementation of 2000 units/day did not prevent MI, stroke, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, even in patients with low baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; findings were independent of skin colour.​[107]Large monthly doses of vitamin D did not show any benefit.​[108] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of CVD. |  |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation of EPA/DHA 460/380 mg daily did not lower risk for major cardiovascular events overall (Vital trial).​[104]Supplementation in patients with diabetes was not associated with decreased risk of serious vascular events (ASCEND trial).​[109] | Limit supplementation for primary prevention of CVD. |  |
| Cardiovascular disease, secondary prevention | **beta carotene** | Potential harm from antioxidant use.​[110]​[111] | Avoid routine use. |
| **vitamin B6** | No benefit seen on CV events with B vitamins.​[110]​[111] | Avoid use in patients with GFR <50 mL/min.​[112]​[113] |  |
| **folic acid** | May reduce stroke risk;​[66]​[114] benefit also has been observed in patients taking enalapril.​[115] | Applicability to the Canadian population with mandatory folic acid fortification program is uncertain. |  |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Data from randomized controlled trials are conflicting; both the VITAL and ASCEND trials suggest no benefit.​[104]​[109] The REDUCE-IT trial (which used high doses of a highly purified form of EPA in patients with hypertriglyceridemia) found a significant risk reduction in CVD and CVD- deaths.​[116]Meta-analyses suggest risk reduction in major vascular events and CVD deaths but not stroke.​[117]​[118] Risk reductions were linearly associated with dose of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation.​[117] | Omega-3-fatty acid supplementation is unlikely to be of benefit, but risks are minimal. In persons with elevated triglycerides, despite optimal therapy, high-dose supplementation with prescription-only purified EPA (icosapent ethyl) may be of benefit. Discussion with a health-care provider is recommended. |  |
| Childhood development (cognitive and visual) | prenatal vitamins | A prospective observational trial suggests preconception use (at least 1 month prior) decreased incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children at high risk.​[119] | Confirmatory trials required. |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation of formula-fed infants with omega-3 fatty acids provides no benefits for neurodevelopment or visual acuity,​[120] nor does maternal supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy.​[121]​[122] | Routine supplementation in full-term infants is not indicated. |  |
| Cognitive decline | **beta carotene** | Vitamin or mineral supplementation for cognitively healthy adults in mid or late life does not appear to have a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or risk of dementia.​[123]A small benefit of beta carotene use for 15–20 y was observed; confirmatory trials are required.​[124] |  |
| **vitamin B6** | Supplementation had little or no effect on cognitively healthy persons >60, nor in those with cognitive impairment.​[123]​[125] | Avoid high-dose vitamin B supplementation. |  |
| omega-3 fatty acids/fish oil | Insufficient data to recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to prevent cognitive decline. |  |  |
| COVID-19 | **vitamin D** | Evidence is conflicting. Some observational studies have shown that serum 25–hydroxyvitamin D levels were inversely correlated with severity of clinical outcomes.​[126]​[127] Similarly, preliminary studies suggest that supplementation may reduce risk of COVID-19 infection.​[127] Other studies did not find any association between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection or disease severity.​[123]​[127] | Ongoing trials will determine role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 management. |
| **vitamin C** | Potential for use for treatment or prevention based on ability to modulate immune response and biological plausibility.​[128]High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been used as supportive treatment.​[129] | Ongoing trials will determine role of vitamin C and zinc supplementation in COVID-19 management. |  |
| **vitamin B12** | Supplementation with 1000 units of vitamin D, 150 mg magnesium and 500 mcg vitamin B12 in a small cohort trial resulted in less need for oxygenation or ICU admission in persons ≥50 y.​[130] | Confirmatory trials required. |  |
| Diabetes type I, prevention | **vitamin D** | Supplementation, particularly alphacalcidol and cholecalciferol, appears to maintain pancreatic β-cell function in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients.​[131] | Research is ongoing. |
| Diabetes type II, prevention | **vitamin B6** | High-dose vitamin B therapy (folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12) did not slow progression of diabetic nephropathy and increased risk of vascular events. | Avoid supplementation. |
| **vitamin D** | Vitamin D supplementation (4000 units/day) demonstrated a 12% risk reduction of developing diabetes compared with placebo, but the change was not statistically significant.​[132] Supplementation may also increase likelihood of reversal to euglycemia.​[133] | Persons with vitamin D deficiency (<12 ng/mL) may show significant benefit; larger trials are ongoing. |  |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation or increased PUFA intake did not affect diagnosis of diabetes or glycemic control. | Controlled clinical trial data required to support observational data. |  |
| Fertility | **beta carotene** | Supplementation with antioxidants in males may lead to increased live birth rates in persons attending fertility clinics.​[134] However, a recent RCT did not show a benefit in semen parameters after 3 months of antioxidant therapy compared to placebo, and did not increase pregnancy or live births.​[135] Similarly, folic acid and zinc did not improve either semen quality or increase the number of live births in males with infertility.​[136] | Further trials required to assess role of antioxidants, if any, in male subfertility, as varying doses/types and combinations were used. |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation is associated with improved semen quality in patients with or without infertility.​[137]​[138] | Further controlled trials indicated to determine if live birth rates are increased. |  |
| Headache | **vitamin B3** | Riboflavin appears to have a modest effect on preventing migraine frequency; effect on children and adolescents is unclear.​[139] | Benefit may not be observed before 3 months of therapy. |
| **vitamin D** | Vitamin D alone (4000 units/day)​[140] or in combination with a statin (1000 units/day)​[141] decreased migraine frequency but not severity in adults. | Confirmatory trials required. |  |
| Heart failure | **omega-3 fatty acids** | May be considered in those with mild to moderate heart failure.​[117] | Moderate to high doses are required (i.e., >3g/day); not available in nonprescription products.Doses >3 g/day may be associated with bleeding.Monitor for bleeding if on warfarin or other oral anticoagulants. |
| Mood disorders | **vitamin B6** | Adjuvant folate may improve depressive symptoms in bipolar and unipolar depression, and in the acute phase of mania in bipolar disorders.​[142]Supplemental vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid decrease risk of depression after stroke or TIA.​[143] | Efficacy is possibly dependent on genetic polymorphisms; certain folate preparations (i.e., methylfolate) may be better suited to specific genetic profiles.​[144]Balance potential benefit of folic acid supplementation with long-term risk. Uncertain whether benefit occurs in those with or without folate deficiency. |
| **vitamin D** | In persons ≥50 y of age, vitamin D at 2000 units/day did not prevent the incidence of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms in those who were not depressed at baseline.​[145] | Vitamin D therapy is unlikely to be of benefit in preventing depression in middle aged or older adults. |  |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation at about 1 g/day does not appear to affect risk for depression or remission from depressive symptoms.​[146] However, formulations containing ≥60% EPA may demonstrate some clinical benefit.​[147]Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce risk of postpartum depression and has not been shown to improve neurodevelopment in offspring.​[122]​[148]​[149] | More studies required before supplementation is recommended. For more information, see .If supplementation is to be used, pure EPA or a combination of EPA and DHA with a net EPA 1–2 g/day for at least 8 wk as adjunctive treatment are preferred. |  |
| Multiple sclerosis | **vitamin D** | High dose vitamin D (14 000 units/day) may decrease the development of new MRI lesions, but no change in clinical activity was demonstrated.​[150] | Doses >4000 units are not currently recommended.Large trials are ongoing to determine efficacy of vitamin D for treatment and prevention of MS.Currently, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada recommends that all MS patients should receive a daily vitamin D supplementation (≥1000 units).​[151] |
| Pain, chronic or neuropathic | **vitamin B1** | In combination with diclofenac, B vitamin may have synergistic activity and reduce the treatment duration of diclofenac in acute low back pain.​[152] | Various doses of B vitamins have been used (vitamin B1 and B6 100–300 mg/day, vitamin B12 0.75–2mg/day); data require confirmatory trials. |
| **vitamin C** | Although supplementation with vitamin C 500 mg/day may help prevent complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fracture or open shoulder surgery,​[153]​[154]data to support its use in radial or lower limb fractures requires confirmation.​[155] | Low- to moderate-quality evidence shows vitamin C 500 mg/day for 50 days may be efficacious in the prevention of complex regional pain syndrome after fractures and potentially shoulder surgery. Data is most robust for supplementation after wrist fractures. |  |
| Pregnancy-related conditions and pregnancy outcomes | **calcium** | Calcium supplementation for the prevention of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (i.e., pre-eclampsia) does not appear to show a significant reduction in recurrent pre-eclampsia;​[156] however, the WHO continues to recommend 1.5–2.0 g calcium/day in populations with low dietary calcium intake.​[157] | A small or moderate effect of calcium on the risk of hypertensive disorders may exist, especially for those who have >80% adherence. Adequate calcium intake should be promoted with calcium-rich foods in those considering pregnancy. |
| **vitamin D** | Supplementing pregnant patients with vitamin D alone probably reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birth weight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage, but evidence is of low certainty.​[158]Supplementation may reduce risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.​[159]Additionally, supplementation of 2400 units/day during pregnancy was also associated with reduced odds of enamel defects in the children, but not in the incidence of caries.​[160]However, supplementation of 4400 units/day does not prevent asthma or recurrent wheeze among offspring.​[161] | Current recommendations for supplementation does not appear to reflect clinical trials and current practice.The WHO currently does not recommend vitamin D supplementation to improve maternal or perinatal outcomes unless deficient.​[162] |  |
| **magnesium** | Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce risk of perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational-age newborns or maternal pre-eclampsia.​[163] | No evidence to recommend supplementation. |  |
| Psychotic disorders/ schizophrenia | **folic acid** | Supplementation improved negative symptoms in patients with specific gene variants (FOLH1),​[164] but did not provide benefit in overall psychopathology.​[142] | Folic acid 2 mg and vitamin B12 400 mcg may be beneficial in those with FOLH1 gene variants. Research is ongoing. |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | May be beneficial for early prevention in persons at ultra-high risk of psychosis.​[165]​[166]May allow decreased antipsychotic doses, but its use for treatment of schizophrenia remains experimental.​[167]Little evidence of benefit for manic symptoms of bipolar disorder.​[168] | Requires confirmatory trials. |  |
| Respiratory conditions | **vitamin C** | Vitamin C prophylaxis is not beneficial in reducing the incidence of the common cold in the general population, but can be of benefit in persons who are under extreme physical stress for short periods of time (i.e, marathon runners, skiers, solders in subarctic conditions). No benefit is seen for the duration or severity of a cold.​[169]Vitamin C supplementation may reduce the duration of URTI in children but is not preventative.​[170] | Vitamin C supplementation for the treatment or prevention of pneumonia requires further study.​[171] |
| **vitamin D** | Daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of an acute respiratory infection (ARI) by approximately 1 ARI/y in the general population.​[172]Supplementation provided clinically and statistically protective effects by decreasing COPD exacerbations in those with vitamin D deficiency.​[173]Similarly, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to decrease asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment.​[174] | Benefit was not shown with bolus dosing of vitamin D. Effect was greater in persons with vitamin D deficiency; optimal management of supplementation to decrease ARI risk needs further assessment.​[175]Supplementation is considered safe.Consider supplementation in persons with asthma and in persons with COPD who have 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations of <25 nmol/L. |  |
| **zinc** | Zinc lozenges may reduce the duration of the common cold when administered within 24 h of onset of symptoms.​[176] | Zinc lozenges ≥75 mg/day for the duration of the cold is the recommended dose. |  |
| Rheumatologic conditions | **vitamin D** | Vitamin D levels appears to correlate inversely with RA activity; supplementation with vitamin D appears to help with pain control in early RA. Trends in reduction of disease activity and possible reduction in recurrence in RA using vitamin D supplementation have also been observed. Similarly, a reduction in biomarkers in SLE have been documented.​[177] | Adequate vitamin D levels should be achieved in all patients with SLE and RA; however, there is currently insufficient high-quality evidence for the use of vitamin D. Further trials are required. |
| **omega-3 fatty acids** | High-dose omega-3 fatty acids (>4g/day) results in a reduction of RA disease activity markers and decreases the rate of DMARD failure.​[178] | Omega-3 fatty acids may be considered as adjunctive therapy to decrease RA disease activity, especially in early disease, and may also improve blood lipid profiles.Monitor for GI disturbances, burping; potential increased risk of bleeding. |  |
| Triglyceridemia | **omega-3 fatty acids** | Supplementation reduces triglycerides by approximately 15% and is dose dependent.​[118] Doses of 4 g/day may be considered for patients with very high triglycerides levels; potential adverse effects should be addressed, and LDL levels should be monitored.​[179] | Prescription-strength EPA or EPA plus DHA reduces triglycerides by 20–30% without an increase in LDL, even in the presence of statins, and are recommended as monotherapy or in addition to other lipid-lowering agents.​[180]Monitor for GI disturbances, burping; potential increased risk of bleeding. |
