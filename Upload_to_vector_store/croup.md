#### Introduction

Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children. It is most prevalent in the late fall to early winter months.​[^[1]] The annual incidence of croup is 1.5–6 per 100 in children <6 years of age.​[^[2]] Though common in children between 6 months and 3 years of age, croup can also occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years of age.​[^[2]] It is rarely reported in adults.​[^[3]] Boys are affected more often than girls. Viruses are the most common cause, particularly parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, coronavirus (including COVID-19) and mycoplasma have also been isolated.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] 

Croup hospitalizations demonstrate a seasonal pattern, proposed to be related to the temporal prevalence of parainfluenza virus in circulation in the community.​[^[7]] In Canada, peak hospitalizations occur in October of odd-numbered years, with smaller peaks in February of alternate years. Although croup incidence is greatest between 2 and 3 years of age, infants <1 year of age are at highest risk of hospitalization compared with older children. In Ontario, croup hospitalization rates reached >250 per 100 000 children in the fall of 1993, and thereafter showed sharp decreases coinciding with the widespread introduction of corticosteroid treatment for croup in subsequent years.​[^[7]]

The majority of affected children can be safely managed at home; very few require artificial airway support.​[^[8]] More than 60% of children diagnosed with croup have mild symptoms and are treated as outpatients, about 4% are hospitalized and approximately 1 in 5000 children is intubated (approximately 1 in 200 hospitalized children).​[^[1]]​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations



| Frequency | Signs and Symptoms | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | Croup |  |
| Seal-like barking cough, hoarseness, inspiratory stridor, chest wall retractions. May have fever. | Usually worse at night. |  |
| Less Common | Bacterial tracheitis |  |
| High fever, barking cough, toxic appearance, copious secretions, productive cough, poor response to nebulized epinephrine. | Most common diagnosis after croup.Often presents following a viral-like illness, after which a child becomes suddenly worse.Respiratory distress and rapid deterioration due to thick, membranous tracheal secretions. |  |
| Epiglottitis |  |  |
| Sudden onset of high fever, dysphagia, drooling, toxic appearance, anxious appearance, and sitting or leaning forward in the “sniffing” position.Absence of barking cough.More likely to present as sore throat. | Increasingly rare after the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.There is risk of progression to complete upper airway obstruction. This is an airway emergency. |  |
| Rare | Allergic reactions, angioedema |  |
| Rapid onset of dysphagia, stridor, hypotension, and possible cutaneous manifestations (urticarial rash). | May present at any age. May have personal or family history of allergy. |  |
| Diphtheria​[15]​[16] |  |  |
| Prodromic symptoms of pharyngitis, low-grade fever, hoarse voice, dysphagia, potentially barking cough and/or inspiratory stridor. Membranous pharyngitis on examination is characteristic. | Extremely rare airway emergency. May present at any age in individual with a history of inadequate immunization. |  |
| Upper-airway abscess (peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, submandibular cellulitis)​[15] |  |  |
| Dysphagia, drooling, occasionally stridor, dyspnea, tachypnea, neck stiffness, unilateral cervical adenopathy, swelling sublingual space; onset is typically more gradual, often accompanied by fever. |  |  |
| Foreign body aspiration |  |  |
| Acute onset of stridor, choking or drooling. | Foreign object, most commonly lodged in upper esophagus, causes secondary airway compression. |  |


#### Therapeutic Choices

Patients with mild croup can be managed in the office setting, while those with moderate or severe croup should be referred to an emergency department for treatment and observation (see Figure 1).

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

#### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids (see Table 2) are the mainstay of therapy for croup, irrespective of clinical severity.​[^[29]] Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce intubations, duration of intubation, need for re-intubation, rate of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, need for additional inhaled epinephrine and rate of return to a health-care practitioner for persistent croup symptoms.​[^[27]]​[^[29]]​[^[30]]​[^[31]]​[^[32]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]] Dexamethasone and budesonide relieve symptoms of croup 2–3 hours after treatment.​[^[31]]

A single oral or parenteral dose of dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg effectively relieves croup symptoms, results in fewer return office visits and hospital admissions, and reduces the length of hospital stay.​[^[29]] Available evidence suggests that a lower dose (e.g., 0.15 mg/kg) may be sufficient for mild to moderate cases (see Figure 1).​[^[28]]​[^[38]]​[^[39]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]]

Nebulized budesonide is effective and equivalent to dexamethasone.​[^[31]]​[^[42]]​[^[43]] Routine use of inhaled budesonide is limited by cost. Patients with severe croup or who are near respiratory failure may benefit from the simultaneous administration of nebulized **budesonide** and L-epinephrine. Inhaled budesonide may also be justified for use in the rare patient who demonstrates sustained vomiting; however, there is no benefit in adding inhaled budesonide to patients receiving systemic dexamethasone.​[^[44]]

#### Inhaled Adrenergic Agonists

Based on historical data, the administration of nebulized L-epinephrine (see Table 2) in children with severe croup substantially reduces the number requiring an artificial airway.​[^[47]] Epinephrine reduces respiratory distress within 10 minutes of administration and lasts for more than an hour.​[^[10]]​[^[48]]​[^[49]]​[^[50]]​[^[51]] A Cochrane review including data from 8 randomized clinical trials concluded that epinephrine treatment was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in croup score 30 minutes following treatment.​[^[52]]

Effects of epinephrine administration wear off within 2 hours of administration.​[^[10]] Though patients treated with epinephrine may return to their “baseline” severity, they do not routinely develop worse symptoms (the so-called rebound effect).​[^[10]] Both retrospective and prospective studies suggest that patients treated with epinephrine may be safely discharged as long as their symptoms do not recur for at least 2–3 hours after treatment.​[^[52]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]]​[^[55]]​[^[56]]​[^[57]]

L-epinephrine 1:1000 administered via nebulization is as effective and safe as the racemate form, which is no longer available in Canada.​[^[52]]​[^[58]] A single-sized dose (5 mL of epinephrine 1:1000) is used in all children regardless of size. Children’s relative size of tidal volume is thought to modulate the dose of drug actually delivered to the upper airway.

Back-to-back administration of epinephrine can be used in children near respiratory failure; however, there is one report of an otherwise normal child with severe croup treated with 3 nebulizations of epinephrine within 1 hour who developed ventricular tachycardia and a myocardial infarction.​[^[59]] Therefore, administer repeated doses of epinephrine only if a child is near respiratory failure and close cardiac monitoring is possible. If back-to-back epinephrine is considered necessary, the treating physician should contact a pediatric intensivist as soon as possible regarding further treatment and transport.

#### Inhaled Beta2-agonists

There are no randomized controlled trials assessing the use of beta2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) in the treatment of croup. However, as these agents have no inherent effect on upper airways, which contain no smooth muscle, benefit is unlikely; therefore, these agents are not recommended in the treatment of croup.

#### Analgesics

Analgesics may provide some degree of increased comfort by reducing fever and pain.

#### Antitussives and Decongestants

No studies have been published regarding the potential benefit of antitussives or decongestants in children with croup. There is no rational basis for their use. In addition, Health Canada warns against the use of these medications in children under 6 years of age.​[^[60]]

#### Antibiotics

As croup is a viral disease, antibiotics are not effective in its treatment; however, in rare instances, a bacterial superinfection such as bacterial tracheitis or an alternate diagnosis of epiglottitis or upper airway abscess may be suspected. These infections pose serious potential for rapid deterioration and airway obstruction, and as such, treatment includes monitoring of the airway by skilled personnel in an ICU setting and broad-spectrum IV antibiotic treatment.

**AI Image Description:**
The image is a medical flowchart for managing respiratory distress in children, categorized into three severity levels: Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Here's a detailed description:

### Mild (without stridor or significant chest wall indrawing at rest)
- **Intervention:**
  - Give oral dexamethasone (0.15–0.6 mg/kg of body weight).
  - Educate parents on:
    - Anticipated course of illness.
    - Signs of respiratory distress.
    - When to seek medical assessment.
- **Outcome:**
  - May discharge home without further observation.

### Moderate (stridor and chest wall indrawing at rest without agitation)
- **Intervention:**
  - Minimize intervention:
    - Place child on parent's lap.
    - Provide position of comfort.
  - Give oral dexamethasone (0.15–0.6 mg/kg of body weight).
  - Observe for improvement.
- **Outcomes:**
  - If patient improves (no chest wall indrawing or stridor at rest):
    - Educate parents (as for mild croup).
    - Discharge home.
  - If no or minimal improvement by 4 hours, consider hospitalization.

### Severe (stridor and indrawing of the sternum associated with agitation or lethargy)
- **Intervention:**
  - Minimize intervention (as for moderate croup).
  - Provide blow-by oxygen (optional unless cyanosis is present).
  - Nebulized L-epinephrine (5 mL of 1:1000).
  - Give oral dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg of body weight; may repeat once).
  - If unable to take oral medication, consider administering budesonide (2 mg) nebulized with epinephrine.
- **Outcomes:**
  - Good response to nebulized epinephrine:
    - Observe for at least 2 hours for recurrence.
    - If persistent mild symptoms without recurrence of chest wall indrawing or stridor at rest, educate parents and discharge home.
    - If recurrence of severe respiratory distress, repeat nebulized epinephrine and continue to observe if good response.
  - Poor response to nebulized epinephrine:
    - Repeat nebulized epinephrine.
    - Contact pediatric ICU for further management.

### Consider Hospitalization (general ward) if:
- Received corticosteroid ≥4 hours ago and continued moderate respiratory distress (stridor at rest or chest wall indrawing) without agitation or lethargy.
- Recurrent episodes of agitation or lethargy, contact pediatric ICU.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing respiratory distress in children based on severity, with specific interventions and outcomes for each category.

#### Drug Table


**Drug Class: Adrenergic Agonists**


**Drug Class: Corticosteroids**

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L-epinephrine** (Adrenalin, generics) | 5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) solution via nebulizer used for all children regardless of age and size | Use for rapid response in children with severe respiratory distress.Positive effects of epinephrine last up to 2 h; patients should be observed for at least 2 h before discharge. |
| **dexamethasone** (generics) | 0.15–0.6 mg/kg PO/IM/IV once.​[27]​[28]​[29] May supplement initial dose in 6–24 h as necessary. Maximum 0.6 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day, whichever is less | Benefit demonstrated for all patients diagnosed with croup regardless of severity (mild-severe); reduces symptoms, sleep loss and parental anxiety, rate and duration of intubation, rate and duration of hospitalization, and rate of return to medical care.While both oral and parenteral dexamethasone are effective, oral is preferred as it is less distressing for the child.Onset of action: 2–3 h after treatment.No evidence to suggest multiple doses provide additional benefit over a single dose. |
| **budesonide** (Pulmicort, generics) | 2 mg (4 mL of 0.5 mg/mL solution) via nebulizer. May repeat dose in 6–24 h if necessary | Inhaled budesonide has been shown in several studies to be equivalent to oral dexamethasone but is more expensive.A good option for patients with vomiting or severe respiratory distress (may be nebulized together with epinephrine).No evidence to support combining with oral dexamethasone. |
