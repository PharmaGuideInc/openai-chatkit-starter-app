#### Introduction

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a predisposition to unprovoked seizures. Treatment of epilepsy entails not only prevention of seizures but also the management of biological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this disorder. This chapter focuses mainly on the role of antiseizure medications (ASMs; also known as antiepileptic drugs or AEDs) in adults with epilepsy and also outlines other important considerations in the management of this complex disease.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provides a practical definition of epilepsy as a brain disease defined by either 2 unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, 1 unprovoked seizure and a high (>60%) probability of further seizures over the next 10 years, or 1 unprovoked seizure and a clearly identifiable epilepsy syndrome (electroencephalogram [EEG] demonstrates generalized interictal epilepsy abnormalities).​[^[1]] There are many seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, and the classification system for seizures and epileptic disorders can be intimidating to new learners.​[^[2]] 

#### Goals of Therapy

Figure 1 illustrates an algorithm for the management of seizures and epilepsy.

#### History



#### Clinical Features

A seizure is classified as “focal” if it originates (by semiology or EEG localization) in one hemisphere of the brain and “generalized” if it appears simultaneously in both hemispheres.​[^[3]] See Table 1 for a comparison of the most common seizure types. Since traditional terminology is still used by many practising clinicians, for the purpose of clarity, newer terminology for epileptic seizure types are provided with the traditional terms in parentheses.​[^[3]]

Consider whether the clinical features suggest one of the entities commonly mistaken for epileptic seizures, such as syncope or psychogenic nonepileptic spells, migraine, or transient ischemic attack (TIA).​[^[4]]​[^[5]] 

| Seizure Type | Clinical Features |
| --- | --- |
| Focal (Partial) Seizures |  |
| Focal seizures without impairment of awareness (simple partial seizures) | Usually brief (<1 min)Motor, sensory, autonomic or cognitive featuresAura may be present |
| Focal seizures with impairment of awareness (complex partial seizures) | Usual duration of 1–2 minFocally originating seizures characterized by behavioural arrest, often manifested as a blank stareFrequently accompanied by motor automatisms, e.g., lip smacking and chewing movements Aura may be present; brief postictal confusion is commonCan begin without impairment of awareness before progressing or can have impairment of awareness at onsetCommonly misdiagnosed as absence seizures |
| Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures)​[3] | Begin as focal seizures but evolve to look like tonic-clonic seizures. A careful history may help identify focal features at onset (e.g., aura), thereby distinguishing them from generalized tonic-clonic seizures |
| Generalized Seizures​[4]​[5] |  |
| Absence (“petit mal”) seizures | Last only seconds (usually 5–10)No warning signs or postictal confusionRecur daily (often in clusters) in the untreated patientOnset in childhood or adolescence (almost never begin in adulthood) |
| Generalized tonic-clonic (“grand mal”) seizures | Duration of 1–2 minFairly uniform sequence of motor features (tonic and clonic phases)Impaired consciousness, apnea and cyanosisPostictal stupor, confusion and headache |
| Atonic seizures | Abrupt loss of consciousness and muscle toneReturn to awareness within secondsNo other motor featuresOccur as part of a clinical syndrome in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy, significant intellectual disability and other seizure typesVirtually never occur in otherwise intellectually and physically healthy adults |
| Myoclonic seizures | Generalized seizure type consisting of brief, bilateral “shock-like” jerksMultifocal asynchronous myoclonic jerks most commonly occur in the setting of a metabolic encephalopathy |
| Status Epilepticus |  |
|  | “Convulsive” status epilepticus (SE) was traditionally defined as recurrent primarily or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting >30 min or intermittent seizures lasting >30 min without return to baseline consciousness between events. However, almost all “isolated” tonic-clonic seizures last <2 min;​[6] a tonic-clonic seizure lasting >5 min most likely suggests “impending” SE and should be treated aggressively.​[7]​[8]Any seizure type (absence, focal) can evolve to nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and this diagnosis should be considered in any patient with unexplained coma.Predisposing factors include subtherapeutic antiseizure medication serum levels (often related to nonadherence), drug withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines), and acute or chronic structural brain injury or tumor. |

#### General Safety Measures and Seizure Precautions



#### Pharmacologic Choices

Deciding whether ASM treatment is indicated following a first seizure is an important consideration (see The First Seizure).

The choice of an ASM depends on the seizure type (see Table 2), potential for drug interactions and side effects (see Table 7), desired titration speed, comorbidities (e.g., migraine, chronic pain, psychiatric disease), cost, patient preference and physician familiarity with the drug.​[^[23]]​[^[24]] 

| Seizure Type | First-Choice Monotherapy​[a] | Alternative Monotherapy or Add-On | Antiseizure Medications to Be Avoided or Used With Caution (Could Worsen Seizures) |

| Focal or unclassified tonic-clonic | **lacosamide** | **eslicarbazepine** |  |


#### Basic Principles

Basic principles for initiating ASM therapy:



#### The First Seizure



#### Focal Seizures

 In a large, multicentre trial comparing ASMs for patients with focal seizures, lamotrigine was better tolerated than carbamazepine and was similarly effective in obtaining long-term seizure freedom.​[^[31]] The other ASMs used in the trial, gabapentin, topiramate and oxcarbazepine, were not superior to carbamazepine. A follow-up study comparing lamotrigine to other ASMs, including levetiracetam, further established lamotrigine as the first-line agent of choice for focal onset epilepsy both in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.​[^[32]]

**Levetiracetam **monotherapy was not superior to the “older” ASMs in a large, open-label study comparing levetiracetam to controlled-release carbamazepine (in patients with focal seizures).​[^[33]] There is limited evidence comparing other, newer agents such as **brivaracetam**, **eslicarbazepine**, **lacosamide**, **oxcarbazepine** and **perampanel **to the older ASMs.​[^[34]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]] However, a single large trial showed that lacosamide is noninferior to carbamazepine for use as monotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy.​[^[37]]

Cenobamate was approved as adjunctive therapy for managing partial-onset seizures in adults by Health Canada in June 2023.

#### Generalized Seizures

A parallel trial for patients with generalized seizures showed that valproic acid was superior to lamotrigine and topiramate.​[^[38]]​[^[39]] Valproic acid was particularly effective in maintaining long-term seizure freedom in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. A follow-up trial, looking at a similar population, showed that levetiracetam was also inferior to valproic acid in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.​[^[40]] However, these trials were not designed to measure pregnancy outcomes, and there is evidence that among the commonly used ASMs, valproic acid may pose the highest risk to the fetus in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Most guidelines recommend that valproic acid should not be prescribed to patients of childbearing potential unless other options are either ineffective or intolerable; reasonable alternatives include levetiracetam and lamotrigine.

#### Childhood Absence Epilepsy

For childhood absence epilepsy, ethosuximide and valproic acid are similarly effective in preventing seizures, and both medications are superior to lamotrigine.​[^[41]] Ethosuximide is associated with lower rates of attention difficulties and fewer behavioural problems than valproic acid and is usually the drug of first choice in childhood absence epilepsy.​[^[42]] However, ethosuximide is not effective in preventing other seizure types such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and should not be used as monotherapy in children with multiple seizure types.

#### Status Epilepticus

For a summary of the management of Status Epilepticus, see Table 3.

In patients with a history of status epilepticus or prolonged seizures, rescue medications that can be administered at home by caregivers may be prescribed in consultation with a neurologist.

| Time Since Symptom Onset | Management |

| 6–10 min | **midazolam** |
| 11–30 min | **lacosamide** |
| 31–60 min | Obtain neuroimaging (CT, MRI) if etiology of SE not known; consider lumbar puncture if a possibility of meningitis-encephalitisAdmit to intensive care unit, obtain expert advice, arrange EEG |

#### Managing the Adverse Effects of Antiseizure Medications

Many people with epilepsy will experience adverse effects related to ASM use, which can be divided into dose-related effects, idiosyncratic reactions​[^[8]] and long-term effects of ASM use. See Table 4 and Table 7 for details about common and serious adverse effects of specific ASMs.

| Adverse Effect | Description | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dose-related effects | The most common dose-related adverse effects from ASMs include dizziness, sedation, fatigue, ataxia, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, and nausea. | In most cases, these adverse effects can be ameliorated with a reduction in dose, if deemed to be safe in terms of seizure control.If the adverse effects are suspected to be related to the peak dose of an immediate-release medication (i.e., symptoms that occur when the serum level has peaked, usually within 30–60 min after each dose), consider slow-release formulations of ASMs (such as long-acting carbamazepine), more frequent administration with lower doses of the immediate-release ASM, or bedtime dosing of once-daily medications to minimize peak effects during waking hours. |
| Skin rash | The ASMs most likely to cause skin rash include phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine, although rash has been reported with almost every ASM.​[45]Patients who have experienced skin rash with one ASM are much more likely to develop a skin rash with another ASM associated with high risk of rash.​[46]Rash is most likely to occur within the first 6 wk of ASM introduction, but can occur at any time during treatment. | If a definite drug rash develops, the ASM should be stopped immediately. Continuation of ASMs after a skin rash develops can result in life-threatening reactions (see Drug-Induced Skin Reactions).In patients with a history of ASM-related skin rash, consider an ASM with low risk of skin rash and not chemically related to the offending agent. Introduce the ASM slowly and monitor carefully for rash.Carriers of HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 are at greater risk of CBZ-induced skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Genetic testing for HLA-B*15:02 is strongly recommended for patients with ancestry from countries with higher prevalence of allele expression (China, Thailand, Malaysia and India).​[47] |
| Blood and/or hepatic dyscrasias | Mild elevations (<2–3 times the upper limit of normal) in liver enzymes and/or modest reductions in blood counts (e.g., neutropenia with carbamazepine, thrombocytopenia with valproic acid) are relatively common.Enzyme inducing ASMs increase the risk of hyperlipidemia.​[48] | Obtain a baseline CBC and serum liver aminotransferases if treating with an ASM that may cause a hypersensitivity syndrome involving blood or liver; repeat in 4–6 wk. These minor changes do not require discontinuation of treatment; follow such abnormalities with serial blood tests. If CBC and liver enzymes remain stable, the frequency of repeat blood work can be gradually decreased. Yearly blood work is appropriate in stable patients. |
| Osteoporosis | Long-term use of valproic acid and enzyme-inducing ASMs (see Table 5) has been associated with increased risk of low bone density and fracture.​[49] | In patients taking these medications, bone density should be monitored carefully according to osteoporosis guidelines (see Osteoporosis), and supplementation with vitamin D and calcium should be considered. |

#### Discontinuing Antiseizure Medications

In selected patients, after a significant duration of seizure freedom, antiseizure medication withdrawal can be considered. Withdrawal from ASMs, even after long periods of seizure freedom, can be associated with considerable risk of recurrent seizures.​[^[50]] A decision to withdraw ASMs has implications for driving, personal safety and psychological well-being. Such a decision should be made in consultation with a neurologist or epilepsy specialist.

#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Because seizure disorders often affect patients during their childbearing years, it is important to consider the interaction between pregnancy/breastfeeding and the patient with epilepsy in a positive and proactive manner.​[^[52]]​[^[53]]​[^[54]] Approximately 90% of patients with epilepsy who are seizure-free for at least 9 months prior to pregnancy will remain seizure-free during pregnancy.

Dosing schedule may require modification if on concomitant ASMsUsual maintenance: 100–400 mg/day in 2 divided doses | Rash 5–10%, which rarely can be very serious; insomnia. | Advantages: BID dosing, broad spectrum, no enzyme induction (few interactions); some patients report feeling more “alert,” increasing evidence for monotherapy, increasing use for primary generalized seizures.Disadvantages: Very slow dose titration required to minimize risk of rash.Metabolism markedly inhibited by valproic acid/divalproex sodium and increased by enzyme-inducing ASMs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone).Addition of hormonal contraceptives may reduce lamotrigine serum levels by up to 50%.Expensive at high doses. |
| **levetiracetam** (Keppra, pdp-Levetiracetam, other generics) | Generalized tonic-clonic seizuresAbsenceMyoclonicTonic/atonicFocalUnclassified tonic-clonic | Initial: 1000 mg/day PO in 2 divided doses; increase by 1000 mg/day at weekly intervals Usual maintenance: 1000–3000 mg/day in 2 divided doses | Sleepiness, decreased energy, headache, irritability, depression, psychiatric and behavioural abnormalities. | Advantages: BID dosing, broad spectrum, minimal drug interactions, rapid titration. Parenteral form available.Disadvantages: Psychiatric side effects (see Adverse Effects). |
| **perampanel** (Fycompa, generics) | Generalized tonic-clonic seizuresFocalUnclassified tonic-clonic | Initial: 2 mg/day HS PO; increase by 2 mg at 2-wk intervals as toleratedPatients taking enzyme-inducing ASMs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine) can start at 4 mg/dayUsual maintenance: 4–8 mg/day HSMaximum: 12 mg HS | Dizziness, fatigue, sleepiness, unsteadiness, weight gain.Serious psychiatric reactions, such as aggression, irritability and homicidal ideation, in patients with and without prior psychiatric history; increase monitoring during titration and at high doses; avoid alcohol. | Advantages: Once daily dosing at bedtime.Disadvantages: Cost.Substrate of CYP3A4; therefore, many potential drug interactions.CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol) increase the risk of somnolence, reduced alertness, anger, confusion, depression. |
| **rufinamide** (Banzel) | Tonic/atonic seizuresAdjunctive treatment of generalized seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome | Initial: 400 mg/day PO in 2 divided doses; increase by 5 mg/kg/day at 2-wk intervals as toleratedUsual maintenance: 1800–3200 mg/day in 2 divided doses | Headache, sleepiness, dizziness, nausea/vomiting; rash, which rarely can be very serious; shortening of QTc interval. | If used, should be initiated and followed by epilepsy specialist. |
| **stiripentol** (Diacomit) | Adjunctive therapy for refractory and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome) | Increase over 3 days to recommended dose of 50 mg/kg/day PO in 2–3 divided doses | GI upset, anorexia, weight loss, ataxia, agitation, neutropenia. | If used, should be initiated and followed by epilepsy specialist.Inhibits several CYP450 enzymes and therefore potential for several drug interactions. Not recommended in combination with carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.Clobazam requires dose reduction before initiation. |
| **topiramate** (Topamax, generics) | Generalized tonic-clonic seizuresMyoclonicTonic/atonicFocalUnclassified tonic-clonic | Initial: 50–100 mg/day PO in 2 divided doses; increase gradually by 50 mg/day at 1-wk intervals for first 4 wk, and then by 100 mg/day at 1-wk intervals for wk 5–6Usual maintenance: 200–400 mg/day | Cognitive/memory impairment common; kidney stones; weight loss; headache; fingers/toes paresthesias. | Advantages: BID dosing, broad spectrum, safe, few drug interactions, potent ASM with broad spectrum of activity.Disadvantages: Slow titration required to minimize cognitive effects.May decrease efficacy of hormonal contraceptives.Cognitive effects commonly limit use. |
