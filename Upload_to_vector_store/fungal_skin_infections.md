#### Introduction

Superficial fungal infections are very common skin diseases affecting the majority of people at some point in their lifetime. Numerous fungi are capable of invading the epidermis, hair, nails and mucosa. Three genera of dermatophytes (*Trichophyton*, *Epidermophyton* and *Microsporum*) and yeastlike fungi, *Candida* and Malassezia, are responsible for most infections.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] This chapter is divided into 3 sections: Dermatophyte Infections, Yeast Infections: Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) and Yeast Infections: Cutaneous Candidiasis. Table 1 provides information on the characteristics and differential diagnosis of fungal skin infections.

| Condition | Characteristics | Differential Diagnosis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infections caused by dermatophytes (see Dermatophyte Infections)​[a] |  |  |
| Tinea barbae | Causative organism(s): Most common: Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton verrucosum.Distribution: Coarse hair of the beard area and occasionally the mustache.Lesions: Usually unilateral; may appear as scaly patches or as reddened areas (more likely on lighter skin) or hyperpigmented (more likely on darker skin) areas, with perifollicular papules and pustules, or swollen, inflamed purulent mass (kerion) and hair loss.Risk Factors:Adult males or hirsute womenFarm workers (as it is primarily caused by a zoophilic organism)Direct or indirect contact (via fomite) with infected person or animalMoist conditions including occlusive clothing, humid climatesImpaired immunity states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, chemotherapy)Genetic predisposition | Folliculitis (bacterial or candidal): small pustules around hair follicles.Perioral dermatitis: papules and pustules surrounding the mouth and chin. Often includes a history of topical steroid use. .Acne vulgaris: pustules and blackheads affecting other areas of the face as well. Acne rosacea: pustules; dilated or broken blood vessels with facial flushing involving cheeks, which is more common and more noticeable on lighter skin compared to darker skin. Contact dermatitis: itchy vesicles and papules that become scaly, thickened and itchy when chronic. See Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis. |
| Tinea capitis | Causative organism(s): Trichophyton tonsurans (most common), Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum canis; less common and varying by geographic location: various other species.Distribution: Scalp hair follicles and adjacent skin.Lesions: “Black dot tinea capitis” (most common): annular patch of itchy, scaling skin and hair loss. Hairs may break off flush with the scalp surface, and debris in the follicle formerly occupied by hair appears as black dots.“Gray patch tinea capitis” contracted from cats and dogs; causes loss of the hair sheath in the affected area. This results in the hair turning grey and breaking 1–2 mm above the scalp, creating a frosted appearance. An initial erythematous or hyperpigmented scaling patch eventually subsides. The patch may be less erythematous and more hyperpigmented on darker skin compared to lighter skin.In some patients, a hypersensitivity response may lead to development of a boggy inflammatory mass called a kerion that can result in scarring and permanent hair loss.Risk Factors:Age: primarily affects childrenIn North America, children of African-American descent are more commonly affected than other groups​[b]Low socioeconomic and crowded environmentsDirect or indirect contact (via fomite) with infected person or animalMoist conditions including occlusive clothing, humid climatesImpaired immunity states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, chemotherapy) | Seborrheic dermatitis: yellow, greasy scales; often involves the hairline and face. See Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis.Impetigo: honey-coloured crusts. See Bacterial Skin Infections.Psoriasis: symmetric distribution of silvery scales on reddened (more likely on lighter skin) or hyperpigmented base (more likely on darker skin). See Psoriasis.Alopecia areata: small nonscaly patches of sudden hair loss. See Hair Care and Hair Growth.Trichotillomania: broken hairs, black dots.Discoid lupus erythematosus: scarring, scaly plaques. |
| Tinea corporis | Causative organism(s): Trichophyton rubrum (most common worldwide), various other trichophyton and microsporum species.Distribution: Usually the smooth and hairless (glabrous) areas of the trunk or limbs (excluding the face, hands, feet and groin); known as Tinea faciei if it occurs on a nonbearded area of the face.Lesions: Typically round, erythematous (more likely on lighter skin) or hyperpigmented (more likely on darker skin) patch; scaly with a clearing central portion and a raised vesicular border that advances circumferentially outward. See photos: Photo 1: Tinea Corporis, Photo 2: Tinea Corporis.Risk Factors: Athletes in sports with skin-to-skin contact, such as wrestling, where it is called tinea corporis gladiatorum​[14]Direct or indirect contact (via fomite) with infected person or animalMoist conditions including occlusive clothing, humid climatesImpaired immunity states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, chemotherapy)Genetic predisposition | Psoriasis: thick and silvery scales often in a symmetrical arrangement. See PsoriasisSeborrheic dermatitis: yellow, greasy scales affecting face, scalp and central chest. See Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis.Nummular eczema: smaller lesions usually affecting arms, legs and neck.Contact dermatitis: acute onset of itchy vesicles. See Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis.Lyme disease: an initial erythematous or hyperpigmented circular lesion (erythema migrans) with a central clearing at the site of the tick bite. It lacks scales. On darker skin the lesion may be less erythematous and more hyperpigmented than on lighter skin. See Insect Bites and Stings.Pityriasis rosea: acute onset of small, scaled lesions in a Christmas tree distribution on the trunk. A single herald patch that can be mistaken for tinea corporis appears on the trunk or neck up to 3 weeks preceding this rash. |
| Tinea cruris (“jock itch”) | Causative organism(s): T. rubrum (most common),T. mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum.Distribution: Symmetrical, involving the groin area (medial and upper parts of the thigh and the pubic area). Occasionally the anal cleft is affected. Unlike yeast infections, the scrotum and penis are usually spared.Lesions: Annular, erythematous or hyperpigmented patch with scales and central clearing. Patches may be less erythematous and more hyperpigmented on darker skin compared to lighter skin. The borders are well defined. Pruritus is common.Risk Factors:Males (occurs most often in the summer months)Individuals with an infection on the feet, which is spread to the groin while putting on underwearDirect or indirect contact (via fomite) with infected person or animalMoist conditions including occlusive clothing, humid climatesImpaired immunity states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, chemotherapy)Genetic predisposition | Yeast Infections: Cutaneous Candidiasis: very red on lighter skin and less noticeable or appearing as hyperpigmentation on darker skin, with poorly defined borders and satellite lesions (vesicles, papules) outside the borders of the rash. The scrotum or penis may be involved. Erythrasma: overgrowth of normal skin bacterium, Corynebacterium minutissimum; presents as bilateral, irregular-shaped, brown plaques with scales found in intertriginous (skinfold) areas.Psoriasis: symmetrical erythematous or hyperpigmented patches. See Psoriasis.Seborrheic dermatitis: usually also involves the scalp, face and central chest. See Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis. |
| Tinea manuum | Causative organism(s): T. rubrum (most common),T. mentagrophytes and E. floccosum.Distribution: Palmar surface of the hand more often than the back (dorsal aspect) of the hand.Lesions: Palmar: diffuse dryness and hyperkeratosis. Dorsal: usually dry, mild diffuse scales on an erythematous (more likely on lighter skin) or hyperpigmented (more likely on darker skin) base.Risk Factors: Individuals with tinea pedis (athlete’s foot), in which case there may be 2 feet and 1 hand (the dominant one used for scratching the foot) involved (“two feet–one hand syndrome”)Direct or indirect contact (via fomite) with infected person or animalMoist conditions including occlusive clothing, humid climatesImpaired immunity states (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, chemotherapy)Genetic predisposition | Allergic or contact dermatitis: acute onset and very pruritic. See Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis.Atopic dermatitis: usually involves other skin areas. See Atopic, Contact, and Stasis Dermatitis.Psoriasis: silvery scale; involved nails are pitted. See Psoriasis. |
| Infections caused by yeast (see Yeast Infections: Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) and Yeast Infections: Cutaneous Candidiasis) |  |  |
| Yeast Infections: Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) | Causative organism(s): Malassezia species (most common: Malassezia globosa, Malassezia sympodialis and Malassezia furfur).Distribution: Back, chest, upper arms.Lesions: Commonly: asymptomatic, multiple white to reddish-brown macules that may coalesce to form large patches of various colours ranging from white to tan. A fine scale is apparent when scratched. The lesions may not tan or darken on exposure to sunlight in the same manner as the surrounding skin. See photos: Photo 3: Tinea Versicolor, Photo 4: Tinea Versicolor, Photo 5: Tinea Versicolor.Risk Factors: Postpubertal children and young adultsWarm, humid climatesGenetic predisposition, immunodeficiency (including due to systemic corticosteroids), malnutrition, oily skin, hyperhidrosis or oral contraceptive use​[13]Not due to poor hygieneNot considered contagious | Vitiligo: nonscaly, chalk-white lesions.Seborrheic dermatitis: yellow, greasy scales involving the chest as well as the scalp.

#### Dermatophyte Infections

#### Pathophysiology

The dermatophytes (an umbrella term that includes the genera *Microsporum*, *Trichophyton* and *Epidermophyton*) survive on dead keratin and do not invade living tissue. They affect the top layer of the epidermis, hair, nails and skin. Mucosal tissues are spared as they lack a keratin layer. Infections are transmitted through direct contact with infected persons or fomites, or occasionally infected soil or animals. Dermatophyte infections are commonly called ringworm or tinea, which means fungus. Classification of tinea infections is based on their anatomic location rather than the fungal species.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] See Table 1 for information on characteristics and differential diagnosis of tinea barbae, capitis, corporis, cruris and manuum. This section does not address tinea unguium (see ), tinea pedis (see Athlete's Foot), tinea faciei, tinea nigra or tinea imbricata.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Assess patient for location and distribution of lesions, presence of aggravating factors, effect on quality of life and previous treatments attempted. Characteristics and differential diagnosis of dermatophyte infections can be found in Table 1. Also see , .

Further assessment and/or treatment is required in those patients who are:​[^[5]]

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a skin condition on the cheek of an individual. The affected area is characterized by a circular, raised, and scaly patch. The lesion appears to have a well-defined border and is slightly erythematous (reddish) compared to the surrounding skin. The center of the patch seems to be more scaly and possibly dry. This appearance is consistent with a dermatological condition such as tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm, which is a fungal infection of the skin.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy





#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Topical antifungal treatment is effective for tinea corporis and tinea cruris.​[^[17]]​[^[18]] Topical therapy may be attempted for tinea manuum, but because of the thickness of the palmar skin and frequent association with fungal infection of the fingernails, systemic therapy is often necessary. Tinea barbae and tinea capitis require systemic therapy as topical antifungals do not adequately penetrate the hair follicles.



More information regarding medications used for fungal skin infections can be found in Table 4 and guidance regarding their use during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 2.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 3 provides a monitoring plan for patients with fungal skin infections. Advise patients that although improvement in redness, scaling, itch and irritation may occur within 2–3 days of starting therapy, the full treatment course must be completed to prevent recurrence.

#### Yeast Infections: Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor)

#### Pathophysiology

Pityriasis versicolor is an infection of the stratum corneum of the skin where sebaceous glands are present. Since the term tinea refers to diseases caused by dermatophytes, the preferred term for this infection, which is caused by yeast (and not dermatophytes), is pityriasis (meaning scaling) versicolor (denoting a variety of colours or changing colours). The yeasts involved are *Malassezia* species (formerly called *Pityrosporum orbiculare* or *Pityrosporum ovale*), which normally colonize the skin but can cause an opportunistic infection. Pityriasis versicolor affects about 3% of the general population and is primarily a cosmetic problem where the lesions may not tan or darken on exposure to sunlight in the same manner as the surrounding normal skin. Recurrence rates are as high as 80%.​[^[32]] See Table 1 for more information on the pathophysiology of pityriasis versicolor.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

Characteristics and differential diagnosis of pityriasis versicolor can be found in Table 1. Also see photos: , , . If the etiology of the infection is unclear, patients require further assessment to confirm diagnosis.​[^[9]]​[^[33]]

![](images/fungalskininfections_pitver_ma.jpg)


**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a section of human skin with multiple irregularly shaped, light brown patches. These patches are distributed across the upper back area. The lesions vary in size and appear to have a slightly darker pigmentation than the surrounding skin. The pattern is somewhat symmetrical, and the edges of the patches are not well-defined. This presentation is characteristic of a skin condition known as tinea versicolor, which is caused by a fungal infection leading to changes in skin pigmentation.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a section of human skin, likely an arm, with visible skin changes. The skin appears to have a pattern of lighter patches or areas, which may suggest hypopigmentation. The texture of the skin looks relatively smooth, and the lighter areas are irregularly shaped and distributed across the surface. The background is a solid blue, which contrasts with the skin tone, highlighting the variations in pigmentation. There are no visible lesions, scales, or other abnormalities apart from the color changes. This presentation could be indicative of a condition affecting skin pigmentation.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For general nonpharmacologic measures for the management of all fungal skin infections, see Dermatophyte Infections, Nonpharmacologic Therapy.



#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Pityriasis versicolor can be successfully treated with a number of topical agents with antifungal activity including topical azoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole), ciclopirox, selenium sulfide, terbinafine and zinc pyrithione. These agents have all been shown to be effective versus placebo, with NNTs of 1–3; however, there is limited data on relative efficacy between these medications.​[^[31]] Data suggest that higher concentrations of active ingredients and longer duration of therapy are likely more effective.​[^[31]]​[^[34]]



Other topical agents, such as benzoyl peroxide,  propylene glycol, **topical** retinoids, sulfur, salicylic acid, and zinc pyrithione shampoo, have demonstrated some efficacy in mostly older trials.​[^[8]]​[^[13]]​[^[26]]​[^[31]]​[^[40]]​[^[41]]

Oral therapy for patients with extensive infection or those who are intolerant of or unable to use topical therapy includes fluconazole (400 mg single dose or 300 mg weekly for 2 weeks) or itraconazole (200 mg daily for 5–7 days).​[^[8]]​[^[9]]​[^[36]]​[^[42]] Oral terbinafine is ineffective,​[^[43]]​[^[44]] possibly due to the fact that it may not reach adequate concentrations in the stratum corneum as it is not excreted in sweat.​[^[31]] Oral ketoconazole is not recommended due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.​[^[45]]

##### Preventive Therapy

Pityriasis versicolor has a high rate of recurrence (up to 80% within 2 y after treatment).​[^[31]]​[^[46]] Prophylactic treatment with topical or oral therapy on an intermittent basis is often necessary, albeit based on limited evidence. Preventive treatment with once- to twice-monthly applications of selenium sulfide suspension is often recommended to reduce the recurrence rate, but evidence is lacking. Soaps or shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid or sulfur have also been used.​[^[47]] Itraconazole 200 mg taken once monthly has been used successfully.​[^[48]]

More information regarding medications used for fungal skin infections can be found in Table 4 and guidance regarding their use during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 2.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

A monitoring plan for patients with fungal skin infections is provided in Table 3. Resolution of scaling with pityriasis versicolor occurs promptly but the pigmentary changes may take weeks to months to resolve.

#### Yeast Infections: Cutaneous Candidiasis

#### Pathophysiology

Candida yeasts are part of the normal flora of the skin, oropharynx, intestinal tract and vagina. Cutaneous candidal infections can develop in warm, moist environments such as in the setting of intertrigo (an inflammatory condition of skin folds, induced or aggravated by heat, moisture, maceration, friction and lack of air circulation), when skin pH is increased, when competing bacteria are removed by antibiotic treatments or when glucose content in sweat increases (as in diabetes).​[^[9]]​[^[49]] Candidal intertrigo is often also colonized with bacteria, which can lead to a secondary bacterial infection. This may result in cellulitis, especially in patients with diabetes. In addition, the macerated skin can break down to cause fissures and ulcers, particularly in the deep folds of obese persons, leading to pain and disability.​[^[50]]

Candidal paronychia occurs in individuals who have their hands in water frequently. This condition consists of painful, reddened and swollen nail folds. Chronic infection can lead to transverse depressions of the nail plate, brownish discoloration and eventual separation of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis). See .

With impaired host defenses, candidal infections may also rarely lead to systemic infections.​[^[9]]​[^[49]]​[^[51]]

See Table 1 for more information. Information on candidiasis of the oropharynx or vagina can be found in Oral Candidiasis and Vaginal Symptoms, Hygiene and Infections respectively.

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

A description and differential diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is provided in Table 1. Also see , .

Patients with widespread, systemic or persistent, recurrent infection or those who are immunocompromised require further assessment and/or treatment by an appropriate health-care practitioner.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a skin condition characterized by numerous small, red, raised lesions. These lesions are distributed across the skin, with a concentration in certain areas. The skin appears inflamed and there is a noticeable pattern of clustering. The lesions vary slightly in size and are spread over a larger area, suggesting a possible rash or dermatological condition. The presence of a finger indicates the scale and location on the body, likely on the torso. The overall appearance suggests a condition that may require medical evaluation for diagnosis and treatment.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of a hand, focusing on the area between two fingers. There is a noticeable skin lesion located in the web space between the fingers. The lesion appears to be red and ulcerated, with a slightly irregular border. The surrounding skin shows some signs of dryness and wrinkling, which may indicate age-related changes or skin irritation. There are no visible signs of infection such as pus or significant swelling. The lesion's characteristics suggest it could be a skin condition that requires medical evaluation for diagnosis and treatment.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

For general nonpharmacologic measures for the management of all fungal skin infections, see Dermatophyte Infections, Nonpharmacologic Therapy.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Many topical agents are effective for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. There is limited evidence upon which to base recommending one agent over another.​[^[9]]​[^[52]]



More information regarding medications used for fungal skin infections can be found in Table 4 and guidance regarding their use during pregnancy and breastfeeding can be found in Table 2.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Substantial improvement should be evident within 1 week of topical treatment. If topical corticosteroids are used (with antifungals) to control an inflammatory candidal intertrigo, patients should be monitored closely for the development of a hidden bacterial infection or striae.

Persistent candidal infection may be a sign of immunosuppression, and these patients should undergo further investigation. Table 3 suggests a monitoring plan for patients with fungal infections.

#### Topical Antifungal treatment during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

| Topical Antifungal Medication​[a] | Use during Pregnancy | Use during Breastfeeding​[b] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ciclopirox, topical | No human data; however, animal data suggest low risk and absorption from topical use is minimal. Application to limited areas is likely safe. | No human data. Absorption with topical use is minimal and considered low risk to a nursing infant. |
| Clotrimazole, topical | Considered safe. First-line agent among azoles. | Considered safe. |
| Ketoconazole, topical | Limited human data; animal data suggest risk, but absorption from topical use is minimal. Limit use to small areas for brief periods of time when alternatives with more evidence of safety are not an option. | Considered safe. |
| Miconazole, topical | Considered safe. First-line agent among azoles. | Considered safe. |
| Nystatin, topical | Considered safe. | Considered safe. |
| Selenium sulfide, topical | No human or animal data in pregnancy. Selenium poisoning may occur when used topically on damaged skin for prolonged periods of time; however, one study found no systemic absorption after overnight use of selenium shampoo to the torso.​[72] Likely safe in pregnancy when used in limited areas for short periods of time. | No human data. There is no significant cutaneous absorption through intact skin,​[73] making it unlikely to pose any risk to a nursing infant. |
| Terbinafine, topical | A large cohort study found no increased risk of major malformations or spontaneous abortion.​[74]Absorption from topical use is minimal. May be considered when alternatives with more evidence of safety are not an option. | No human data. Absorption with topical use is minimal and considered low risk to a nursing infant. |
| Tolnaftate, topical | Limited human data; animal data suggest risk with systemic use but absorption from topical use is minimal. Limit use to small areas for brief periods of time when alternatives with more evidence of safety are not an option. | No human data. Absorption with topical use is unknown but expected to be low, making it unlikely to pose any risk to a nursing infant. |
| Undecylenic acid, topical | No human or animal data. Agents with more evidence of safety are preferred. | No human data. Absorption with topical use is unknown but expected to be low, making it unlikely to pose any risk to a nursing infant. |
| Zinc pyrithione, topical | No human or animal data. Agents with more evidence of safety are preferred. Widely used in antidandruff shampoos and no associated concerns have been reported; probably safe with limited use.​[75] | No human data. Absorption with topical use is unknown; agents with more evidence of safety are preferred. Widely used in antidandruff shampoos and no associated concerns have been reported: probably safe with limited use. |


#### Natural Health Products

A number of herbal therapies have been used for a variety of fungal skin infections, including goldenseal, purple coneflower (*Echinacea*), slippery elm bark, St. John’s wort and tea tree oil (*Melaleuca*). There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any of these herbs.​[^[56]]​[^[57]] One study of tea tree oil in tinea pedis showed some benefit.​[^[58]]

#### Monitoring of Therapy

| Symptoms | Monitoring | Desired Outcome | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lesions specific for each fungal infection | Patient: daily for lesions decreasing in size and no more new lesions developingHealth-care practitioner: next visit | Clearing of all lesions within 4 wk | Advise patient that although improvement in redness or discoloration, scaling, itch and irritation may occur within 2–3 days, the full treatment course must be completed to prevent recurrence.If no improvement or spreading of lesions by 1 wk, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Pain, swelling, heat, redness (more noticeable on lighter skin than darker skin), hyperpigmentation (more common on darker skin than lighter skin) or drainage | Patient: daily for any evidence of new onset of these symptomsHealth-care practitioner: next visit | No development of these symptoms | Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment if these symptoms develop, as they may indicate a bacterial superinfection. |
| Recurrent lesions | Patient: watch for recurrence of any new lesions for wk or months following initial infection | No new lesions | Patient requires further assessment to rule out any underlying predisposing conditions. Emphasize preventive measures. |
| Inflammation being treated with corticosteroids | Patient: daily | Resolution of inflamed areas | If no improvement or lesion is worsening by 1 wk, patient requires further assessment and/or treatment.Emphasize correct use of cool compresses. |
| Allergy | Patient: daily while on therapy | No allergy | Stop therapy. Patient requires further assessment and/or treatment. |
| Irritation caused by topical agents | Patient: daily while on therapyHealth-care practitioner: after 1 wk or next pharmacy visit | Little to no irritation, which subsides with continued use | Stop therapy if no improvement in irritation secondary to the topical agent after several doses. |
