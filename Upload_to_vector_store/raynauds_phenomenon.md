#### Introduction

Raynaud phenomenon refers to blanching of the digits, mainly when exposed to a cold environment, followed by a second cyanotic phase then by a reactive hyperemia phase. The classic presentation of Raynaud phenomenon is a combination of these phases and is often visible through colour changes. It typically progresses from white to blue to red in lightly pigmented skin. Colour changes in darkly pigmented skin may be more challenging to discern and may present as paler fingertips or colour changes on the palmar surfaces. The symptoms may last from a few minutes to up to an hour. Raynaud phenomenon may also be triggered by emotional stress and can affect other body parts e.g., nose, lips, ears, nipples. Raynaud phenomenon is thought to occur due to abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and cutaneous arterioles. In most instances, there is no other underlying disease, but in rare cases there is one, for example, scleroderma. 

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Investigations

The investigation of Raynaud phenomenon is summarized in Figure 1.



| Drug | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Antineoplastic agents | Bleomycin-, cisplatin- and vinblastine-containing regimens |
| Beta-blockers | Unlikely but controversial; evidence implicating beta-blockers in Raynaud phenomenon is equivocal​[2] |
| Central nervous system stimulants | Cocaine, dexamphetamine, methylphenidate |
| Cyclosporine | Not dose-related |
| Ergot derivatives | Bromocriptine, ergonovine maleate |
| Interferon alfa, beta | When used for treatment of cancer, viral hepatitis and multiple sclerosis; may persist for several months after withdrawal |


#### Therapeutic Choices

The management of Raynaud phenomenon is summarized in Figure 1.

#### Nonpharmacologic Choices



#### Pharmacologic Choices

While there have been many negative studies of pharmacologic therapy for Raynaud phenomenon, these studies are often not published. This complicates the interpretation of the numerous small studies and case reports that report positive outcomes for a variety of drugs.

There are few evidence-based or consensus-based guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of Raynaud phenomenon. Figure 1 and the drugs listed in Table 2 are based on available evidence and the clinical experience of the author. Patients with primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon generally respond equally well to medications; it is the frequency of attacks, rather than intensity and duration, that is most likely to be reduced with effective drug therapy.

Dihydropyridine CCBs reduce the frequency of attacks in 40–60% of patients and are recommended as first-line agents in patients with primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] Nifedipine is the best studied in this class.​[^[6]] Patients with primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon may be advised to use a CCB of the dihydropyridine class (amlodipine, felodipine or nifedipine) 30−60 minutes before cold exposure or regularly during the winter months. If a dihydropyridine is not well tolerated, nondihydropyridine CCBs may be considered, although they are less effective for Raynaud phenomenon.​[^[4]]​[^[6]] Higher doses may be used in patients with severe primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon or if ulcers are present, e.g., systemic sclerosis.

Peripheral alpha-blockers (e.g., prazosin) are less effective than CCBs, although there are no head-to-head data to substantiate this opinion. Prazosin was more effective than placebo in patients with systemic sclerosis secondary to Raynaud phenomenon in 2 randomized trials.​[^[7]] Hypotension is a common side effect that may be better tolerated if the drug is taken continuously.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antiplatelet agents and pentoxifylline are generally not effective for Raynaud phenomenon. The ARB losartan might be an alternative if CCBs are not tolerated, since some patients improved in a small trial.​[^[8]] Nitroglycerin **2% ointment** can be tried, but may be difficult to use because it can cause headache and hypotension.​[^[9]] Other topical nitrate formulations with minimal systemic effects are currently being investigated, but are not commercially available.

Intravenous iloprost, a prostacyclin (PGI2) analogue, may be useful for short-term treatment of severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and in some cases increase the rate of digital ulcer healing; oral iloprost is less effective.​[^[10]]​[^[11]] Oral ketanserin (a serotonin receptor antagonist) reduces the duration of symptoms somewhat.​[^[12]] Neither drug is commercially available in Canada.

Bosentan, an endothelin-1 inhibitor, heals digital ulcers and reduces the Raynaud phenomenon in select patients with systemic sclerosis.​[^[13]]

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors reduce the severity of Raynaud phenomenon and may be effective in healing digital ulcers.​[^[14]] Sildenafil 50 mg twice daily reduced the frequency and duration of Raynaud attacks in patients with severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon resistant to vasodilator therapy.​[^[15]] Vardenafil 10 mg twice daily has been effective​[^[16]] as well as tadalafil 20 mg on alternate days.​[^[17]] Reducing the tadalafil dose to 5 mg daily improves tolerability and may still provide benefit.

PDE5 inhibitors and bosentan should be considered mainly for patients with severe primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon. These drugs are not currently approved for this indication, are costly, and have a number of contraindications and significant side effects. Specialist consultation is recommended before prescribing them.

Oral riociguat and local injections of botulinum toxin type A have been reported as potentially useful in very small studies comprised mostly of patients experiencing secondary Raynaud phenomenon.​[^[18]]​[^[19]] Fluoxetine is suggested as a treatment by some authors, but its effectiveness is controversial and it is not recommended.​[^[20]]

#### Surgical Choices



#### Choices during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

#### Raynaud and Pregnancy/Postpartum Period

Both primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon usually decrease substantially in frequency and intensity during pregnancy and for at least a few months after delivery. Most patients return to their prepregnancy state afterwards.

#### Management during Pregnancy and Postpartum Period

For the majority of patients whose Raynaud phenomenon improves during pregnancy, nonpharmacologic measures suffice (see Nonpharmacologic Choices). For those with persistent severe Raynaud usually related to systemic sclerosis, nifedipine can be considered if previous clear benefit has been experienced with 30 mg of the long-acting formulation. The fact that nifedipine reduces symptoms only and does not reduce complications such as digital ulcers should be discussed with the pregnant patient. Although nifedipine is not approved in Canada for use during pregnancy, there is considerable experience during pregnancy and the drug is considered safe.

#### Raynaud and Breastfeeding

Nonpharmacologic measures are the mainstay of management of Raynaud phenomenon during breastfeeding. Avoid medications if possible. CCBs are passed on to the newborn via breast milk, but only in small amounts. Nifedipine can be used safely during breastfeeding. The benefits of other classes of drugs are not clear, so any risk to the breastfeeding infant is not justified.

A discussion of general principles on the use of medications in these special populations can be found in Drugs Use during Pregnancy and Drug Use during Breastfeeding. Other specialized reference sources are also provided in these appendices.

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart for diagnosing and managing Raynaud's phenomenon. Here's a detailed description of its contents:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - **Question:** Do fingers blanch upon cold exposure or emotional stress followed by cyanosis/hyperemia?
     - **No:** Consider other vasospastic or vascular disorders.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to determine if it's a primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon.

2. **Determine Type of Raynaud Phenomenon:**
   - **Question:** Are there symptoms or signs of associated diseases?
     - **Yes:** Secondary Raynaud phenomenon; consider specific treatment for associated conditions.
     - **No:** Continue to the next assessment.

3. **Further Assessment:**
   - **Question:** Is there abnormal nailfold capillary microscopy and/or positive ANA, ENA, or ACA?
     - **Yes:** Secondary Raynaud phenomenon; consider specific treatment for associated conditions.
     - **No:** Primary Raynaud phenomenon.

4. **Management Options:**
   - **Nonpharmacologic Choices:** Implement these initially.
   - **If patient remains overly symptomatic:**
     - Use a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker 30–60 minutes before cold exposure PRN (nifedipine, felodipine, or amlodipine).
     - If side effects are bothersome, consider diltiazem, prazosin, or losartan.
     - If attacks are frequent despite drug therapy:
       - Consider daily treatment (rather than PRN) with the same medication.
       - If debilitating primary or severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon:
         - Consider phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
         - Consider investigational or surgical procedures.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to diagnosing and managing Raynaud's phenomenon, distinguishing between primary and secondary types, and outlining treatment options based on symptom severity and response to initial therapies.
