#### Pathophysiology

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 14% of Canadians.​[^[1]] The Global Burden of Disease 2015 study found that knee and hip OA ranked as the 13​[^th]-highest contributor to global disability.​[^[2]] OA is a progressive disease of the synovial joints. In the past, OA was thought to be due to daily “wear and tear” that resulted from excessive and repetitive force on the cartilage in joints. While this is partially true, OA is now thought to be a systemic disorder due to an imbalance between joint destruction and repair.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[5]] This ultimately results in a breakdown of cartilage and bone, leading to symptoms of pain, stiffness and functional disability.​[^[5]] OA is more prevalent as we age, affecting nearly half the population over 70 years of age.​[^[6]]

Synovial joints are structures in which the opposing bony surfaces are covered with a layer of cartilage. There is also a joint cavity that contains synovial fluid and is lined with synovial membrane.​[^[3]] Cartilage acts as a shock absorber and, with synovial fluid, provides a smooth, low-friction surface for movement. Surrounding the joints are the articular capsule, ligaments, muscles and tendons, all of which act to stabilize and protect the joint. 

In early disease, the joint maintains function by thickening the cartilage. As the disease progresses, the cartilage softens, becoming pitted and frayed, and pieces may break off into the synovial fluid. This causes further damage and interferes with joint function. The joint may also lose its shape, and the surrounding ligaments, muscles and tendons may start to weaken.

As the cartilage deteriorates, the joint space narrows and the bones start to rub against one another. At this point, the bones may start to remodel, leading to a thickening of the bone ends and the formation of bony outgrowths (osteophytes) and subchondral cysts. These changes may lead to joint deformities. Generally, OA is not an inflammatory condition in the same way that rheumatoid arthritis is. OA is associated with subclinical inflammation, though it is unclear if the inflammation causes joint damage, as with rheumatoid arthritis, or if it is the result of joint damage.​[^[7]]​[^[8]] Symptomatic inflammation of the synovial lining and/or joint may occur in severe OA.

The most significant risk factors for OA are advancing age and female gender.​[^[6]] Other risk factors include obesity,​[^[9]] quadriceps muscle weakness,​[^[10]] family history,​[^[11]]​[^[12]] joint injury,​[^[13]]​[^[14]]​[^[15]] and joint overuse or injury associated with certain sports (e.g., soccer)​[^[16]] and occupations (e.g., farming).​[^[18]] Individuals who hear grating, cracking or popping sounds in their joints may be at higher risk of developing OA as well.​[^[17]]

#### Goals of Therapy



Health-care practitioners can educate patients and caregivers to help them understand the condition and make informed decisions about which therapies to choose.

#### Patient Assessment

Typically, OA occurs in the hands (proximal and distal interphalangeal finger joints or the thumb base metacarpal-trapezio-scaphoid joints), knees, hips, feet, neck and back (from most to least common).​[^[19]] Asymmetrical joint pain is the most common symptom of OA.​[^[20]]​[^[21]] The synovial joints are generally insensitive to pain but can become sensitized in OA as a result of physiologic stress and damage to tissue and nerves. Pain does not arise from the damaged cartilage itself but is caused by the various stresses placed on the muscles, ligaments and tendons in the areas surrounding the cartilage as a result of the damage. The pain is usually felt near the joint during use but it may be referred elsewhere and may be felt at night or during rest with more severe disease.​[^[22]]​[^[23]] Stiffness after inactivity and limited range of motion are other common symptoms. Inflammation may or may not be present. Crepitus may be present with joint movement. Table 1 lists the signs and symptoms of OA.

| Clinical Parameter | Feature | Osteoarthritis | Rheumatoid Arthritis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Stiffness | Morning or after periods of inactivity; usually lasts <30 min | Significant, prolonged (>60 min) in the morning |
|  | Symptoms localized | Yes—limited to affected joints | No |
|  | Pain | Worsens with activity or after prolonged use (especially with weight-bearing activity) | Worsens after prolonged inactivity; usually improves with activity |
| Signs | Symmetry | Occasional | Common |
|  | Tenderness | Unusual | Over entire exposed joint spaces |
|  | Inflammation | Unusual | Common |
|  | Instability | Occasional; buckling or joint instability can result in decreased range of movement and falls | Uncommon |
|  | Multisystem disease | No | Often feel systemically unwell (e.g., can have 1 or more of fatigue, fever, chills, weight loss, hair loss, dry mouth or dry eyes) |


Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disease that often presents with joint pain as one of many symptoms. The scope of this chapter does not include the management of rheumatoid arthritis; however, symptom recognition (see Table 1) is important so that patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis can be appropriately evaluated and treated to control inflammation and delay disease progression.

For more information on the management of rheumatoid arthritis, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Since joint pain can have a number of causes, it is important to rule out more serious conditions requiring medical intervention. In particular, recent history of significant trauma; hot, swollen joints; rapidly worsening pain; joint locking; and signs and symptoms of infection should be promptly investigated.​[^[21]] Reports of arthralgia have occurred with numerous drugs; however, the numbers are small and often a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be clearly established.​[^[24]]

Figure 1 is an algorithm for assessing patients with joint pain.

#### Principles of Therapy

Current nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for OA provide symptomatic relief but are not curative and do not slow disease progression. Several evidence-based guidelines are available for the management of OA.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Choice of treatment is based on a combination of risk versus benefit assessment, cost and patient preference. Pharmacologic therapy should always be initiated in combination with nonpharmacologic modalities. If tolerated, pharmacologic therapies (except localized therapy) should be tried for at least 1–2 weeks to allow the patient to fully assess their effectiveness. An algorithm for treatment of osteoarthritis can be found in Figure 2.

#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Nonpharmacologic therapy for OA (see Table 2) should always be initiated first or started concurrently with drug therapy. The quality of published evidence supporting these modalities is varied.​[^[29]] There is reasonably good evidence that self-management education programs can improve mobility and reduce discomfort.​[^[30]]​[^[31]] In addition, evidence suggests that aerobic exercise and strength training,​[^[32]]​[^[33]]​[^[34]]​[^[35]]​[^[36]]​[^[37]] weight loss through a combination of diet and exercise,​[^[39]] and supports and braces​[^[40]]​[^[41]]​[^[42]]​[^[44]]​[^[45]] may effectively reduce symptoms and improve function. Therapies that actively engage the patient (e.g., aerobic, aquatic and strength exercises) may be more effective than passive therapies (e.g., diathermy, orthotics, magnetic stimulation).​[^[57]] Consider referring patients who wish to evaluate these options to a physiotherapist or occupational therapist.​[^[58]]

Surgery is usually reserved as a last resort for patients with severe, painful and activity-limiting OA who have tried other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities.​[^[25]]​[^[26]]​[^[27]]

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

Table 6 lists selected oral and topical medications used to treat osteoarthritis.​[^[26]]​[^[27]]​[^[56]]

For more information on pharmacologic therapy, consult the *Compendium of Therapeutic Choices*: Osteoarthritis.

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Analgesic Products: External Analgesics, Internal Analgesics and Antipyretics.

#### Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen continues to be the initial drug of choice for symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis,​[^[26]]​[^[27]] though a recent meta-analysis has called the efficacy of acetaminophen for OA into question.​[^[61]] The rationale for using acetaminophen has been the fact that some studies found it to be effective, relatively safe, well tolerated and easily accessible. Most studies of acetaminophen in OA used the maximum daily dose of 1 g QID for a short period (median 6 weeks) and show that it provides moderate pain relief and improvements in function.​[^[62]]​[^[63]] However, 3 meta-analyses showed that acetaminophen likely has a small effect on OA pain and may not be sufficient to treat OA of the knee or hip.​[^[61]]​[^[64]]​[^[65]] Maximum therapeutic doses should be tried for an adequate period (1–2 weeks) to assess efficacy. Following this trial, the lowest effective dose should be used.

Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure, which led the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to recommend that all products containing acetaminophen be limited to 325 mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit;​[^[66]] Health Canada continues to review the data to assess whether similar changes will be made in Canada.​[^[67]] Patients taking acetaminophen *must* be counselled to not exceed the recommended daily dose and to be informed of nonprescription and prescription products that contain acetaminophen.​[^[68]] Conditions such as chronic alcohol abuse and liver disease preclude the long-term use of maximum therapeutic doses and should be investigated prior to beginning therapy; however, they are not contraindications to acetaminophen therapy.​[^[69]]​[^[70]]​[^[71]] Other risk factors include fasting, malnourishment and febrile illness.​[^[72]]

#### Topical Agents

Topical diclofenac and topical capsaicin are reasonable options for patients with OA of the knee who have suboptimal relief with acetaminophen, or who cannot tolerate or are reluctant to use systemic agents.​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Initial NSAID therapy should be topical rather than oral in persons ≥75 years of age.​[^[27]] Both agents are effective in those who have OA in only 1 or 2 joints, such as the knee or hand.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]]​[^[76]]​[^[77]] Several systematic reviews have shown that topical NSAIDs are better tolerated than oral NSAIDs and have similar effects on pain and function.​[^[73]]​[^[74]]​[^[75]] In a Cochrane review, the proportion of patients with osteoarthritis who experienced a 50% reduction in pain with topical diclofenac compared to placebo was 43% versus 23% (NNT=5) for up to 6 weeks of treatment and 60% versus 50% (NNT=10) for 6–12 weeks of treatment.​[^[78]] Systematic reviews have also shown topical capsaicin to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic pain. The proportion of patients who experienced a 50% reduction in pain after 4 weeks compared with placebo was 38% versus 25% (NNT=8) for capsaicin 0.025% and 57% versus 42% (NNT=6) for capsaicin 0.075%.​[^[76]]​[^[77]]

Topical therapies may also be tried as an adjunct to systemic agents where pain relief is not adequate. Both agents should be applied 3–4 times daily. Maximal effect can take up to 2 weeks for topical NSAIDs and 4 weeks for topical capsaicin. Unfortunately, the tingling and burning sensation caused by capsaicin often prevents an adequate trial of this medication.

A systematic review found little evidence to support the use of topical counterirritants such as **salicylates** in chronic musculoskeletal pain.​[^[79]] Since they are readily available without a prescription, the potential exists for overuse of these products leading to bleeding from salicylate toxicity or drug interactions with oral anticoagulants.​[^[80]] 

Early randomized trials of topical herbal preparations suggest that ***Arnica*** or **comfrey** may also provide symptom relief but further research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings.​[^[81]]

If patients experience pain, swelling or burning from topical analgesics, advise them to stop using the product and seek immediate medical attention.​[^[82]]

#### NSAIDs

Due to their risk of serious adverse effects, NSAIDs are considered second-line therapy after failure of acetaminophen in the management of OA pain.​[^[26]]​[^[27]] Although acetaminophen is superior in terms of safety, NSAIDs are often preferred by OA patients due to better pain relief.​[^[83]]​[^[84]] Not surprisingly, patients who discontinue NSAID use due to toxicity are less willing to resume therapy with another NSAID.​[^[83]]

Celecoxib is as effective as nonselective NSAIDs for pain control in OA of the hip and knee and is associated with a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers compared with nonselective NSAIDs.​[^[85]] Like nonselective NSAIDs, celecoxib can exacerbate pre-existing renal disease. Baseline and periodic monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes is recommended for high-risk patients.

Prior to starting long-term NSAID therapy, assess patients for their risk of cardiovascular, GI and renal complications (see Table 3).​[^[85]]​[^[86]]​[^[87]]​[^[88]] If a patient has no risk factors, a low-dose of a nonselective NSAID can be started (e.g., ibuprofen 200–400 mg Q8H or naproxen sodium 220 mg Q12H). Over a 1- to 2-week trial, the dose can be titrated until adequate pain relief is achieved or the maximum dose is reached. Avoid long-term therapy if possible, but if continued therapy is needed, use the lowest effective dose. Patients who require chronic NSAID therapy should discuss their use with a health-care practitioner. Due to the serious adverse effects associated with ASA, it is not generally recommended for the self-management of OA.

Generally speaking, NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) are avoided in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, given that there are few treatment options for OA, patients may opt to use an NSAID. 

There are no definitive data to indicate the superiority or safety of one NSAID over another.

#### NSAID Risks

While dyspepsia has been reported in up to 60% of patients taking NSAIDs, the actual incidence is likely closer to 5–10%.​[^[89]] If dyspepsia occurs for more than 7 days in a month, consider discontinuing NSAID therapy.​[^[90]] Minor heartburn can be managed symptomatically with antacids or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (see Dyspepsia and GERD).

Serious GI complications such as perforated ulcers, hemorrhage and obstruction are estimated to occur at an incidence of less than 1% per year.​[^[91]] Prior to starting NSAID therapy, identify patients at risk of serious NSAID-related GI complications and take preventive measures (see Figure 2). **Histamine-2 receptor antagonists** and **antacids** provide relief from dyspeptic symptoms, but not against more serious GI complications. Misoprostol (200 mcg QID) or **PPIs** such as omeprazole (20–40 mg/day) are appropriate options for preventing serious GI complications, though PPIs are much better tolerated.​[^[28]]​[^[92]]​[^[93]]

One study examined the risk of recurrent GI bleeding in patients who were taking an NSAID who had both cardiothrombotic disease requiring ASA and GI bleeding.​[^[94]] They found that the risk of recurrent bleeding was lower for patients who took celecoxib plus a PPI compared to those who took a non-selective NSAID plus a PPI. Nonselective NSAIDs may inhibit the antithrombotic effect of ASA by competitively binding to the COX-1 receptor.​[^[95]] This theoretical interaction has not been documented with enteric-coated ASA or COX-2 inhibitors. Advise patients to take nonselective NSAIDs at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before ASA.​[^[96]]

NSAIDs can increase blood pressure in patients with normal or high blood pressure.​[^[97]]​[^[98]] When starting NSAIDs in patients on antihypertensive therapy, measure blood pressure within 1 week of starting treatment to assess whether changes to either NSAID or antihypertensive therapy are warranted. In addition to affecting blood pressure, NSAIDs can cause acute kidney injury, especially when added to antihypertensive therapies like diuretics, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.​[^[99]]

Meta-analyses of both randomized controlled trials and observational studies have shown that NSAIDs increase the risk of thromboembolic cardiovascular events such as MI.​[^[100]]​[^[101]]​[^[102]] Though naproxen was suggested to be the least harmful,​[^[103]] a 2018 randomized controlled trial found that celecoxib 200 mg/daily was associated with similar rates of cardiovascular adverse effects as naproxen or diclofenac.​[^[104]] High daily doses (e.g, >200 mg celecoxib, diclofenac >100 mg, ibuprofen >1200 mg) but not prolonged use (>30 days) are associated with greatest risk of harm.​[^[105]] It is still unclear whether the use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in high-risk patients mitigates this risk.​[^[101]]​[^[106]]

#### Natural Health Products

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Herbal and Natural Health Products: Combinations, Single Entity.

Endogenous glucosamine and chondroitin maintain the integrity of cartilage within a joint. Exogenous formulations (glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate) have been evaluated in the treatment of OA. Their pharmacologic effect is believed to mimic their physiologic effect on cartilage tissue. The proposed mechanisms of action are to stimulate the production of cartilage, prevent cartilage destruction by inhibiting inflammatory mediators and/or enzymes and maintain viscosity of the joint.​[^[107]]​[^[108]]

The majority of available evidence suggests that glucosamine hydrochloride is ineffective for pain reduction in patients with OA. One study of glucosamine hydrochloride plus chondroitin compared with celecoxib in patients with knee OA suggested comparable efficacy in reducing pain scores after 6 months.​[^[109]] The study lacked a placebo arm, which is concerning as up to 75% of the effect of analgesics in OA may be due to placebo effect.​[^[110]] Glucosamine sulfate may have function-modifying effects in patients with knee OA when administered for more than 6 months, but no pain-reduction benefits were demonstrated after 6 months of therapy.​[^[111]] 

A systematic review evaluating the benefit and harm of chondroitin for OA found that chondroitin, alone or in combination with glucosamine, was better than placebo in improving pain and had lower risk of serious adverse events compared to control.​[^[112]] A large-scale randomized controlled trial in knee OA compared the combination of glucosamine HCl (500 mg TID) and chondroitin sulfate (400 mg TID) to either placebo or celecoxib (200 mg daily). Celecoxib was the only intervention that proved efficacious. A small subset of patients with moderate to severe pain experienced some pain relief with the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin.​[^[113]] In another randomized controlled trial, glucosamine sulfate (1500 mg once daily) failed to improve pain, function or the number of medications taken in patients with hip OA.​[^[114]]

As large-scale randomized controlled trials have not shown glucosamine and chondroitin to have substantial effect, treatment guidelines for OA do not recommend these agents.​[^[27]]​[^[115]]​[^[116]]​[^[117]] However, given the great interest that many patients have in natural alternatives, it is worthwhile having a discussion with patients about the most recent evidence.

S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring substance that is produced by the body. It may promote the production of cartilage building blocks. A systematic review suggests that SAMe is well tolerated and may improve both pain and function in osteoarthritis.​[^[118]] However, a 2009 Cochrane review noted that many of the trials were small, not placebo-controlled and of questionable quality. Reviewers cautioned against using SAMe until adequately sized, randomized, parallel-group trials have been done.​[^[119]] 

**Curcuma** extract, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), **Indian frankincense** (also known as *Boswellia serrata* extract) and pycnogenol may have clinically significant short-term effects on pain reduction and function, though most studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, and the overall quality of evidence is low.​[^[120]]​[^[121]]

Other complementary and alternative products such as **avocado-soybean unsaponifiables** and **rose hip** may also be effective but high-quality evidence is lacking.​[^[118]]​[^[122]]

#### Localized Therapy

The use of intra-articular corticosteroids in OA is limited to acute knee pain and patients who have local signs of inflammation and joint effusion. If joints are painful and swollen, aspiration of fluid followed by intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide or methylprednisolone acetate) has a small and temporary effect (4–6 weeks) on pain and function though the studies are of low quality.​[^[123]] It is often used in combination with other therapies, although it can be used as monotherapy. Repeated injections may damage cartilage.​[^[124]] The injection should be provided by a qualified health-care practitioner and the same site should not be injected more than 3–4 times per year.​[^[25]]

The efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids for hand and hip OA has not been studied and use is not routine due to the risk of cartilage damage through repeated injections. Specialized health-care practitioners may provide hand or hip injections (using radiographic guidance for the latter) for certain patients.

**Hyaluronan** is a linear polysaccharide found in synovial fluid. Meta-analyses investigating the efficacy and safety of hyaluronan injections have found conflicting results.​[^[64]]​[^[125]]​[^[126]]​[^[127]] The effect of repeated courses of hyaluronan injections is unknown. Research shows that 3 weekly injections have a comparable effect to 5 weekly injections.​[^[128]] These products are usually reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Costs are high ($200–$400 per treatment course) and they are not routinely covered by insurance plans. The injections can be purchased without a prescription but they must be administered by a qualified health-care practitioner.

#### Opioid Analgesics

An opioid analgesic alone or in combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDs may be useful in patients who do not respond to other analgesics, experience acute exacerbations of OA pain, or are not willing or able to receive surgical treatments.​[^[26]] Side effects such as sedation, constipation, tolerance and dependence may limit the long-term use of these agents in many patients. However, the high risk of serious adverse effects from NSAIDs in the elderly limits their use in this population and opioids provide an alternative. Though the evidence for effectiveness and safety of opioids in this population is also contradictory,​[^[129]] the American Geriatrics Society recommends a trial of opioids in carefully selected and monitored elderly patients with moderate to severe persistent pain, pain-related functional impairment or diminished quality of life due to pain.​[^[130]] 

Evidence about the efficacy and safety of opioids in treating osteoarthritis pain has been contradictory. A randomized controlled trial of 240 patients with moderate to severe pain chronic OA or low back pain found that opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone and oxycodone were not superior to non-opioid therapy such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs.​[^[131]] A systematic review of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain concluded that there is insufficient evidence for improving chronic pain and function, and there is a dose-dependent risk of serious harms including overdose, abuse and fractures.​[^[132]] A Cochrane review of the effect of oral or transdermal opioids in knee or hip OA similarly concluded that there is small mean benefit of non-tramadol opioids in OA, but it is associated with a significant risk of adverse events.​[^[133]]

Numerous combination analgesic products containing codeine 8 mg are available. The effectiveness of low-dose combination codeine products compared with single ingredient products (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen) for OA has not been adequately studied, but they may be reasonable options for individuals at risk of serious adverse events from NSAIDs.​[^[26]]​[^[27]]

Tramadol is a partial opioid agonist used for acute pain. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDs for OA of the hip and knee if treatment with these agents has not provided adequate pain relief. Tramadol may have a small effect on pain and function, and the risk of abuse appears to be low.​[^[134]]

Any prescription of opioid should be according to the 2017 Canadian guidelines for opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain, and should likely not precede treatment with anti-inflammatories or other atypical pain relievers.​[^[135]]

#### Antidepressants

Duloxetine is an antidepressant approved for use in osteoarthritis of the knee. A pooled analysis of 2 randomized placebo-controlled trials showed the proportion of patients who experienced ≥50% reduction in pain after 13 weeks with duloxetine compared with placebo was 47% versus 31% (NNT=7). Duloxetine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDs for OA of the hip and knee if treatment with these agents has not provided adequate pain relief. Common side effects include nausea, fatigue and constipation.​[^[136]] 

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Table 5 provides a monitoring plan for patients with OA.

| Parameter | Degree | Timeframe | Action/Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pain relief | Elimination or improvement toward predefined, realistic goals as set by patient | Patient: assess dailyHealth-care practitioner: call on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 | Patient may require further assessment if no symptom relief after adequate trial of at least 2 analgesics or on development of new or worsening pain during therapy.Considerations:Use visual analog scale or other individual measure to quantify and characterize pain (e.g., ADL—walking, gardening)Establish acceptable level of pain control and functioning with the patient at the beginning of therapyTiming of medications:Around-the-clock vs. PRNTake analgesic at least 1 h prior to activities that may exacerbate pain |
| Nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort | Minimal or none during therapy | Patient: monitor dailyHealth-care practitioner: call on days 3 and 7 | Change therapy if symptoms severe or intolerable. Minimize development by advising to take with food or milk.Consider antacids or H2RAs to treat dyspepsia. |
| Hematemesis, melena, hematochezia | None during therapy | Patient: monitor daily on an ongoing basisHealth-care practitioner: call on days 3, 7, 28 then ask when medication is refilled | Assess risk of GI complications (see Table 3). If high risk, patient requires further assessment and workup.Patient should discontinue therapy immediately and seek medical attention if these signs or symptoms develop. |
| Hypertension | Stable during therapy | Health-care practitioner: measure BP within 1 wk of starting NSAIDs | Monitor patients with pre-existing hypertension; if BP increases, adjust the dose of the NSAID or antihypertensive. |
| Renal function and signs of fluid retention (e.g., weight gain or edema) in high-risk patients | No significant change in renal function | Patient: look for decreased urine production; watch for signs of fluid retention, e.g., edema. Patients with severe heart failure should weigh themselves dailyHealth-care practitioner: call on day 3 to ask about urine productionIn patients >65 y or with other risk factors, consider taking a baseline serum creatinine, repeat at 1 wk and then periodically | Assess risk of renal complications (see Table 3).Hold NSAID that day if patient cannot eat or drink.Discontinue NSAID if significant changes in serum creatinine or electrolytes or if signs of fluid retention occur. |

    - Continue with assessment including:
      - Medical history
      - Allergy history
      - Current medications
      - Previous use of prescription/nonprescription medications and natural health products for joint pain, and their effectiveness.

11. **Drug-Related Causes**:
    - Evaluate possible drug-related causes of arthralgia/joint pain.
    - If yes, evaluate and address potential drug causes as appropriate.

12. **Contraindications to Self-Care**:
    - Check for contraindications such as chronic liver disease, history of inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, gout).
    - If yes, patient requires further evaluation.

13. **Nonpharmacologic Treatment**:
    - Advise on nonpharmacologic treatment alternatives (refer to Table 2).
    - Assess treatment alternatives for osteoarthritis (refer to Figure 2, Table 3).

14. **Therapy Discussion**:
    - Discuss expected benefits and side effects of therapy with the patient.

15. **Monitoring Plan**:
    - Discuss monitoring plan with the patient.
    - If no improvement within 4 weeks, patient requires further assessment.

16. **Nonpharmacologic Options**:

**AI Image Description:**
This image is a flowchart outlining a stepwise approach to pain management, focusing on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments.

### Step 1
- **Nonpharmacologic treatment**: Includes education, exercise, physiotherapy, and assistive devices.
- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Acetaminophen (up to 1 g QID).

### Decision Point: Adequate pain relief?
- **Yes**: Monitor.
- **No**: Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2
- **Add topical diclofenac** and advise on other topical therapies.

### Decision Point: Adequate pain relief?
- **Yes**: Monitor/minimize use.
- **No**: Assess risk of adverse GI events (refer to Table 3).

### Risk Assessment for Adverse GI Events
- **Low Risk (No risk factors)**:
  - Use low-dose nonselective NSAID.
  
- **Moderate Risk (1–2 risk factors)**:
  - Use low-dose nonselective NSAID with gastroprotection or low-dose COX-2 inhibitor.
  
- **High Risk (Multiple risk factors)**:
  - Consider alternative therapy (e.g., local injections, duloxetine, opioids) or low-dose COX-2 inhibitor with gastroprotection.

### Decision Point: Adequate pain relief?
- **Yes**: Monitor/minimize use.
- **No**: Use full-dose nonselective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor with or without gastroprotection. Supplement with local injections, duloxetine, or opioids.

### Final Decision Point: Adequate pain relief?
- **Yes**: Monitor/minimize use.
- **No**: Consider surgery.

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing pain, emphasizing the assessment of gastrointestinal risk and the use of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions.

**Drug Class: Analgesics, topical**


**Drug Class: NSAIDs, oral**


**Drug Class: NSAIDs, topical**

| Drug/​Cost[a] | Dosage | Adverse Effects | Drug Interactions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **acetaminophen** (Atasol Preparations, Tylenol, generics) | 325–1000 mg Q4–6H POSR: 650 mg Q8H POMaximum: 4 g/day | Hepatotoxicity: increased risk in patients with excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks/day), malnourishment or pre-existing hepatic disease. Baseline LFTs should be measured in high-risk patients. | Acetaminophen has been reported to increase INR in warfarin-treated patients.​[59] Check INR if acetaminophen ≥2 g/day is used for ≥3 consecutive days. Adjust warfarin dosage as required.Phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine may increase acetaminophen metabolism and formation of toxic metabolite (increased risk of hepatotoxicity); risk may be increased in patients taking high therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and antiepileptic drugs chronically. | Maximal onset of pain relief within 24–48 h.Lower doses may be required in patients with severe hepatic and renal disease.Caution with concurrent use of other products containing acetaminophen (do not exceed 4 g/day).Consider continuous therapy in individuals with pain persisting throughout the day. PRN dosing is acceptable for episodic pain of short duration. |
| **acetaminophen** (generics) | 1–2 tablets Q4–6H POMaximum: 4 g/day of acetaminophen from all sources | Hepatotoxicity: increased risk in patients with excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks/day), malnourishment or pre-existing hepatic disease. Baseline LFTs should be measured in high-risk patients.Sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation. | Acetaminophen has been reported to increase INR in warfarin-treated patients.​[59] Check INR if acetaminophen ≥2 g/day is used for ≥3 consecutive days. Adjust warfarin dosage as required.Phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine may increase acetaminophen metabolism and formation of toxic metabolite (increased risk of hepatotoxicity); risk may be increased in patients taking high therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and antiepileptic drugs chronically. Concurrent use of medications that cause CNS depression (e.g., sedatives, tranquilizers, alcohol) or constipation may increase these effects. | Recommended for short-term use only, e.g., 2–3 days. Elderly are at increased risk for adverse effects.Caution with concurrent use of other products containing acetaminophen (do not exceed 4 g/day). |
| **capsaicin** (Zostrix, Zostrix HP, generics) | Apply sparingly TID–QID for 3–4 wk to achieve maximum therapeutic effect | Tingling, burning or redness (majority of patients). | None known.Concurrent use of other topical medications on areas treated with capsaicin should be avoided. | Pain relief may take up to 2 wk with daily use. Maximum effect can take up to 4 wk.Apply with gloves and wash hands thoroughly after application to avoid irritation of other areas. Tingling/burning usually decreases within 72 h with repeated use; if effect is bothersome, use lower concentration or pretreat with topical lidocaine or EMLA cream.Do not apply near mucous membranes or on broken skin. Do not cover with tight or occlusive dressing. Do not place heating devices (e.g., hot water bottle, heating pad) on skin after applying product. |
