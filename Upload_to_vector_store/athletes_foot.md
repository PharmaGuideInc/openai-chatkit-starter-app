#### Pathophysiology

Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) is a superficial fungal infection of the feet. This condition has increased worldwide to an overall prevalence of approximately 8.5%. The increase is attributed to altered lifestyle and demographics, with an aging population, increased obesity, global travel and enhanced use of public sports facilities (e.g., gyms, swimming pools).​[^[1]]​[^[2]]​[^[3]]​[^[4]] Approximately 15% of the world’s population has been diagnosed with a fungal foot infection and up to 70% will acquire this infection at some point in their lifetime.​[^[4]]​[^[5]]​[^[6]] 

Males are 4 times more likely than females to acquire the infection: 6.6% and 1.6% in 11- to 14-year-old boys and girls, respectively. The prevalence of the infection increases with age, especially in adults 31 to 60 years of age. Marathon runners have a prevalence rate of 31%.​[^[7]]​[^[8]]​[^[9]]

The most common dermatophytes (fungi) causing Athlete’s foot are, in descending order: Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale (mentagrophytes) and Epidermophyton floccosum.​[^[1]]​[^[2]] A clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with microscopy and demonstrated dermatophyte growth in culture.​[^[3]]​[^[4]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

Hyperhidrosis may contribute to the presence of tinea pedis. Warm, dark, poorly ventilated, moist environments between the toes promote fungal growth and may contribute to the presence of this condition.​[^[12]] Such environments may be created by wearing tight-fitting shoes, with or without socks or hosiery. Other risk factors for tinea pedis may include diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, occluded skin, poor hygiene, obesity and trauma.​[^[13]] Tinea pedis may be mitigated by wearing appropriately fitted (e.g., wide toe box) and breathable (e.g., leather) shoes.​[^[14]]

Tinea pedis may progress to ulceration if the infection extends into the dermis. Complications may include secondary bacterial infections that may be localized or spreading, e.g., cellulitis, lymphangitis.​[^[13]] Individuals with diabetes or those who have had saphenous vein grafts for coronary artery bypass are especially prone to secondary bacterial infections.​[^[8]]

#### Goals of Therapy



#### Patient Assessment

The presentation of tinea pedis varies and is based upon the location of the infection and the fungal species involved (see Table 1).​[^[5]]​[^[11]]​[^[15]]

| Variant | Lesion Morphology | Typical Location | Special Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chronic interdigital infection | Fissures, scaling or maceration in the interdigital spaces | Most commonly found on the lateral toe webs, usually between the 4​th and 5​th or 3​rd and 4​th toes. From this area, the infection often spreads to the instep or sole of the foot. | Humidity and warmth worsen this condition. Therefore, patients whose feet are prone to excessive sweating should be encouraged to treat their hyperhidrosis along with the fungal infection. |
| Moccasin-type infection | Chronic, papulosquamous pattern | Generally found on both feet, it is characterized by a mild inflammation and diffuse scaling on the soles of the feet. Often the toenails are affected. | Involvement of the toenails perpetuates the infection such that the toenail infection must be treated. Confirmed microscopy and positive dermatophyte culture should precede the initiation of oral antifungal therapy for up to 3–4 months. |
| Vesicular | Small vesicles | Near the instep and on the midanterior plantar surface. Skin scaling is also observed in this area and on the toe webs. | Often caused by Trichophyton interdigitale (mentagrophytes). More prevalent in the summer. |
| Acute ulcerative disease | Macerated, denuded, weeping lesions | Sole of the foot. | Hyperkeratosis and a pungent odour are usually present. May be complicated by an overgrowth of opportunistic, gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus or Pseudomonas and for this reason is often referred to as gram-negative athlete’s foot or dermatophytosis complex. |


Evidence of painful pruritic lesions, burning sensations, redness, inflammation and blisters in the favoured locations or in a characteristic pattern on the feet may indicate the presence of tinea pedis.​[^[11]] The skin may appear macerated and an odour may be present. See Photo, Athlete’s Foot.

**AI Image Description:**
The image shows a close-up of the skin between the toes, likely depicting a case of athlete's foot (tinea pedis). Key features include:

- **Redness and Inflammation**: The skin appears red and inflamed, indicating irritation or infection.
- **Peeling and Scaling**: There is noticeable peeling and scaling of the skin, common in fungal infections.
- **Moisture and Maceration**: The area looks moist, which can contribute to the maceration of the skin.
- **White, Flaky Skin**: White, flaky patches are visible, typical of fungal growth.

This condition is often caused by a fungal infection and can be exacerbated by moisture and warmth. Treatment typically involves antifungal medications and keeping the area dry and clean.

Science Photo Library

Tinea pedis may be confused with the following conditions: disturbances of the sweat mechanism; contact dermatitis, often due to dyes or adhesives in footwear; eczema; psoriasis; or bacterial infections including erythrasma.​[^[15]] The infection can be spread to other parts of the body, usually the groin or underarms, by autoinoculation, e.g., touching the infected feet then touching other parts of the body.​[^[16]]

Figure 1 depicts an approach to assessing and managing tinea pedis.

#### Prevention

Despite the lack of supporting data, individuals should be offered the following guidelines to prevent infection:​[^[12]]​[^[15]]​[^[17]]​[^[18]]



#### Nonpharmacologic Therapy

Individuals with a diagnosis of tinea pedis should follow the guidelines described under Prevention as adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment. These guidelines are intended to assist in the prevention of recurrence and transmission to others.

#### Pharmacologic Therapy

For comparative ingredients of nonprescription products, consult the *Compendium of Products for Minor Ailments*—Foot Care Products: Athlete’s Foot.

Antiperspirants or absorbent powders (e.g., talcum or aluminum chloride) can be applied to the feet to decrease sweating.

Individuals with a history of tinea pedis may regularly apply a dusting of antifungal powder such as tolnaftate once or twice daily to prevent further recurrences.​[^[19]] To prevent coagulation of powder and moisture buildup, antifungal powder should be applied directly to the feet and not be placed in shoes.​[^[19]]​[^[20]]

For a superficial, cutaneous fungal infection of the feet, topically applied antifungal drugs are the agents most often used to treat athlete’s foot. They include allylamines (terbinafine), azoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole), hydroxypyridone (ciclopirox) and others (clioquinol, tolnaftate, undecylenic acid). 

In a review of randomized placebo-controlled studies, with mycological confirmed diagnosis of fungal infections of the skin and toenails, all over-the-counter (OTC) topical antifungal creams, lotions and gels were shown to achieve some degree of success to cure athlete’s foot.​[^[11]] Strong evidence supports allylamines over azoles as the drugs of choice, with an approximate 67% relative risk reduction in treatment failure at 6 weeks.​[^[11]] Trial data also suggests that the minimum drug treatment period for athlete’s foot using either allylamines or azoles should be 2–4 weeks.​[^[11]]

Oral fluconazole, itraconazole or terbinafine may be indicated for tinea pedis infections that are resistant to topical treatment or involve the toenails (onychomycosis). Prior to initiating oral therapy, the presence of a dermatophyte should be confirmed by microscopy and culture growth.​[^[4]]​[^[10]]​[^[11]]

There is no evidence that tea tree oil is effective in the treatment of tinea pedis.​[^[11]]

Combination topical steroid and antifungal products should be avoided due to inferior efficacy compared to single antifungal drugs, increased drug costs and potential side effects related to the steroid component (e.g., skin atrophy, immunosuppression leading to enhanced fungal infection spread).​[^[3]]​[^[21]]

Sometimes a drying agent solution (e.g., **Burow’s solution [1% aluminum acetate]**) can be applied for 20 minutes 2 to 3 times per day for patients with vesicular tinea pedis.​[^[3]]

The selection of dosage form is based on individual preference. Generally, ointments remain in contact with the affected area for a longer period of time than creams; however, there is the danger of creating an occlusive barrier, which promotes skin maceration and retards wound healing. Powders may be either nonmedicated or medicated and are also absorbent. Solutions, sprays or foams applied directly to the skin should be allowed to air dry.

#### Monitoring of Therapy

Rash during therapy may indicate an allergic reaction to the product. The patient should discontinue use of the product and consult with an appropriate health-care practitioner.
